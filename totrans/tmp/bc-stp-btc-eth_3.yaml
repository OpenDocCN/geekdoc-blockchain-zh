- en: 'CHAPTER 3Liquidity and AdoptionThe totality of companies and individuals dealing
    in crypto-assets make up an ecosystem that is growing in size and maturity. Markets
    die without liquidity, so we need to grasp how the liquidity of cryptocurrency
    works. The trading volume grows because more people exchange their fiat money
    for crypto-assets and trade one crypto-asset for another. And the number of company
    relationships grows because each new company or market can expand the size and
    scope of possible deals. Just like in the natural world, this ecosystem develops
    and moves from one phase to the next.For example, traders create demand for exchanges,
    which creates demand for market makers, which together create demand for data
    and software specialists, which creates demand for analysts, training courses,
    and conferences. New crypto-assets can create new industries, such as the smart
    contract that defines a basic token on Ethereum, the ERC-20 standard, which gave
    rise to a boom in token sales, or initial coin offerings (ICOs), which in turn
    created the demand for marketing services. The invention of so-called stablecoins—which
    are tokens pegged to a fiat currency—has created a market for borrowing and lending
    with collateral and leveraged speculation. Furthermore, it is now possible to
    put digital items from online games on a blockchain, in the form of a unique token.
    Gamers and speculators trade these tokenized in-game assets on the open market.
    We can expect that the inventors of new types of assets will create other new
    markets. As an entrepreneur, you fit your mission in this maturing ecosystem.
    In chapter 6, we discuss tokenized holdings in more detail. For now, we appreciate
    these examples as evidence of progress; crypto-assets with active users prove
    that this industry is not just a speculative bubble or a science experiment.Even
    though this technology is in its infancy, we have come a long way already. When
    I discovered Bitcoin, at the beginning of 2013, you needed technical expertise
    to own bitcoins. Also, you needed luck; you could only buy or sell bitcoin in
    some locations, and the only public exchange market for bitcoin was Mt. Gox, based
    in Japan. I wanted to buy some bitcoins as soon as I heard about it, but I gave
    up when I foresaw the hassle of getting my money, Thai baht and euros, into a
    Japanese bank. Furthermore, I was too worried about the security of my wallet
    setup. I felt I had to learn more about wallets before I could trust myself to
    keep bitcoins in the long term. A bit later on, I did a writing job for someone
    who offered to pay in bitcoin, but I declined because I saw no way to spend it.
    These challenges for the liquidity of bitcoins are now over, at least for people
    like me. Handling crypto-assets gets more comfortable with time so that it becomes
    accessible to a broader range of users.The overall growth of these markets for
    crypto-assets has three limiting factors, analogous to physical friction inside
    a mechanical system:•    On-ramp and off-ramp —Trading fiat currency for a crypto-asset
    is similar to a car entering a highway via an on-ramp. The traffic on the road
    is smooth and steady, and the on-ramps and off-ramps are where cars can match
    and adapt their speed to the other traffic. When anyone wants to trade fiat currency
    for a cryptocurrency, it slows down to the speed of fiat. When you use cash, you
    have to meet in person. In case the traders do not know each other, they have
    to build trust or consider risks to personal safety. When you transfer fiat money
    electronically, your trade must comply with your bank’s rules for ‘anti-money
    laundering’ (AML) and ‘know your customer’ (KYC). They tend to force you to limit
    your transaction size and demand explanations of the source of the funds. Regulatory
    authorities require them to do this as a condition for keeping their license to
    transmit money.•    Usability —The experience of trading, sending, and receiving
    money and crypto-assets determines what kind of person can participate in the
    ecosystem. For any given case or type of person, the process of completing a trade
    or transmission has a certain number of steps, and each has a level of difficulty
    or ease. Is this person forced to think? Which concepts does the user interface
    invoke? How long does it take? How much training do they need? Can they show others?
    Each of these elements adds up to the total amount of friction in moving money
    and assets.•    Liquidity —Every asset has a given number of buyers and sellers
    at any price level, which determines how easy it is to buy or sell. For example,
    selling or buying a house takes weeks or months, because it takes work to find
    the people willing to take the other side of the deal. It also takes time to compare
    that deal to other options in the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid,
    but the dynamics are similar. In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for
    another, you have almost no friction because there are so many people selling
    or buying that there is no effort at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the
    most liquid asset in the economy. Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have
    fewer buyers and sellers than fiat currency so that the liquidity still resembles
    that of commodities like foodstuffs or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low
    price or low volume are less liquid, which adds to the system’s friction.You can
    view each source of friction as an entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply
    with or run circles around regulators, you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software
    that automates steps of a trade, or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets
    accessible to new users and open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers
    and sellers “makes a market” and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare
    this ecosystem to the financial markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems
    that crypto-assets can be at least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory
    similar to the internet, which decentralized publishing and communication, while
    matching and then exceeding the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential
    of crypto-assets seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th
    century. There is a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur,
    you can expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset
    and feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an
    opportunity to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek
    to solve a hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer
    base. What are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that
    insiders often discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling
    —how to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private
    transactions —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability
    —how to exchange data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols
    and applications.•    Regulation —who decides who is allowed to do what with which
    crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin
    to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most
    of these critical issues cause friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup,
    they are challenges that require a solution. It is up to the team to build that
    solution as a product or service. Any company that executes well with a fitting
    offer can claim market share from banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will
    lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps,
    off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity,
    making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining
    positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it seems that demand is lacking in
    groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online shoppers, and retail
    shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you an angle of attack
    on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific users of money
    or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your startup into
    a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany
    Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First,
    it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and
    real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins
    become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange,
    that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals
    that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account,
    meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some
    Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’
    the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin
    into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number.
    The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches
    the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price
    of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or
    hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Liquidity and AdoptionThe totality
    of companies and individuals dealing in crypto-assets make up an ecosystem that
    is growing in size and maturity. Markets die without liquidity, so we need to
    grasp how the liquidity of cryptocurrency works. The trading volume grows because
    more people exchange their fiat money for crypto-assets and trade one crypto-asset
    for another. And the number of company relationships grows because each new company
    or market can expand the size and scope of possible deals. Just like in the natural
    world, this ecosystem develops and moves from one phase to the next.For example,
    traders create demand for exchanges, which creates demand for market makers, which
    together create demand for data and software specialists, which creates demand
    for analysts, training courses, and conferences. New crypto-assets can create
    new industries, such as the smart contract that defines a basic token on Ethereum,
    the ERC-20 standard, which gave rise to a boom in token sales, or initial coin
    offerings (ICOs), which in turn created the demand for marketing services. The
    invention of so-called stablecoins—which are tokens pegged to a fiat currency—has
    created a market for borrowing and lending with collateral and leveraged speculation.
    Furthermore, it is now possible to put digital items from online games on a blockchain,
    in the form of a unique token. Gamers and speculators trade these tokenized in-game
    assets on the open market. We can expect that the inventors of new types of assets
    will create other new markets. As an entrepreneur, you fit your mission in this
    maturing ecosystem. In chapter 6, we discuss tokenized holdings in more detail.
    For now, we appreciate these examples as evidence of progress; crypto-assets with
    active users prove that this industry is not just a speculative bubble or a science
    experiment.Even though this technology is in its infancy, we have come a long
    way already. When I discovered Bitcoin, at the beginning of 2013, you needed technical
    expertise to own bitcoins. Also, you needed luck; you could only buy or sell bitcoin
    in some locations, and the only public exchange market for bitcoin was Mt. Gox,
    based in Japan. I wanted to buy some bitcoins as soon as I heard about it, but
    I gave up when I foresaw the hassle of getting my money, Thai baht and euros,
    into a Japanese bank. Furthermore, I was too worried about the security of my
    wallet setup. I felt I had to learn more about wallets before I could trust myself
    to keep bitcoins in the long term. A bit later on, I did a writing job for someone
    who offered to pay in bitcoin, but I declined because I saw no way to spend it.
    These challenges for the liquidity of bitcoins are now over, at least for people
    like me. Handling crypto-assets gets more comfortable with time so that it becomes
    accessible to a broader range of users.The overall growth of these markets for
    crypto-assets has three limiting factors, analogous to physical friction inside
    a mechanical system:•    On-ramp and off-ramp —Trading fiat currency for a crypto-asset
    is similar to a car entering a highway via an on-ramp. The traffic on the road
    is smooth and steady, and the on-ramps and off-ramps are where cars can match
    and adapt their speed to the other traffic. When anyone wants to trade fiat currency
    for a cryptocurrency, it slows down to the speed of fiat. When you use cash, you
    have to meet in person. In case the traders do not know each other, they have
    to build trust or consider risks to personal safety. When you transfer fiat money
    electronically, your trade must comply with your bank’s rules for ‘anti-money
    laundering’ (AML) and ‘know your customer’ (KYC). They tend to force you to limit
    your transaction size and demand explanations of the source of the funds. Regulatory
    authorities require them to do this as a condition for keeping their license to
    transmit money.•    Usability —The experience of trading, sending, and receiving
    money and crypto-assets determines what kind of person can participate in the
    ecosystem. For any given case or type of person, the process of completing a trade
    or transmission has a certain number of steps, and each has a level of difficulty
    or ease. Is this person forced to think? Which concepts does the user interface
    invoke? How long does it take? How much training do they need? Can they show others?
    Each of these elements adds up to the total amount of friction in moving money
    and assets.•    Liquidity —Every asset has a given number of buyers and sellers
    at any price level, which determines how easy it is to buy or sell. For example,
    selling or buying a house takes weeks or months, because it takes work to find
    the people willing to take the other side of the deal. It also takes time to compare
    that deal to other options in the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid,
    but the dynamics are similar. In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for
    another, you have almost no friction because there are so many people selling
    or buying that there is no effort at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the
    most liquid asset in the economy. Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have
    fewer buyers and sellers than fiat currency so that the liquidity still resembles
    that of commodities like foodstuffs or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low
    price or low volume are less liquid, which adds to the system’s friction.You can
    view each source of friction as an entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply
    with or run circles around regulators, you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software
    that automates steps of a trade, or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets
    accessible to new users and open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers
    and sellers “makes a market” and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare
    this ecosystem to the financial markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems
    that crypto-assets can be at least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory
    similar to the internet, which decentralized publishing and communication, while
    matching and then exceeding the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential
    of crypto-assets seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th
    century. There is a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur,
    you can expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset
    and feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an
    opportunity to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek
    to solve a hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer
    base. What are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that
    insiders often discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling
    —how to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private
    transactions —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability
    —how to exchange data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols
    and applications.•    Regulation —who decides who is allowed to do what with which
    crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin
    to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most
    of these critical issues cause friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup,
    they are challenges that require a solution. It is up to the team to build that
    solution as a product or service. Any company that executes well with a fitting
    offer can claim market share from banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will
    lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps,
    off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity,
    making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining
    positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it seems that demand is lacking in
    groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online shoppers, and retail
    shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you an angle of attack
    on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific users of money
    or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your startup into
    a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany
    Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First,
    it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and
    real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins
    become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange,
    that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals
    that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account,
    meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some
    Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’
    the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin
    into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number.
    The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches
    the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price
    of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or
    hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.The totality of companies and individuals
    dealing in crypto-assets make up an ecosystem that is growing in size and maturity.
    Markets die without liquidity, so we need to grasp how the liquidity of cryptocurrency
    works. The trading volume grows because more people exchange their fiat money
    for crypto-assets and trade one crypto-asset for another. And the number of company
    relationships grows because each new company or market can expand the size and
    scope of possible deals. Just like in the natural world, this ecosystem develops
    and moves from one phase to the next.For example, traders create demand for exchanges,
    which creates demand for market makers, which together create demand for data
    and software specialists, which creates demand for analysts, training courses,
    and conferences. New crypto-assets can create new industries, such as the smart
    contract that defines a basic token on Ethereum, the ERC-20 standard, which gave
    rise to a boom in token sales, or initial coin offerings (ICOs), which in turn
    created the demand for marketing services. The invention of so-called stablecoins—which
    are tokens pegged to a fiat currency—has created a market for borrowing and lending
    with collateral and leveraged speculation. Furthermore, it is now possible to
    put digital items from online games on a blockchain, in the form of a unique token.
    Gamers and speculators trade these tokenized in-game assets on the open market.
    We can expect that the inventors of new types of assets will create other new
    markets. As an entrepreneur, you fit your mission in this maturing ecosystem.
    In chapter 6, we discuss tokenized holdings in more detail. For now, we appreciate
    these examples as evidence of progress; crypto-assets with active users prove
    that this industry is not just a speculative bubble or a science experiment.Even
    though this technology is in its infancy, we have come a long way already. When
    I discovered Bitcoin, at the beginning of 2013, you needed technical expertise
    to own bitcoins. Also, you needed luck; you could only buy or sell bitcoin in
    some locations, and the only public exchange market for bitcoin was Mt. Gox, based
    in Japan. I wanted to buy some bitcoins as soon as I heard about it, but I gave
    up when I foresaw the hassle of getting my money, Thai baht and euros, into a
    Japanese bank. Furthermore, I was too worried about the security of my wallet
    setup. I felt I had to learn more about wallets before I could trust myself to
    keep bitcoins in the long term. A bit later on, I did a writing job for someone
    who offered to pay in bitcoin, but I declined because I saw no way to spend it.
    These challenges for the liquidity of bitcoins are now over, at least for people
    like me. Handling crypto-assets gets more comfortable with time so that it becomes
    accessible to a broader range of users.The overall growth of these markets for
    crypto-assets has three limiting factors, analogous to physical friction inside
    a mechanical system:•    On-ramp and off-ramp —Trading fiat currency for a crypto-asset
    is similar to a car entering a highway via an on-ramp. The traffic on the road
    is smooth and steady, and the on-ramps and off-ramps are where cars can match
    and adapt their speed to the other traffic. When anyone wants to trade fiat currency
    for a cryptocurrency, it slows down to the speed of fiat. When you use cash, you
    have to meet in person. In case the traders do not know each other, they have
    to build trust or consider risks to personal safety. When you transfer fiat money
    electronically, your trade must comply with your bank’s rules for ‘anti-money
    laundering’ (AML) and ‘know your customer’ (KYC). They tend to force you to limit
    your transaction size and demand explanations of the source of the funds. Regulatory
    authorities require them to do this as a condition for keeping their license to
    transmit money.•    Usability —The experience of trading, sending, and receiving
    money and crypto-assets determines what kind of person can participate in the
    ecosystem. For any given case or type of person, the process of completing a trade
    or transmission has a certain number of steps, and each has a level of difficulty
    or ease. Is this person forced to think? Which concepts does the user interface
    invoke? How long does it take? How much training do they need? Can they show others?
    Each of these elements adds up to the total amount of friction in moving money
    and assets.•    Liquidity —Every asset has a given number of buyers and sellers
    at any price level, which determines how easy it is to buy or sell. For example,
    selling or buying a house takes weeks or months, because it takes work to find
    the people willing to take the other side of the deal. It also takes time to compare
    that deal to other options in the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid,
    but the dynamics are similar. In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for
    another, you have almost no friction because there are so many people selling
    or buying that there is no effort at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the
    most liquid asset in the economy. Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have
    fewer buyers and sellers than fiat currency so that the liquidity still resembles
    that of commodities like foodstuffs or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low
    price or low volume are less liquid, which adds to the system’s friction.You can
    view each source of friction as an entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply
    with or run circles around regulators, you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software
    that automates steps of a trade, or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets
    accessible to new users and open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers
    and sellers “makes a market” and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare
    this ecosystem to the financial markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems
    that crypto-assets can be at least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory
    similar to the internet, which decentralized publishing and communication, while
    matching and then exceeding the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential
    of crypto-assets seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th
    century. There is a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur,
    you can expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset
    and feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an
    opportunity to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek
    to solve a hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer
    base. What are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that
    insiders often discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling
    —how to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private
    transactions —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability
    —how to exchange data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols
    and applications.•    Regulation —who decides who is allowed to do what with which
    crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin
    to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most
    of these critical issues cause friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup,
    they are challenges that require a solution. It is up to the team to build that
    solution as a product or service. Any company that executes well with a fitting
    offer can claim market share from banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will
    lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps,
    off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity,
    making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining
    positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it seems that demand is lacking in
    groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online shoppers, and retail
    shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you an angle of attack
    on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific users of money
    or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your startup into
    a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany
    Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First,
    it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and
    real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins
    become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange,
    that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals
    that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account,
    meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some
    Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’
    the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin
    into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number.
    The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches
    the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price
    of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or
    hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.For example, traders create demand
    for exchanges, which creates demand for market makers, which together create demand
    for data and software specialists, which creates demand for analysts, training
    courses, and conferences. New crypto-assets can create new industries, such as
    the smart contract that defines a basic token on Ethereum, the ERC-20 standard,
    which gave rise to a boom in token sales, or initial coin offerings (ICOs), which
    in turn created the demand for marketing services. The invention of so-called
    stablecoins—which are tokens pegged to a fiat currency—has created a market for
    borrowing and lending with collateral and leveraged speculation. Furthermore,
    it is now possible to put digital items from online games on a blockchain, in
    the form of a unique token. Gamers and speculators trade these tokenized in-game
    assets on the open market. We can expect that the inventors of new types of assets
    will create other new markets. As an entrepreneur, you fit your mission in this
    maturing ecosystem. In chapter 6, we discuss tokenized holdings in more detail.
    For now, we appreciate these examples as evidence of progress; crypto-assets with
    active users prove that this industry is not just a speculative bubble or a science
    experiment.Even though this technology is in its infancy, we have come a long
    way already. When I discovered Bitcoin, at the beginning of 2013, you needed technical
    expertise to own bitcoins. Also, you needed luck; you could only buy or sell bitcoin
    in some locations, and the only public exchange market for bitcoin was Mt. Gox,
    based in Japan. I wanted to buy some bitcoins as soon as I heard about it, but
    I gave up when I foresaw the hassle of getting my money, Thai baht and euros,
    into a Japanese bank. Furthermore, I was too worried about the security of my
    wallet setup. I felt I had to learn more about wallets before I could trust myself
    to keep bitcoins in the long term. A bit later on, I did a writing job for someone
    who offered to pay in bitcoin, but I declined because I saw no way to spend it.
    These challenges for the liquidity of bitcoins are now over, at least for people
    like me. Handling crypto-assets gets more comfortable with time so that it becomes
    accessible to a broader range of users.The overall growth of these markets for
    crypto-assets has three limiting factors, analogous to physical friction inside
    a mechanical system:•    On-ramp and off-ramp —Trading fiat currency for a crypto-asset
    is similar to a car entering a highway via an on-ramp. The traffic on the road
    is smooth and steady, and the on-ramps and off-ramps are where cars can match
    and adapt their speed to the other traffic. When anyone wants to trade fiat currency
    for a cryptocurrency, it slows down to the speed of fiat. When you use cash, you
    have to meet in person. In case the traders do not know each other, they have
    to build trust or consider risks to personal safety. When you transfer fiat money
    electronically, your trade must comply with your bank’s rules for ‘anti-money
    laundering’ (AML) and ‘know your customer’ (KYC). They tend to force you to limit
    your transaction size and demand explanations of the source of the funds. Regulatory
    authorities require them to do this as a condition for keeping their license to
    transmit money.•    Usability —The experience of trading, sending, and receiving
    money and crypto-assets determines what kind of person can participate in the
    ecosystem. For any given case or type of person, the process of completing a trade
    or transmission has a certain number of steps, and each has a level of difficulty
    or ease. Is this person forced to think? Which concepts does the user interface
    invoke? How long does it take? How much training do they need? Can they show others?
    Each of these elements adds up to the total amount of friction in moving money
    and assets.•    Liquidity —Every asset has a given number of buyers and sellers
    at any price level, which determines how easy it is to buy or sell. For example,
    selling or buying a house takes weeks or months, because it takes work to find
    the people willing to take the other side of the deal. It also takes time to compare
    that deal to other options in the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid,
    but the dynamics are similar. In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for
    another, you have almost no friction because there are so many people selling
    or buying that there is no effort at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the
    most liquid asset in the economy. Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have
    fewer buyers and sellers than fiat currency so that the liquidity still resembles
    that of commodities like foodstuffs or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low
    price or low volume are less liquid, which adds to the system’s friction.You can
    view each source of friction as an entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply
    with or run circles around regulators, you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software
    that automates steps of a trade, or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets
    accessible to new users and open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers
    and sellers “makes a market” and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare
    this ecosystem to the financial markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems
    that crypto-assets can be at least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory
    similar to the internet, which decentralized publishing and communication, while
    matching and then exceeding the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential
    of crypto-assets seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th
    century. There is a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur,
    you can expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset
    and feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an
    opportunity to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek
    to solve a hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer
    base. What are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that
    insiders often discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling
    —how to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private
    transactions —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability
    —how to exchange data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols
    and applications.•    Regulation —who decides who is allowed to do what with which
    crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin
    to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most
    of these critical issues cause friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup,
    they are challenges that require a solution. It is up to the team to build that
    solution as a product or service. Any company that executes well with a fitting
    offer can claim market share from banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will
    lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps,
    off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity,
    making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining
    positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it seems that demand is lacking in
    groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online shoppers, and retail
    shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you an angle of attack
    on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific users of money
    or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your startup into
    a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany
    Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First,
    it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and
    real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins
    become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange,
    that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals
    that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account,
    meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some
    Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’
    the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin
    into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number.
    The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches
    the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price
    of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or
    hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Even though this technology is
    in its infancy, we have come a long way already. When I discovered Bitcoin, at
    the beginning of 2013, you needed technical expertise to own bitcoins. Also, you
    needed luck; you could only buy or sell bitcoin in some locations, and the only
    public exchange market for bitcoin was Mt. Gox, based in Japan. I wanted to buy
    some bitcoins as soon as I heard about it, but I gave up when I foresaw the hassle
    of getting my money, Thai baht and euros, into a Japanese bank. Furthermore, I
    was too worried about the security of my wallet setup. I felt I had to learn more
    about wallets before I could trust myself to keep bitcoins in the long term. A
    bit later on, I did a writing job for someone who offered to pay in bitcoin, but
    I declined because I saw no way to spend it. These challenges for the liquidity
    of bitcoins are now over, at least for people like me. Handling crypto-assets
    gets more comfortable with time so that it becomes accessible to a broader range
    of users.The overall growth of these markets for crypto-assets has three limiting
    factors, analogous to physical friction inside a mechanical system:•    On-ramp
    and off-ramp —Trading fiat currency for a crypto-asset is similar to a car entering
    a highway via an on-ramp. The traffic on the road is smooth and steady, and the
    on-ramps and off-ramps are where cars can match and adapt their speed to the other
    traffic. When anyone wants to trade fiat currency for a cryptocurrency, it slows
    down to the speed of fiat. When you use cash, you have to meet in person. In case
    the traders do not know each other, they have to build trust or consider risks
    to personal safety. When you transfer fiat money electronically, your trade must
    comply with your bank’s rules for ‘anti-money laundering’ (AML) and ‘know your
    customer’ (KYC). They tend to force you to limit your transaction size and demand
    explanations of the source of the funds. Regulatory authorities require them to
    do this as a condition for keeping their license to transmit money.•    Usability
    —The experience of trading, sending, and receiving money and crypto-assets determines
    what kind of person can participate in the ecosystem. For any given case or type
    of person, the process of completing a trade or transmission has a certain number
    of steps, and each has a level of difficulty or ease. Is this person forced to
    think? Which concepts does the user interface invoke? How long does it take? How
    much training do they need? Can they show others? Each of these elements adds
    up to the total amount of friction in moving money and assets.•    Liquidity —Every
    asset has a given number of buyers and sellers at any price level, which determines
    how easy it is to buy or sell. For example, selling or buying a house takes weeks
    or months, because it takes work to find the people willing to take the other
    side of the deal. It also takes time to compare that deal to other options in
    the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid, but the dynamics are similar.
    In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for another, you have almost no
    friction because there are so many people selling or buying that there is no effort
    at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the most liquid asset in the economy.
    Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have fewer buyers and sellers than fiat
    currency so that the liquidity still resembles that of commodities like foodstuffs
    or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low price or low volume are less liquid,
    which adds to the system’s friction.You can view each source of friction as an
    entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply with or run circles around regulators,
    you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software that automates steps of a trade,
    or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets accessible to new users and
    open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers and sellers “makes a market”
    and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare this ecosystem to the financial
    markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems that crypto-assets can be at
    least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory similar to the internet,
    which decentralized publishing and communication, while matching and then exceeding
    the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential of crypto-assets
    seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th century. There is
    a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur, you can
    expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset and
    feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an opportunity
    to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek to solve a
    hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer base. What
    are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that insiders often
    discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling —how
    to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private transactions
    —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability —how to exchange
    data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols and applications.•    Regulation
    —who decides who is allowed to do what with which crypto-assets.•    New applications
    —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate
    governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction
    for users of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a
    solution. It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service.
    Any company that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from
    banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market
    toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract
    new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive.
    The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium
    term, it seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.The overall growth of these markets
    for crypto-assets has three limiting factors, analogous to physical friction inside
    a mechanical system:•    On-ramp and off-ramp —Trading fiat currency for a crypto-asset
    is similar to a car entering a highway via an on-ramp. The traffic on the road
    is smooth and steady, and the on-ramps and off-ramps are where cars can match
    and adapt their speed to the other traffic. When anyone wants to trade fiat currency
    for a cryptocurrency, it slows down to the speed of fiat. When you use cash, you
    have to meet in person. In case the traders do not know each other, they have
    to build trust or consider risks to personal safety. When you transfer fiat money
    electronically, your trade must comply with your bank’s rules for ‘anti-money
    laundering’ (AML) and ‘know your customer’ (KYC). They tend to force you to limit
    your transaction size and demand explanations of the source of the funds. Regulatory
    authorities require them to do this as a condition for keeping their license to
    transmit money.•    Usability —The experience of trading, sending, and receiving
    money and crypto-assets determines what kind of person can participate in the
    ecosystem. For any given case or type of person, the process of completing a trade
    or transmission has a certain number of steps, and each has a level of difficulty
    or ease. Is this person forced to think? Which concepts does the user interface
    invoke? How long does it take? How much training do they need? Can they show others?
    Each of these elements adds up to the total amount of friction in moving money
    and assets.•    Liquidity —Every asset has a given number of buyers and sellers
    at any price level, which determines how easy it is to buy or sell. For example,
    selling or buying a house takes weeks or months, because it takes work to find
    the people willing to take the other side of the deal. It also takes time to compare
    that deal to other options in the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid,
    but the dynamics are similar. In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for
    another, you have almost no friction because there are so many people selling
    or buying that there is no effort at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the
    most liquid asset in the economy. Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have
    fewer buyers and sellers than fiat currency so that the liquidity still resembles
    that of commodities like foodstuffs or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low
    price or low volume are less liquid, which adds to the system’s friction.You can
    view each source of friction as an entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply
    with or run circles around regulators, you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software
    that automates steps of a trade, or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets
    accessible to new users and open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers
    and sellers “makes a market” and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare
    this ecosystem to the financial markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems
    that crypto-assets can be at least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory
    similar to the internet, which decentralized publishing and communication, while
    matching and then exceeding the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential
    of crypto-assets seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th
    century. There is a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur,
    you can expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset
    and feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an
    opportunity to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek
    to solve a hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer
    base. What are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that
    insiders often discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling
    —how to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private
    transactions —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability
    —how to exchange data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols
    and applications.•    Regulation —who decides who is allowed to do what with which
    crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin
    to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most
    of these critical issues cause friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup,
    they are challenges that require a solution. It is up to the team to build that
    solution as a product or service. Any company that executes well with a fitting
    offer can claim market share from banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will
    lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps,
    off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity,
    making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining
    positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it seems that demand is lacking in
    groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online shoppers, and retail
    shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you an angle of attack
    on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific users of money
    or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your startup into
    a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany
    Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First,
    it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and
    real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins
    become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange,
    that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals
    that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account,
    meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some
    Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’
    the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin
    into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number.
    The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches
    the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price
    of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or
    hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    On-ramp and off-ramp —Trading
    fiat currency for a crypto-asset is similar to a car entering a highway via an
    on-ramp. The traffic on the road is smooth and steady, and the on-ramps and off-ramps
    are where cars can match and adapt their speed to the other traffic. When anyone
    wants to trade fiat currency for a cryptocurrency, it slows down to the speed
    of fiat. When you use cash, you have to meet in person. In case the traders do
    not know each other, they have to build trust or consider risks to personal safety.
    When you transfer fiat money electronically, your trade must comply with your
    bank’s rules for ‘anti-money laundering’ (AML) and ‘know your customer’ (KYC).
    They tend to force you to limit your transaction size and demand explanations
    of the source of the funds. Regulatory authorities require them to do this as
    a condition for keeping their license to transmit money.•    Usability —The experience
    of trading, sending, and receiving money and crypto-assets determines what kind
    of person can participate in the ecosystem. For any given case or type of person,
    the process of completing a trade or transmission has a certain number of steps,
    and each has a level of difficulty or ease. Is this person forced to think? Which
    concepts does the user interface invoke? How long does it take? How much training
    do they need? Can they show others? Each of these elements adds up to the total
    amount of friction in moving money and assets.•    Liquidity —Every asset has
    a given number of buyers and sellers at any price level, which determines how
    easy it is to buy or sell. For example, selling or buying a house takes weeks
    or months, because it takes work to find the people willing to take the other
    side of the deal. It also takes time to compare that deal to other options in
    the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid, but the dynamics are similar.
    In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for another, you have almost no
    friction because there are so many people selling or buying that there is no effort
    at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the most liquid asset in the economy.
    Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have fewer buyers and sellers than fiat
    currency so that the liquidity still resembles that of commodities like foodstuffs
    or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low price or low volume are less liquid,
    which adds to the system’s friction.You can view each source of friction as an
    entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply with or run circles around regulators,
    you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software that automates steps of a trade,
    or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets accessible to new users and
    open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers and sellers “makes a market”
    and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare this ecosystem to the financial
    markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems that crypto-assets can be at
    least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory similar to the internet,
    which decentralized publishing and communication, while matching and then exceeding
    the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential of crypto-assets
    seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th century. There is
    a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur, you can
    expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset and
    feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an opportunity
    to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek to solve a
    hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer base. What
    are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that insiders often
    discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling —how
    to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private transactions
    —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability —how to exchange
    data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols and applications.•    Regulation
    —who decides who is allowed to do what with which crypto-assets.•    New applications
    —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate
    governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction
    for users of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a
    solution. It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service.
    Any company that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from
    banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market
    toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract
    new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive.
    The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium
    term, it seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Usability —The experience
    of trading, sending, and receiving money and crypto-assets determines what kind
    of person can participate in the ecosystem. For any given case or type of person,
    the process of completing a trade or transmission has a certain number of steps,
    and each has a level of difficulty or ease. Is this person forced to think? Which
    concepts does the user interface invoke? How long does it take? How much training
    do they need? Can they show others? Each of these elements adds up to the total
    amount of friction in moving money and assets.•    Liquidity —Every asset has
    a given number of buyers and sellers at any price level, which determines how
    easy it is to buy or sell. For example, selling or buying a house takes weeks
    or months, because it takes work to find the people willing to take the other
    side of the deal. It also takes time to compare that deal to other options in
    the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid, but the dynamics are similar.
    In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for another, you have almost no
    friction because there are so many people selling or buying that there is no effort
    at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the most liquid asset in the economy.
    Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have fewer buyers and sellers than fiat
    currency so that the liquidity still resembles that of commodities like foodstuffs
    or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low price or low volume are less liquid,
    which adds to the system’s friction.You can view each source of friction as an
    entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply with or run circles around regulators,
    you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software that automates steps of a trade,
    or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets accessible to new users and
    open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers and sellers “makes a market”
    and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare this ecosystem to the financial
    markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems that crypto-assets can be at
    least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory similar to the internet,
    which decentralized publishing and communication, while matching and then exceeding
    the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential of crypto-assets
    seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th century. There is
    a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur, you can
    expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset and
    feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an opportunity
    to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek to solve a
    hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer base. What
    are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that insiders often
    discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling —how
    to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private transactions
    —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability —how to exchange
    data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols and applications.•    Regulation
    —who decides who is allowed to do what with which crypto-assets.•    New applications
    —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate
    governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction
    for users of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a
    solution. It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service.
    Any company that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from
    banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market
    toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract
    new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive.
    The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium
    term, it seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Liquidity —Every asset has
    a given number of buyers and sellers at any price level, which determines how
    easy it is to buy or sell. For example, selling or buying a house takes weeks
    or months, because it takes work to find the people willing to take the other
    side of the deal. It also takes time to compare that deal to other options in
    the same price range. Cars are a bit more liquid, but the dynamics are similar.
    In contrast, when you trade one fiat currency for another, you have almost no
    friction because there are so many people selling or buying that there is no effort
    at all to find a buyer or seller. Money is the most liquid asset in the economy.
    Cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets have fewer buyers and sellers than fiat
    currency so that the liquidity still resembles that of commodities like foodstuffs
    or metals. Crypto-assets that trade at a low price or low volume are less liquid,
    which adds to the system’s friction.You can view each source of friction as an
    entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply with or run circles around regulators,
    you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software that automates steps of a trade,
    or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets accessible to new users and
    open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers and sellers “makes a market”
    and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare this ecosystem to the financial
    markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems that crypto-assets can be at
    least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory similar to the internet,
    which decentralized publishing and communication, while matching and then exceeding
    the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential of crypto-assets
    seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th century. There is
    a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur, you can
    expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset and
    feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an opportunity
    to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek to solve a
    hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer base. What
    are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that insiders often
    discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling —how
    to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private transactions
    —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability —how to exchange
    data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols and applications.•    Regulation
    —who decides who is allowed to do what with which crypto-assets.•    New applications
    —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate
    governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction
    for users of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a
    solution. It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service.
    Any company that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from
    banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market
    toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract
    new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive.
    The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium
    term, it seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.You can view each source of friction
    as an entrepreneurial challenge. Whether you comply with or run circles around
    regulators, you boost the on-ramp and off-ramp. Software that automates steps
    of a trade, or invokes better metaphors, will make crypto-assets accessible to
    new users and open new markets. Whoever connects pockets of buyers and sellers
    “makes a market” and boosts liquidity for that asset.We can compare this ecosystem
    to the financial markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems that crypto-assets
    can be at least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory similar to the
    internet, which decentralized publishing and communication, while matching and
    then exceeding the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential
    of crypto-assets seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th
    century. There is a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur,
    you can expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset
    and feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an
    opportunity to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek
    to solve a hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer
    base. What are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that
    insiders often discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling
    —how to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private
    transactions —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability
    —how to exchange data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols
    and applications.•    Regulation —who decides who is allowed to do what with which
    crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin
    to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most
    of these critical issues cause friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup,
    they are challenges that require a solution. It is up to the team to build that
    solution as a product or service. Any company that executes well with a fitting
    offer can claim market share from banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will
    lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps,
    off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity,
    making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining
    positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it seems that demand is lacking in
    groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online shoppers, and retail
    shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you an angle of attack
    on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific users of money
    or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your startup into
    a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany
    Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First,
    it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and
    real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins
    become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange,
    that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals
    that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account,
    meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some
    Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’
    the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin
    into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number.
    The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches
    the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price
    of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or
    hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.We can compare this ecosystem to
    the financial markets of the 19th and 20th centuries. It seems that crypto-assets
    can be at least as sophisticated. It could follow a trajectory similar to the
    internet, which decentralized publishing and communication, while matching and
    then exceeding the sophistication of traditional methods. The growth-potential
    of crypto-assets seems to resemble that of the internet at the end of the 20th
    century. There is a lot of work to do and many rewards to reap. As a crypto-entrepreneur,
    you can expect the 2020s to be roaring. Whenever you play around with a crypto-asset
    and feel irritation, boredom, confusion, or frustration, you are looking at an
    opportunity to make a difference and make a crypto-fortune. Entrepreneurs seek
    to solve a hard problem and to deliver the solution to a fast-growing customer
    base. What are the critical issues in the field of crypto-assets? Topics that
    insiders often discuss are:•    Usability —how to make transactions easier.•    Scaling
    —how to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private
    transactions —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability
    —how to exchange data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols
    and applications.•    Regulation —who decides who is allowed to do what with which
    crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin
    to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most
    of these critical issues cause friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup,
    they are challenges that require a solution. It is up to the team to build that
    solution as a product or service. Any company that executes well with a fitting
    offer can claim market share from banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will
    lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps,
    off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity,
    making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining
    positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it seems that demand is lacking in
    groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online shoppers, and retail
    shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you an angle of attack
    on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific users of money
    or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your startup into
    a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany
    Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First,
    it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and
    real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins
    become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange,
    that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals
    that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account,
    meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some
    Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’
    the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin
    into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number.
    The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches
    the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price
    of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or
    hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Usability —how to make transactions
    easier.•    Scaling —how to boost the transaction capacity of a given blockchain
    network.•    Private transactions —what will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability
    —how to exchange data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols
    and applications.•    Regulation —who decides who is allowed to do what with which
    crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin
    to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most
    of these critical issues cause friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup,
    they are challenges that require a solution. It is up to the team to build that
    solution as a product or service. Any company that executes well with a fitting
    offer can claim market share from banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will
    lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps,
    off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity,
    making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining
    positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it seems that demand is lacking in
    groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online shoppers, and retail
    shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you an angle of attack
    on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific users of money
    or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your startup into
    a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany
    Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First,
    it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and
    real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins
    become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange,
    that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals
    that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account,
    meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some
    Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’
    the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin
    into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number.
    The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches
    the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price
    of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or
    hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Scaling —how to boost the
    transaction capacity of a given blockchain network.•    Private transactions —what
    will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability —how to exchange data
    between a specific blockchain and other software protocols and applications.•    Regulation
    —who decides who is allowed to do what with which crypto-assets.•    New applications
    —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate
    governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction
    for users of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a
    solution. It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service.
    Any company that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from
    banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market
    toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract
    new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive.
    The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium
    term, it seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Private transactions —what
    will people do with untraceable money.•    Interoperability —how to exchange data
    between a specific blockchain and other software protocols and applications.•    Regulation
    —who decides who is allowed to do what with which crypto-assets.•    New applications
    —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate
    governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction
    for users of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a
    solution. It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service.
    Any company that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from
    banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market
    toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract
    new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive.
    The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium
    term, it seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Interoperability —how to exchange
    data between a specific blockchain and other software protocols and applications.•    Regulation
    —who decides who is allowed to do what with which crypto-assets.•    New applications
    —how to apply the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate
    governance, politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction
    for users of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a
    solution. It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service.
    Any company that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from
    banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market
    toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract
    new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive.
    The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium
    term, it seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Regulation —who decides who
    is allowed to do what with which crypto-assets.•    New applications —how to apply
    the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance,
    politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction for users
    of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a solution.
    It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service. Any company
    that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from banks. Every
    progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream
    adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets
    of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry
    as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it
    seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    New applications —how to apply
    the insights behind Bitcoin to non-financial fields, such as corporate governance,
    politics, and nonprofits.Most of these critical issues cause friction for users
    of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require a solution.
    It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service. Any company
    that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from banks. Every
    progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market toward mainstream
    adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract new pockets
    of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive. The industry
    as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium term, it
    seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Most of these critical issues cause
    friction for users of crypto-assets. For a startup, they are challenges that require
    a solution. It is up to the team to build that solution as a product or service.
    Any company that executes well with a fitting offer can claim market share from
    banks. Every progress in crypto-assets will lower friction and advance the market
    toward mainstream adoption. Better on-ramps, off-ramps, and user experiences attract
    new pockets of users, which boosts liquidity, making crypto-assets more attractive.
    The industry as a whole is a self-sustaining positive feedback loop.In the medium
    term, it seems that demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment
    funds, online shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book
    will give you an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more
    of them for specific users of money or a financial product, and you have a good
    chance of turning your startup into a thriving company that competes with the
    traditional banks.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress
    through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes
    a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on
    to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the
    second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods
    and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value
    is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices
    of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,”
    which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin
    that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which
    seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this amount for a
    possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes
    a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin is very high.
    When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare for that
    future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a currency
    when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the present,
    Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among those
    that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and
    investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping
    their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside, because
    many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise
    with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise,
    as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend
    it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full
    circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes
    that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use
    of the currency because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete
    circles of transactions are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow
    and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That
    is why companies that exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so
    far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem
    starts on barren soil without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants
    can thrive. The plant matter from these species is the foundation on which other
    species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers
    are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat
    currency still rules. They are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The
    pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect
    those circles. But their current limitation is that they only make markets for
    the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators, or spenders start
    with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners,
    who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency
    as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange.
    The companies that help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most
    successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business
    of most asset exchanges. They win customers when they are good at trading across
    the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat
    debit cards —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend
    is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that means that when you pay for something with
    this card, the company who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset
    in exchange for the fiat currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a
    percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized trades —There are specific markets
    that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing to sell something for
    it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a way to get a substantial
    discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon
    gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid asset to the items they
    can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those who want to purchase items
    at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that exchange. Pulse.io has now
    stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.In the medium term, it seems that
    demand is lacking in groups of potential users, such as investment funds, online
    shoppers, and retail shoppers. The remaining chapters of this book will give you
    an angle of attack on these critical problems. Solve one or more of them for specific
    users of money or a financial product, and you have a good chance of turning your
    startup into a thriving company that competes with the traditional banks.Connecting
    Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages
    of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity that becomes a store of value,
    like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it to hold on to it to protect their
    wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes
    a medium of exchange, that is, a payment method for goods and services. If the
    liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can
    be the unit of account, meaning that people will calculate prices of goods and
    services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation
    of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You
    can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously
    high number. The developers chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin
    reaches the last stage of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world,
    the price of an individual bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant
    or hotel with sats, they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In
    summary, a commodity becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and
    can set a price in it. In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies
    work as payment methods only among those that want it as a store of value. They
    see Bitcoin as a better way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance
    to get more bitcoin. They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure,
    with the add-on benefit of high upside, because many believe that on the medium-
    to long term, the price of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem.
    Companies will spend bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it,
    and their customers can pay them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are
    more likely to want to earn it when you know where to spend it.These activities
    of earning, saving, investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity
    can only grow into the functions of a currency when it completes that circle;
    when there is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency
    because someone else will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions
    are, for now, small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price
    of bitcoin rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that
    exchange crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the
    natural world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil
    without much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant
    matter from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Connecting Crypto-CirclesMany Bitcoiners
    expect Bitcoin to progress through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves
    like a commodity that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate.
    People buy it to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more
    accepted, it reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is,
    a payment method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of
    fiat currencies and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning
    that people will calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners
    already pay bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name
    of the smallest unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into
    a hundred million satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers
    chose this amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage
    of adoption and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual
    bitcoin is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats,
    they prepare for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity
    becomes a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it.
    In the present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods
    only among those that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better
    way of saving and investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin.
    They save it for keeping their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit
    of high upside, because many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price
    of bitcoin will rise with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay
    them with bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn
    it when you know where to spend it.These activities of earning, saving, investing,
    and spending can become a full circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions
    of a currency when it completes that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s
    mind that they can make good use of the currency because someone else will accept
    it as payment. These complete circles of transactions are, for now, small and
    isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which
    boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that exchange crypto-assets
    have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer
    vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil without much nutrition.
    Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant matter from these species
    is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies,
    traders, and market makers are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset
    development because fiat currency still rules. They are the foundation on which
    other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated,
    and exchanges connect those circles. But their current limitation is that they
    only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators,
    or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions
    are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those
    who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy
    is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that help people sell their fiat for
    crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only
    trading is the core business of most asset exchanges. They win customers when
    they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples
    of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards —you get a debit card like
    any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that
    means that when you pay for something with this card, the company who issued the
    card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat currency of
    the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Many Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin
    to progress through three stages of adoption: First, it behaves like a commodity
    that becomes a store of value, like gold, bonds, and real estate. People buy it
    to hold on to it to protect their wealth. As bitcoins become more accepted, it
    reaches the second stage: it becomes a medium of exchange, that is, a payment
    method for goods and services. If the liquidity ever equals that of fiat currencies
    and the value is stable, it can be the unit of account, meaning that people will
    calculate prices of goods and services in bitcoin.Some Bitcoiners already pay
    bills in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest
    unit of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million
    satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this
    amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption
    and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin
    is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare
    for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a
    currency when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the
    present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among
    those that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving
    and investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for
    keeping their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside,
    because many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will
    rise with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other
    cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with
    bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when
    you know where to spend it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and
    spending can become a full circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions
    of a currency when it completes that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s
    mind that they can make good use of the currency because someone else will accept
    it as payment. These complete circles of transactions are, for now, small and
    isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which
    boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that exchange crypto-assets
    have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer
    vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil without much nutrition.
    Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant matter from these species
    is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies,
    traders, and market makers are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset
    development because fiat currency still rules. They are the foundation on which
    other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated,
    and exchanges connect those circles. But their current limitation is that they
    only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators,
    or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions
    are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those
    who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy
    is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that help people sell their fiat for
    crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only
    trading is the core business of most asset exchanges. They win customers when
    they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples
    of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards —you get a debit card like
    any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that
    means that when you pay for something with this card, the company who issued the
    card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat currency of
    the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Some Bitcoiners already pay bills
    in “sats,” which is an abbreviation of ‘satoshis,’ the name of the smallest unit
    of bitcoin that you can send. You can divide a bitcoin into a hundred million
    satoshis, which seems like a ridiculously high number. The developers chose this
    amount for a possible future in which Bitcoin reaches the last stage of adoption
    and becomes a unit of account. In that world, the price of an individual bitcoin
    is very high. When an enthusiast pays a restaurant or hotel with sats, they prepare
    for that future of broad adoption of Bitcoin.In summary, a commodity becomes a
    currency when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the
    present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among
    those that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving
    and investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for
    keeping their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside,
    because many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will
    rise with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other
    cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with
    bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when
    you know where to spend it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and
    spending can become a full circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions
    of a currency when it completes that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s
    mind that they can make good use of the currency because someone else will accept
    it as payment. These complete circles of transactions are, for now, small and
    isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which
    boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that exchange crypto-assets
    have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer
    vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil without much nutrition.
    Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant matter from these species
    is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies,
    traders, and market makers are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset
    development because fiat currency still rules. They are the foundation on which
    other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated,
    and exchanges connect those circles. But their current limitation is that they
    only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators,
    or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions
    are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those
    who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy
    is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that help people sell their fiat for
    crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only
    trading is the core business of most asset exchanges. They win customers when
    they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples
    of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards —you get a debit card like
    any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that
    means that when you pay for something with this card, the company who issued the
    card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat currency of
    the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.In summary, a commodity becomes
    a currency when you can save it, pay with it, and can set a price in it. In the
    present, Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies work as payment methods only among
    those that want it as a store of value. They see Bitcoin as a better way of saving
    and investing, and they welcome the chance to get more bitcoin. They save it for
    keeping their wealth liquid but secure, with the add-on benefit of high upside,
    because many believe that on the medium- to long term, the price of bitcoin will
    rise with the growth of the ecosystem. Companies will spend bitcoin and other
    cryptocurrencies if suppliers accept it, and their customers can pay them with
    bitcoin. Likewise, as a consumer, you are more likely to want to earn it when
    you know where to spend it.These activities of earning, saving, investing, and
    spending can become a full circle. A commodity can only grow into the functions
    of a currency when it completes that circle; when there is no doubt in anyone’s
    mind that they can make good use of the currency because someone else will accept
    it as payment. These complete circles of transactions are, for now, small and
    isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price of bitcoin rises, which
    boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that exchange crypto-assets
    have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the natural world is pioneer
    vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil without much nutrition.
    Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant matter from these species
    is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise, crypto exchange companies,
    traders, and market makers are benefitting from the early stages of crypto-asset
    development because fiat currency still rules. They are the foundation on which
    other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders, and sellers start isolated,
    and exchanges connect those circles. But their current limitation is that they
    only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs. Most traders, speculators,
    or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for crypto-assets. Exceptions
    are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for a cryptocurrency, and those
    who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services. The crypto economy
    is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that help people sell their fiat for
    crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting the circles of crypto-only
    trading is the core business of most asset exchanges. They win customers when
    they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat and crypto-assets. Examples
    of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards —you get a debit card like
    any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency. In practice, that
    means that when you pay for something with this card, the company who issued the
    card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat currency of
    the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.These activities of earning, saving,
    investing, and spending can become a full circle. A commodity can only grow into
    the functions of a currency when it completes that circle; when there is no doubt
    in anyone’s mind that they can make good use of the currency because someone else
    will accept it as payment. These complete circles of transactions are, for now,
    small and isolated. When these circles grow and connect, the price of bitcoin
    rises, which boosts liquidity and demand. That is why companies that exchange
    crypto-assets have been the most profitable so far. The analogy to the natural
    world is pioneer vegetation : A growing ecosystem starts on barren soil without
    much nutrition. Only a select few species of plants can thrive. The plant matter
    from these species is the foundation on which other species can grow. Likewise,
    crypto exchange companies, traders, and market makers are benefitting from the
    early stages of crypto-asset development because fiat currency still rules. They
    are the foundation on which other crypto species grow.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.The pockets of buyers, holders,
    and sellers start isolated, and exchanges connect those circles. But their current
    limitation is that they only make markets for the fiat and crypto-asset pairs.
    Most traders, speculators, or spenders start with exchanging fiat currency for
    crypto-assets. Exceptions are proof-of-work-miners, who exchange electricity for
    a cryptocurrency, and those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and
    services. The crypto economy is a fiat-to-crypto exchange. The companies that
    help people sell their fiat for crypto-assets are the most successful, so connecting
    the circles of crypto-only trading is the core business of most asset exchanges.
    They win customers when they are good at trading across the boundary between fiat
    and crypto-assets. Examples of those companies are:•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Crypto-to-fiat debit cards
    —you get a debit card like any other, except that the asset you spend is a cryptocurrency.
    In practice, that means that when you pay for something with this card, the company
    who issued the card sells a portion of your crypto-asset in exchange for the fiat
    currency of the bill that you just paid. They take a percentage over that transaction.•    Specialized
    trades —There are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency,
    or willing to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io
    offered a way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with
    bitcoin. Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer
    a liquid asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it
    with those who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency
    for that exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Specialized trades —There
    are specific markets that will pay a premium for a cryptocurrency, or willing
    to sell something for it at a discount. For several years, Pulse.io offered a
    way to get a substantial discount on Amazon products if you paid with bitcoin.
    Some people earn Amazon gift certificates as pay or bonuses. They prefer a liquid
    asset to the items they can buy on Amazon, and they need to trade it with those
    who want to purchase items at Amazon. Bitcoin is the perfect currency for that
    exchange. Pulse.io has now stopped operation, but it is a great example.•    New
    payment processors —Entrepreneurs sometimes discover demand for making a specific
    type of payment. A current model is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which
    lets customers pay a webshop with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin.
    This payment bypasses the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice
    versa. Insiders have often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a
    significant step toward driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins
    —Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized
    assets, and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    New payment processors —Entrepreneurs
    sometimes discover demand for making a specific type of payment. A current model
    is Bitcoin wallet company Zap’s application which lets customers pay a webshop
    with fiat currency, while the merchant receives bitcoin. This payment bypasses
    the friction of trading fiat for cryptocurrency and vice versa. Insiders have
    often observed that making cryptocurrency invisible is a significant step toward
    driving adoption, and Zap is an excellent example of that.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum
    and other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets,
    and one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Stablecoins —Ethereum and
    other smart contract blockchains enable the transfer of tokenized assets, and
    one of those assets can be a fiat currency. Another good name is “crypto-dollars.”
    We can expect other tokenized fiat currencies later on. These crypto-assets have
    a stable value like fiat currency, and you can transmit them as cryptocurrency.
    In case the holder wants to limit their exposure to the volatility of crypto-assets,
    buying stablecoins is a way of cashing out. Furthermore, they are no longer dependent
    on exchanges that have to follow ‘Know Your Customer (KYC)’-regulations to offer
    their customers fiat currency.These tantalizing examples show the unexplored ways
    in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.These tantalizing examples show
    the unexplored ways in which we could exchange cryptocurrencies.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis
    friction of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp
    -metaphor, which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people
    used for describing the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to
    describe this process of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming
    a larger closed circle. The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the
    user experience and is, therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example
    of a better metaphor is a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the
    decentralized exchange called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies
    have embraced this metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets.
    An ideal exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto-
    asset, peer-to-peer. This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For
    example, the user only states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software
    handles the trades to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies
    are merchants, who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from
    their customers and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For
    now, at least a portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency.
    Therefore, the desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant.
    Furthermore, some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency.
    While transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing
    need to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Money-Moving MetaphorsThis friction
    of trades across the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor,
    which resembles the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing
    the internet. In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process
    of small, closed circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle.
    The right metaphor will inspire a better design for the user experience and is,
    therefore, an entrepreneurial opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is
    a scanner, a radar, for finding trades. The name of the decentralized exchange
    called “Radar Relay” refers to this. Other exchange companies have embraced this
    metaphor too. However, most of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal
    exchange would allow anyone to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer.
    This exchange would have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only
    states a desired ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades
    to reach these levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants,
    who have currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers
    and have to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a
    portion of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the
    desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore,
    some customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While
    transacting for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need
    to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto
    working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer.
    In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.This friction of trades across
    the boundary is the origin of the clumsy on-ramp - off-ramp -metaphor, which resembles
    the outdated “Information Superhighway” that people used for describing the internet.
    In the future, we need a better metaphor to describe this process of small, closed
    circles of buyers and sellers becoming a larger closed circle. The right metaphor
    will inspire a better design for the user experience and is, therefore, an entrepreneurial
    opportunity. An example of a better metaphor is a scanner, a radar, for finding
    trades. The name of the decentralized exchange called “Radar Relay” refers to
    this. Other exchange companies have embraced this metaphor too. However, most
    of these exchanges only trade crypto-assets. An ideal exchange would allow anyone
    to sell any fiat currency for any crypto- asset, peer-to-peer. This exchange would
    have an automatic user interface. For example, the user only states a desired
    ratio or level for an asset, and the software handles the trades to reach these
    levels.One type of potential trader of cryptocurrencies are merchants, who have
    currency as working capital. Merchants accept money from their customers and have
    to use part of that money to pay their suppliers. For now, at least a portion
    of these suppliers will want to receive fiat currency. Therefore, the desired
    ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency differs per merchant. Furthermore, some
    customers want to hold a portion of their savings in cryptocurrency. While transacting
    for goods and services, merchants and customers have a growing need to rebalance
    their holdings. Ongoing trade requires a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto working
    capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto savings for the customer. In a
    fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this rebalancing does not happen,
    because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary to rebalance; the balance
    is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is part fiat, part crypto, people
    need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat and cryptocurrency, we need
    exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of rebalancing: that is why exchange
    services and stablecoins are in high demand. The exchanges, over-the-counter traders,
    and market makers have been the most profitable crypto companies so far. In a
    future in which most economic ecosystems will only use crypto-assets, exchanges
    will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity across the board and drive adoption,
    we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments in cryptocurrencies
    and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and payers a currency has,
    the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency. For any money
    to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because of the economic
    force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange goods and other
    currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone who will
    accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.One type of potential trader of
    cryptocurrencies are merchants, who have currency as working capital. Merchants
    accept money from their customers and have to use part of that money to pay their
    suppliers. For now, at least a portion of these suppliers will want to receive
    fiat currency. Therefore, the desired ratio of crypto-assets and fiat currency
    differs per merchant. Furthermore, some customers want to hold a portion of their
    savings in cryptocurrency. While transacting for goods and services, merchants
    and customers have a growing need to rebalance their holdings. Ongoing trade requires
    a rebalancing of fiat-versus-crypto working capital for the merchant and fiat-versus-crypto
    savings for the customer. In a fiat-only economy, or a crypto-only economy, this
    rebalancing does not happen, because no fiat-to-crypto transactions are necessary
    to rebalance; the balance is always perfect.Conversely, in an economy that is
    part fiat, part crypto, people need to rebalance. As long as the economy has fiat
    and cryptocurrency, we need exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction of
    rebalancing: that is why exchange services and stablecoins are in high demand.
    The exchanges, over-the-counter traders, and market makers have been the most
    profitable crypto companies so far. In a future in which most economic ecosystems
    will only use crypto-assets, exchanges will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity
    across the board and drive adoption, we need customers and merchants to make and
    accept payments in cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets. The more holders,
    accepters, and payers a currency has, the more sense it makes to hold, take, and
    spend that currency. For any money to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency
    becomes liquid because of the economic force of the nation-state that issues it.
    The more people exchange goods and other currencies for a nation’s currency, the
    easier it is to find someone who will accept that currency as payment. A network
    of traders develops for exchanging large amounts of this currency so that no single
    trade of this currency can move the price; the market is so large that it can
    absorb shocks in supply and demand. In contrast, smaller markets, such as for
    an individual stock, are sensitive to changes in demand and supply. A portion
    of buyers and sellers can make large trades of that stock, which moves the price
    up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The liquidity of fiat currency is a
    desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the more stable the price. People
    who save for the short term hold a cash position to prepare for unknown circumstances
    in their company or personal life. Cash has the function of storing value when
    your future is uncertain; you get ready for risk and uncertainty by holding cash.
    People and companies that hold money want the value of the currency to be as stable
    as possible.The potential of Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency comes from its
    technical features, which could transcend the status of a commodity and become
    money. The technical features give the digital commodity advantages that motivate
    the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it as money. As the isolated pockets connect
    into a closed-loop, they realize more of that monetary potential. The mechanisms
    that transform a commodity into money are visible as network effects. According
    to Investopedia:The network effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of
    people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The internet is
    an example of a network effect. Initially, there were few internet users since
    it was of little importance to anyone outside of the military and some research
    scientists. However, as more users gained access to the internet, they produced
    more content, information, and services. The development and improvement of websites
    attracted more users to connect and do business with each other. As the internet
    experienced increases in traffic, it offered more value, leading to a network
    effect.A commodity can only become a currency when a large number of people agree
    that it has value. The usefulness as money can grow beyond the original value
    as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price has two parts: the value as
    a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The features and advantages of Bitcoin
    make its network effects hard to beat. Think about how easy or hard you find it
    to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared to altcoins, it is quite easy to
    find someone to trade bitcoin, because there are so many more people who agree
    that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic results in an iron dominance for
    the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance
    with features that are so attractive that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network
    effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies
    challenge Bitcoin all the time, so it has to stay better than the competition
    or become a relic. The digital scarcity does not only refer to the individual
    BTC tokens but also to the strength of the network effect itself. Establishing
    a new currency is so complicated that the first cryptocurrency that is good enough,
    BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted widely. Scarcity is not just limited
    supply; the market has to demand the asset more than it has demand for other assets
    that resemble it. It seems that the advantage of Bitcoin is substantial because
    the network effects of money are even more robust than those of, for example,
    audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or a piece of software-as-a-service.
    Although you could come up with a system that is better than Bitcoin in some dimension,
    this contender has to overcome all the advantages of existing liquidity, brand
    recognition, security, and community that the Bitcoin network has acquired. For
    the foreseeable future, the odds are against that.Other cryptocurrencies can still
    succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches left open by Bitcoin. Then the success
    of these alternatives depends on the technical limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies.
    For example, people have different opinions on scaling the network’s capacity,
    or the trade-off between privacy and ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm.
    Each of these viewpoints has led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave
    a boost to the conversation about a digital currency, and many people have become
    excited about creating new kinds of money. The game of money and finance is now
    an open field in which free players can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies
    that rely on a cryptocurrency do expand the network so that growth begets growth.
    The positive feedback loop can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives
    are aligned. When each of the players in the ecosystem wants what another has,
    trading volume grows. To understand the motives of these people and see what makes
    them move a crypto-asset around, we can look at them through the lens of a buyer
    persona : an idealized and simplified type of customer, with a story that explains
    their motives and incentives. Software companies often clarify their thinking
    about their market by brainstorming these buyer personas, giving them a name,
    and then imagine that this person is using their software. We will look at these
    buyer personas for crypto-assets because friction in software for crypto-assets
    is always about interacting with technology. Before we discuss the technology
    in the following chapters, we first have to know the types of people who will
    use the hardware and software.At this stage, your customer is an innovator or
    early adopter. They want your crypto product to get an edge, and it has to do
    with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona of users of cryptocurrencies
    in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That is why we have to define
    these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset: earning, saving, investing,
    speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou can earn a crypto-asset when
    you sell a product, service, or labor to someone willing to part with that crypto-asset.
    In case the asset is liquid enough, with a somewhat stable price in fiat currency,
    it will be easy to overcome the friction in the trade. That is because you no
    longer have to buy this asset anymore with fiat currency. You will have to make
    a transaction with someone who owns it and is also open to selling. That person
    also has to want to become your customer, client, or employer. We can expect a
    future in which most earnings of crypto-assets are cryptocurrencies, as these
    have qualities that can make them the most liquid; they are designed to be earned
    in the first place. As of the time of writing in 2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies
    makes the most sense in the following cases:•    Location-independent companies
    with founders and employees across the globe, living in and traveling to multiple
    jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking system, paying these teams is an ordeal.
    Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive and time-consuming. You can pay everyone
    in cryptocurrency because team members can sell their cryptocurrency locally.
    That trade is more natural than to have the company change whatever currency they
    hold into the fiat currency of a specific team member’s country of residence.•    Companies
    that want to attract new customers by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders
    look for opportunities to spend as a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending
    of their holdings saves them the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners
    of companies that want to hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or
    service; they only have to sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency,
    and they hold on to the crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable
    payments and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you
    raise funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell
    gray-area or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as
    nation-state actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to
    stop the incoming transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In
    theory, that means that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force.
    In practice, any blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have
    that strength.•    Private black-market deals for some illegal goods that you
    can sell online. This is an arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market
    sellers. Some cryptocurrencies keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement
    agencies analyze blockchains and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive
    payments for hosting services, pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good
    or service you might want to keep private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your
    bank or credit card statement. Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment
    provider for consuming these products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially,
    avoidance becomes easier if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They
    sit there, at a pseudonymous address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or
    laundered. In case owners are willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can
    take a chance at avoiding taxes. They have plausible deniability until they move
    that money to another place that is connected to their identity. Naturally, they
    will delay that connection to their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems,
    parties and amounts in transactions are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially
    by the tax authorities. Although I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people
    for whom cryptocurrency is a piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce
    in low-trust societies is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot
    accept credit card payments because the odds are high that the credit card is
    stolen, and the credit card company will reverse the transactions. They can not
    accept PayPal because these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept
    the burden of proof that they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also
    apply to low-trust industries with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and
    pornography. In a low-trust relationship, online purchases are only possible for
    buyers who are willing to pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the
    buyer or a third party. The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is
    final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee
    that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source
    of friction is your payment system. When you sell products through a webshop,
    you have to automate acceptance of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The
    software that handles these payments has to fit the needs of the trading parties.
    This market for payment solutions is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies,
    and the people that trade them, both change quickly. There are a few significant
    players in this market, but there is no guarantee that they can keep their position.
    Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial technology can look for an
    opening to enter this growing market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency
    is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such
    as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale
    system. Besides, the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate,
    that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction
    of spending because the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate
    the gains you can make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings.
    Then you weigh that against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on.
    When you spend fiat, such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets,
    saving and spending are more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing,
    and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing
    power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,”
    are assuming others want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future
    because it will be the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment
    or investment.The saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific
    “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it
    is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But
    now you have the option to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings
    in new ways. With personal cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer
    and more natural for some people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details
    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Conversely, in an economy that
    is part fiat, part crypto, people need to rebalance. As long as the economy has
    fiat and cryptocurrency, we need exchanges and stablecoins to handle the friction
    of rebalancing: that is why exchange services and stablecoins are in high demand.
    The exchanges, over-the-counter traders, and market makers have been the most
    profitable crypto companies so far. In a future in which most economic ecosystems
    will only use crypto-assets, exchanges will earn smaller margins.To boost liquidity
    across the board and drive adoption, we need customers and merchants to make and
    accept payments in cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets. The more holders,
    accepters, and payers a currency has, the more sense it makes to hold, take, and
    spend that currency. For any money to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency
    becomes liquid because of the economic force of the nation-state that issues it.
    The more people exchange goods and other currencies for a nation’s currency, the
    easier it is to find someone who will accept that currency as payment. A network
    of traders develops for exchanging large amounts of this currency so that no single
    trade of this currency can move the price; the market is so large that it can
    absorb shocks in supply and demand. In contrast, smaller markets, such as for
    an individual stock, are sensitive to changes in demand and supply. A portion
    of buyers and sellers can make large trades of that stock, which moves the price
    up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The liquidity of fiat currency is a
    desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the more stable the price. People
    who save for the short term hold a cash position to prepare for unknown circumstances
    in their company or personal life. Cash has the function of storing value when
    your future is uncertain; you get ready for risk and uncertainty by holding cash.
    People and companies that hold money want the value of the currency to be as stable
    as possible.The potential of Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency comes from its
    technical features, which could transcend the status of a commodity and become
    money. The technical features give the digital commodity advantages that motivate
    the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it as money. As the isolated pockets connect
    into a closed-loop, they realize more of that monetary potential. The mechanisms
    that transform a commodity into money are visible as network effects. According
    to Investopedia:The network effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of
    people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The internet is
    an example of a network effect. Initially, there were few internet users since
    it was of little importance to anyone outside of the military and some research
    scientists. However, as more users gained access to the internet, they produced
    more content, information, and services. The development and improvement of websites
    attracted more users to connect and do business with each other. As the internet
    experienced increases in traffic, it offered more value, leading to a network
    effect.A commodity can only become a currency when a large number of people agree
    that it has value. The usefulness as money can grow beyond the original value
    as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price has two parts: the value as
    a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The features and advantages of Bitcoin
    make its network effects hard to beat. Think about how easy or hard you find it
    to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared to altcoins, it is quite easy to
    find someone to trade bitcoin, because there are so many more people who agree
    that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic results in an iron dominance for
    the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance
    with features that are so attractive that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network
    effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies
    challenge Bitcoin all the time, so it has to stay better than the competition
    or become a relic. The digital scarcity does not only refer to the individual
    BTC tokens but also to the strength of the network effect itself. Establishing
    a new currency is so complicated that the first cryptocurrency that is good enough,
    BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted widely. Scarcity is not just limited
    supply; the market has to demand the asset more than it has demand for other assets
    that resemble it. It seems that the advantage of Bitcoin is substantial because
    the network effects of money are even more robust than those of, for example,
    audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or a piece of software-as-a-service.
    Although you could come up with a system that is better than Bitcoin in some dimension,
    this contender has to overcome all the advantages of existing liquidity, brand
    recognition, security, and community that the Bitcoin network has acquired. For
    the foreseeable future, the odds are against that.Other cryptocurrencies can still
    succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches left open by Bitcoin. Then the success
    of these alternatives depends on the technical limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies.
    For example, people have different opinions on scaling the network’s capacity,
    or the trade-off between privacy and ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm.
    Each of these viewpoints has led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave
    a boost to the conversation about a digital currency, and many people have become
    excited about creating new kinds of money. The game of money and finance is now
    an open field in which free players can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies
    that rely on a cryptocurrency do expand the network so that growth begets growth.
    The positive feedback loop can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives
    are aligned. When each of the players in the ecosystem wants what another has,
    trading volume grows. To understand the motives of these people and see what makes
    them move a crypto-asset around, we can look at them through the lens of a buyer
    persona : an idealized and simplified type of customer, with a story that explains
    their motives and incentives. Software companies often clarify their thinking
    about their market by brainstorming these buyer personas, giving them a name,
    and then imagine that this person is using their software. We will look at these
    buyer personas for crypto-assets because friction in software for crypto-assets
    is always about interacting with technology. Before we discuss the technology
    in the following chapters, we first have to know the types of people who will
    use the hardware and software.At this stage, your customer is an innovator or
    early adopter. They want your crypto product to get an edge, and it has to do
    with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona of users of cryptocurrencies
    in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That is why we have to define
    these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset: earning, saving, investing,
    speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou can earn a crypto-asset when
    you sell a product, service, or labor to someone willing to part with that crypto-asset.
    In case the asset is liquid enough, with a somewhat stable price in fiat currency,
    it will be easy to overcome the friction in the trade. That is because you no
    longer have to buy this asset anymore with fiat currency. You will have to make
    a transaction with someone who owns it and is also open to selling. That person
    also has to want to become your customer, client, or employer. We can expect a
    future in which most earnings of crypto-assets are cryptocurrencies, as these
    have qualities that can make them the most liquid; they are designed to be earned
    in the first place. As of the time of writing in 2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies
    makes the most sense in the following cases:•    Location-independent companies
    with founders and employees across the globe, living in and traveling to multiple
    jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking system, paying these teams is an ordeal.
    Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive and time-consuming. You can pay everyone
    in cryptocurrency because team members can sell their cryptocurrency locally.
    That trade is more natural than to have the company change whatever currency they
    hold into the fiat currency of a specific team member’s country of residence.•    Companies
    that want to attract new customers by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders
    look for opportunities to spend as a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending
    of their holdings saves them the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners
    of companies that want to hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or
    service; they only have to sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency,
    and they hold on to the crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable
    payments and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you
    raise funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell
    gray-area or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as
    nation-state actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to
    stop the incoming transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In
    theory, that means that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force.
    In practice, any blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have
    that strength.•    Private black-market deals for some illegal goods that you
    can sell online. This is an arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market
    sellers. Some cryptocurrencies keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement
    agencies analyze blockchains and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive
    payments for hosting services, pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good
    or service you might want to keep private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your
    bank or credit card statement. Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment
    provider for consuming these products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially,
    avoidance becomes easier if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They
    sit there, at a pseudonymous address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or
    laundered. In case owners are willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can
    take a chance at avoiding taxes. They have plausible deniability until they move
    that money to another place that is connected to their identity. Naturally, they
    will delay that connection to their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems,
    parties and amounts in transactions are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially
    by the tax authorities. Although I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people
    for whom cryptocurrency is a piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce
    in low-trust societies is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot
    accept credit card payments because the odds are high that the credit card is
    stolen, and the credit card company will reverse the transactions. They can not
    accept PayPal because these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept
    the burden of proof that they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also
    apply to low-trust industries with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and
    pornography. In a low-trust relationship, online purchases are only possible for
    buyers who are willing to pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the
    buyer or a third party. The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is
    final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee
    that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source
    of friction is your payment system. When you sell products through a webshop,
    you have to automate acceptance of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The
    software that handles these payments has to fit the needs of the trading parties.
    This market for payment solutions is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies,
    and the people that trade them, both change quickly. There are a few significant
    players in this market, but there is no guarantee that they can keep their position.
    Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial technology can look for an
    opening to enter this growing market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency
    is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such
    as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale
    system. Besides, the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate,
    that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction
    of spending because the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate
    the gains you can make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings.
    Then you weigh that against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on.
    When you spend fiat, such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets,
    saving and spending are more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing,
    and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing
    power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,”
    are assuming others want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future
    because it will be the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment
    or investment.The saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific
    “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it
    is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But
    now you have the option to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings
    in new ways. With personal cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer
    and more natural for some people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details
    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.To boost liquidity across the board
    and drive adoption, we need customers and merchants to make and accept payments
    in cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets. The more holders, accepters, and
    payers a currency has, the more sense it makes to hold, take, and spend that currency.
    For any money to succeed, it must be liquid. Fiat currency becomes liquid because
    of the economic force of the nation-state that issues it. The more people exchange
    goods and other currencies for a nation’s currency, the easier it is to find someone
    who will accept that currency as payment. A network of traders develops for exchanging
    large amounts of this currency so that no single trade of this currency can move
    the price; the market is so large that it can absorb shocks in supply and demand.
    In contrast, smaller markets, such as for an individual stock, are sensitive to
    changes in demand and supply. A portion of buyers and sellers can make large trades
    of that stock, which moves the price up or down more quickly than fiat currency.The
    liquidity of fiat currency is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the
    more stable the price. People who save for the short term hold a cash position
    to prepare for unknown circumstances in their company or personal life. Cash has
    the function of storing value when your future is uncertain; you get ready for
    risk and uncertainty by holding cash. People and companies that hold money want
    the value of the currency to be as stable as possible.The potential of Bitcoin
    and any other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.The liquidity of fiat currency
    is a desirable quality: the more liquid an asset, the more stable the price. People
    who save for the short term hold a cash position to prepare for unknown circumstances
    in their company or personal life. Cash has the function of storing value when
    your future is uncertain; you get ready for risk and uncertainty by holding cash.
    People and companies that hold money want the value of the currency to be as stable
    as possible.The potential of Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency comes from its
    technical features, which could transcend the status of a commodity and become
    money. The technical features give the digital commodity advantages that motivate
    the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it as money. As the isolated pockets connect
    into a closed-loop, they realize more of that monetary potential. The mechanisms
    that transform a commodity into money are visible as network effects. According
    to Investopedia:The network effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of
    people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The internet is
    an example of a network effect. Initially, there were few internet users since
    it was of little importance to anyone outside of the military and some research
    scientists. However, as more users gained access to the internet, they produced
    more content, information, and services. The development and improvement of websites
    attracted more users to connect and do business with each other. As the internet
    experienced increases in traffic, it offered more value, leading to a network
    effect.A commodity can only become a currency when a large number of people agree
    that it has value. The usefulness as money can grow beyond the original value
    as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price has two parts: the value as
    a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The features and advantages of Bitcoin
    make its network effects hard to beat. Think about how easy or hard you find it
    to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared to altcoins, it is quite easy to
    find someone to trade bitcoin, because there are so many more people who agree
    that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic results in an iron dominance for
    the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance
    with features that are so attractive that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network
    effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies
    challenge Bitcoin all the time, so it has to stay better than the competition
    or become a relic. The digital scarcity does not only refer to the individual
    BTC tokens but also to the strength of the network effect itself. Establishing
    a new currency is so complicated that the first cryptocurrency that is good enough,
    BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted widely. Scarcity is not just limited
    supply; the market has to demand the asset more than it has demand for other assets
    that resemble it. It seems that the advantage of Bitcoin is substantial because
    the network effects of money are even more robust than those of, for example,
    audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or a piece of software-as-a-service.
    Although you could come up with a system that is better than Bitcoin in some dimension,
    this contender has to overcome all the advantages of existing liquidity, brand
    recognition, security, and community that the Bitcoin network has acquired. For
    the foreseeable future, the odds are against that.Other cryptocurrencies can still
    succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches left open by Bitcoin. Then the success
    of these alternatives depends on the technical limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies.
    For example, people have different opinions on scaling the network’s capacity,
    or the trade-off between privacy and ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm.
    Each of these viewpoints has led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave
    a boost to the conversation about a digital currency, and many people have become
    excited about creating new kinds of money. The game of money and finance is now
    an open field in which free players can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies
    that rely on a cryptocurrency do expand the network so that growth begets growth.
    The positive feedback loop can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives
    are aligned. When each of the players in the ecosystem wants what another has,
    trading volume grows. To understand the motives of these people and see what makes
    them move a crypto-asset around, we can look at them through the lens of a buyer
    persona : an idealized and simplified type of customer, with a story that explains
    their motives and incentives. Software companies often clarify their thinking
    about their market by brainstorming these buyer personas, giving them a name,
    and then imagine that this person is using their software. We will look at these
    buyer personas for crypto-assets because friction in software for crypto-assets
    is always about interacting with technology. Before we discuss the technology
    in the following chapters, we first have to know the types of people who will
    use the hardware and software.At this stage, your customer is an innovator or
    early adopter. They want your crypto product to get an edge, and it has to do
    with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona of users of cryptocurrencies
    in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That is why we have to define
    these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset: earning, saving, investing,
    speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou can earn a crypto-asset when
    you sell a product, service, or labor to someone willing to part with that crypto-asset.
    In case the asset is liquid enough, with a somewhat stable price in fiat currency,
    it will be easy to overcome the friction in the trade. That is because you no
    longer have to buy this asset anymore with fiat currency. You will have to make
    a transaction with someone who owns it and is also open to selling. That person
    also has to want to become your customer, client, or employer. We can expect a
    future in which most earnings of crypto-assets are cryptocurrencies, as these
    have qualities that can make them the most liquid; they are designed to be earned
    in the first place. As of the time of writing in 2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies
    makes the most sense in the following cases:•    Location-independent companies
    with founders and employees across the globe, living in and traveling to multiple
    jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking system, paying these teams is an ordeal.
    Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive and time-consuming. You can pay everyone
    in cryptocurrency because team members can sell their cryptocurrency locally.
    That trade is more natural than to have the company change whatever currency they
    hold into the fiat currency of a specific team member’s country of residence.•    Companies
    that want to attract new customers by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders
    look for opportunities to spend as a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending
    of their holdings saves them the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners
    of companies that want to hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or
    service; they only have to sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency,
    and they hold on to the crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable
    payments and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you
    raise funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell
    gray-area or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as
    nation-state actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to
    stop the incoming transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In
    theory, that means that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force.
    In practice, any blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have
    that strength.•    Private black-market deals for some illegal goods that you
    can sell online. This is an arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market
    sellers. Some cryptocurrencies keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement
    agencies analyze blockchains and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive
    payments for hosting services, pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good
    or service you might want to keep private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your
    bank or credit card statement. Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment
    provider for consuming these products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially,
    avoidance becomes easier if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They
    sit there, at a pseudonymous address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or
    laundered. In case owners are willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can
    take a chance at avoiding taxes. They have plausible deniability until they move
    that money to another place that is connected to their identity. Naturally, they
    will delay that connection to their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems,
    parties and amounts in transactions are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially
    by the tax authorities. Although I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people
    for whom cryptocurrency is a piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce
    in low-trust societies is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot
    accept credit card payments because the odds are high that the credit card is
    stolen, and the credit card company will reverse the transactions. They can not
    accept PayPal because these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept
    the burden of proof that they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also
    apply to low-trust industries with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and
    pornography. In a low-trust relationship, online purchases are only possible for
    buyers who are willing to pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the
    buyer or a third party. The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is
    final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee
    that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source
    of friction is your payment system. When you sell products through a webshop,
    you have to automate acceptance of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The
    software that handles these payments has to fit the needs of the trading parties.
    This market for payment solutions is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies,
    and the people that trade them, both change quickly. There are a few significant
    players in this market, but there is no guarantee that they can keep their position.
    Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial technology can look for an
    opening to enter this growing market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency
    is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such
    as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale
    system. Besides, the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate,
    that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction
    of spending because the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate
    the gains you can make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings.
    Then you weigh that against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on.
    When you spend fiat, such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets,
    saving and spending are more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing,
    and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing
    power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,”
    are assuming others want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future
    because it will be the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment
    or investment.The saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific
    “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it
    is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But
    now you have the option to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings
    in new ways. With personal cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer
    and more natural for some people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details
    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.The potential of Bitcoin and any
    other cryptocurrency comes from its technical features, which could transcend
    the status of a commodity and become money. The technical features give the digital
    commodity advantages that motivate the pockets of buyers to hold and spend it
    as money. As the isolated pockets connect into a closed-loop, they realize more
    of that monetary potential. The mechanisms that transform a commodity into money
    are visible as network effects. According to Investopedia:The network effect is
    a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value
    of a good or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially,
    there were few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside
    of the military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access
    to the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.The network effect is a phenomenon
    whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good
    or service. The internet is an example of a network effect. Initially, there were
    few internet users since it was of little importance to anyone outside of the
    military and some research scientists. However, as more users gained access to
    the internet, they produced more content, information, and services. The development
    and improvement of websites attracted more users to connect and do business with
    each other. As the internet experienced increases in traffic, it offered more
    value, leading to a network effect.A commodity can only become a currency when
    a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money can
    grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s price
    has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit. The
    features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat. Think
    about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset. Compared
    to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because there
    are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive logic
    results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.A commodity can only become a currency
    when a large number of people agree that it has value. The usefulness as money
    can grow beyond the original value as a commodity product. Then, the commodity’s
    price has two parts: the value as a commodity and the value as a monetary unit.
    The features and advantages of Bitcoin make its network effects hard to beat.
    Think about how easy or hard you find it to buy or sell a given crypto-asset.
    Compared to altcoins, it is quite easy to find someone to trade bitcoin, because
    there are so many more people who agree that bitcoin is useful. This recursive
    logic results in an iron dominance for the first cryptocurrency.Other crypto-assets
    can try to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive
    that they can overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance
    on autopilot. Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so
    it has to stay better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity
    does not only refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the
    network effect itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the
    first cryptocurrency that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted
    widely. Scarcity is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset
    more than it has demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage
    of Bitcoin is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust
    than those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or
    a piece of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that
    is better than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the
    advantages of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that
    the Bitcoin network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against
    that.Other cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches
    left open by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical
    limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different
    opinions on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and
    ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has
    led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about
    a digital currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds
    of money. The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players
    can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency
    do expand the network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop
    can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the
    players in the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand
    the motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around,
    we can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Other crypto-assets can try to
    challenge Bitcoin’s dominance with features that are so attractive that they can
    overcome Bitcoin’s network effects. Bitcoin does not keep its dominance on autopilot.
    Up-and-coming cryptocurrencies challenge Bitcoin all the time, so it has to stay
    better than the competition or become a relic. The digital scarcity does not only
    refer to the individual BTC tokens but also to the strength of the network effect
    itself. Establishing a new currency is so complicated that the first cryptocurrency
    that is good enough, BTC, is also scarce because it is accepted widely. Scarcity
    is not just limited supply; the market has to demand the asset more than it has
    demand for other assets that resemble it. It seems that the advantage of Bitcoin
    is substantial because the network effects of money are even more robust than
    those of, for example, audio carriers such as compact discs and tapes, or a piece
    of software-as-a-service. Although you could come up with a system that is better
    than Bitcoin in some dimension, this contender has to overcome all the advantages
    of existing liquidity, brand recognition, security, and community that the Bitcoin
    network has acquired. For the foreseeable future, the odds are against that.Other
    cryptocurrencies can still succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches left open
    by Bitcoin. Then the success of these alternatives depends on the technical limitations
    of the dominant cryptocurrencies. For example, people have different opinions
    on scaling the network’s capacity, or the trade-off between privacy and ease of
    auditing, or on the consensus algorithm. Each of these viewpoints has led people
    to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave a boost to the conversation about a digital
    currency, and many people have become excited about creating new kinds of money.
    The game of money and finance is now an open field in which free players can compete.The
    Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies that rely on a cryptocurrency do expand the
    network so that growth begets growth. The positive feedback loop can snowball
    into an avalanche when the incentives are aligned. When each of the players in
    the ecosystem wants what another has, trading volume grows. To understand the
    motives of these people and see what makes them move a crypto-asset around, we
    can look at them through the lens of a buyer persona : an idealized and simplified
    type of customer, with a story that explains their motives and incentives. Software
    companies often clarify their thinking about their market by brainstorming these
    buyer personas, giving them a name, and then imagine that this person is using
    their software. We will look at these buyer personas for crypto-assets because
    friction in software for crypto-assets is always about interacting with technology.
    Before we discuss the technology in the following chapters, we first have to know
    the types of people who will use the hardware and software.At this stage, your
    customer is an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get
    an edge, and it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona
    of users of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That
    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:
    earning, saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou
    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,

    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they

    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the

    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Other cryptocurrencies can still
    succeed in the ecosystem by aiming at niches left open by Bitcoin. Then the success
    of these alternatives depends on the technical limitations of the dominant cryptocurrencies.
    For example, people have different opinions on scaling the network’s capacity,
    or the trade-off between privacy and ease of auditing, or on the consensus algorithm.
    Each of these viewpoints has led people to launch more altcoins. Bitcoin gave
    a boost to the conversation about a digital currency, and many people have become
    excited about creating new kinds of money. The game of money and finance is now
    an open field in which free players can compete.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies
    that rely on a cryptocurrency do expand the network so that growth begets growth.
    The positive feedback loop can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives
    are aligned. When each of the players in the ecosystem wants what another has,
    trading volume grows. To understand the motives of these people and see what makes
    them move a crypto-asset around, we can look at them through the lens of a buyer
    persona : an idealized and simplified type of customer, with a story that explains
    their motives and incentives. Software companies often clarify their thinking
    about their market by brainstorming these buyer personas, giving them a name,
    and then imagine that this person is using their software. We will look at these
    buyer personas for crypto-assets because friction in software for crypto-assets
    is always about interacting with technology. Before we discuss the technology
    in the following chapters, we first have to know the types of people who will
    use the hardware and software.At this stage, your customer is an innovator or
    early adopter. They want your crypto product to get an edge, and it has to do
    with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona of users of cryptocurrencies
    in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That is why we have to define
    these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset: earning, saving, investing,
    speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou can earn a crypto-asset when
    you sell a product, service, or labor to someone willing to part with that crypto-asset.
    In case the asset is liquid enough, with a somewhat stable price in fiat currency,
    it will be easy to overcome the friction in the trade. That is because you no
    longer have to buy this asset anymore with fiat currency. You will have to make
    a transaction with someone who owns it and is also open to selling. That person
    also has to want to become your customer, client, or employer. We can expect a
    future in which most earnings of crypto-assets are cryptocurrencies, as these
    have qualities that can make them the most liquid; they are designed to be earned
    in the first place. As of the time of writing in 2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies
    makes the most sense in the following cases:•    Location-independent companies
    with founders and employees across the globe, living in and traveling to multiple
    jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking system, paying these teams is an ordeal.
    Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive and time-consuming. You can pay everyone
    in cryptocurrency because team members can sell their cryptocurrency locally.
    That trade is more natural than to have the company change whatever currency they
    hold into the fiat currency of a specific team member’s country of residence.•    Companies
    that want to attract new customers by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders
    look for opportunities to spend as a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending
    of their holdings saves them the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners
    of companies that want to hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or
    service; they only have to sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency,
    and they hold on to the crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable
    payments and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you
    raise funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell
    gray-area or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as
    nation-state actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to
    stop the incoming transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In
    theory, that means that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force.
    In practice, any blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have
    that strength.•    Private black-market deals for some illegal goods that you
    can sell online. This is an arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market
    sellers. Some cryptocurrencies keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement
    agencies analyze blockchains and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive
    payments for hosting services, pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good
    or service you might want to keep private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your
    bank or credit card statement. Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment
    provider for consuming these products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially,
    avoidance becomes easier if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They
    sit there, at a pseudonymous address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or
    laundered. In case owners are willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can
    take a chance at avoiding taxes. They have plausible deniability until they move
    that money to another place that is connected to their identity. Naturally, they
    will delay that connection to their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems,
    parties and amounts in transactions are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially
    by the tax authorities. Although I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people
    for whom cryptocurrency is a piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce
    in low-trust societies is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot
    accept credit card payments because the odds are high that the credit card is
    stolen, and the credit card company will reverse the transactions. They can not
    accept PayPal because these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept
    the burden of proof that they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also
    apply to low-trust industries with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and
    pornography. In a low-trust relationship, online purchases are only possible for
    buyers who are willing to pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the
    buyer or a third party. The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is
    final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee
    that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source
    of friction is your payment system. When you sell products through a webshop,
    you have to automate acceptance of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The
    software that handles these payments has to fit the needs of the trading parties.
    This market for payment solutions is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies,
    and the people that trade them, both change quickly. There are a few significant
    players in this market, but there is no guarantee that they can keep their position.
    Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial technology can look for an
    opening to enter this growing market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency
    is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such
    as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale
    system. Besides, the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate,
    that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction
    of spending because the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate
    the gains you can make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings.
    Then you weigh that against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on.
    When you spend fiat, such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets,
    saving and spending are more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing,
    and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing
    power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,”
    are assuming others want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future
    because it will be the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment
    or investment.The saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific
    “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it
    is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But
    now you have the option to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings
    in new ways. With personal cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer
    and more natural for some people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details
    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want

    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick

    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,

    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians

    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.The Whys of Crypto-AssetsThe companies
    that rely on a cryptocurrency do expand the network so that growth begets growth.
    The positive feedback loop can snowball into an avalanche when the incentives
    are aligned. When each of the players in the ecosystem wants what another has,
    trading volume grows. To understand the motives of these people and see what makes
    them move a crypto-asset around, we can look at them through the lens of a buyer
    persona : an idealized and simplified type of customer, with a story that explains
    their motives and incentives. Software companies often clarify their thinking
    about their market by brainstorming these buyer personas, giving them a name,
    and then imagine that this person is using their software. We will look at these
    buyer personas for crypto-assets because friction in software for crypto-assets
    is always about interacting with technology. Before we discuss the technology
    in the following chapters, we first have to know the types of people who will
    use the hardware and software.At this stage, your customer is an innovator or
    early adopter. They want your crypto product to get an edge, and it has to do
    with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona of users of cryptocurrencies
    in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That is why we have to define
    these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset: earning, saving, investing,
    speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou can earn a crypto-asset when
    you sell a product, service, or labor to someone willing to part with that crypto-asset.
    In case the asset is liquid enough, with a somewhat stable price in fiat currency,
    it will be easy to overcome the friction in the trade. That is because you no
    longer have to buy this asset anymore with fiat currency. You will have to make
    a transaction with someone who owns it and is also open to selling. That person
    also has to want to become your customer, client, or employer. We can expect a
    future in which most earnings of crypto-assets are cryptocurrencies, as these
    have qualities that can make them the most liquid; they are designed to be earned
    in the first place. As of the time of writing in 2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies
    makes the most sense in the following cases:•    Location-independent companies
    with founders and employees across the globe, living in and traveling to multiple
    jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking system, paying these teams is an ordeal.
    Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive and time-consuming. You can pay everyone
    in cryptocurrency because team members can sell their cryptocurrency locally.
    That trade is more natural than to have the company change whatever currency they
    hold into the fiat currency of a specific team member’s country of residence.•    Companies
    that want to attract new customers by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders
    look for opportunities to spend as a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending
    of their holdings saves them the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners
    of companies that want to hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or
    service; they only have to sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency,
    and they hold on to the crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable
    payments and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you
    raise funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell
    gray-area or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as
    nation-state actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to
    stop the incoming transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In
    theory, that means that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force.
    In practice, any blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have
    that strength.•    Private black-market deals for some illegal goods that you
    can sell online. This is an arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market
    sellers. Some cryptocurrencies keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement
    agencies analyze blockchains and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive
    payments for hosting services, pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good
    or service you might want to keep private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your
    bank or credit card statement. Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment
    provider for consuming these products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially,
    avoidance becomes easier if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They
    sit there, at a pseudonymous address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or
    laundered. In case owners are willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can
    take a chance at avoiding taxes. They have plausible deniability until they move
    that money to another place that is connected to their identity. Naturally, they
    will delay that connection to their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems,
    parties and amounts in transactions are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially
    by the tax authorities. Although I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people
    for whom cryptocurrency is a piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce
    in low-trust societies is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot
    accept credit card payments because the odds are high that the credit card is
    stolen, and the credit card company will reverse the transactions. They can not
    accept PayPal because these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept
    the burden of proof that they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also
    apply to low-trust industries with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and
    pornography. In a low-trust relationship, online purchases are only possible for
    buyers who are willing to pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the
    buyer or a third party. The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is
    final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee
    that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source
    of friction is your payment system. When you sell products through a webshop,
    you have to automate acceptance of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The
    software that handles these payments has to fit the needs of the trading parties.
    This market for payment solutions is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies,
    and the people that trade them, both change quickly. There are a few significant
    players in this market, but there is no guarantee that they can keep their position.
    Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial technology can look for an
    opening to enter this growing market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency
    is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such
    as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale
    system. Besides, the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate,
    that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction
    of spending because the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate
    the gains you can make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings.
    Then you weigh that against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on.
    When you spend fiat, such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets,
    saving and spending are more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing,
    and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing
    power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,”
    are assuming others want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future
    because it will be the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment
    or investment.The saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific
    “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it
    is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But
    now you have the option to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings
    in new ways. With personal cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer
    and more natural for some people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details
    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.

    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.

    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service

    is why we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset:

    can earn a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone
    willing to part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with
    a somewhat stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction
    in the trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with
    fiat currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and
    is also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer,
    client, or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets
    are cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.At this stage, your customer is
    an innovator or early adopter. They want your crypto product to get an edge, and
    it has to do with their motives. We can understand the buyer persona of users
    of cryptocurrencies in the context of a financial or monetary goal. That is why
    we have to define these everyday actions as they apply to crypto-asset: earning,
    saving, investing, speculating, and spending.Earning and SpendingYou can earn
    a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone willing to
    part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with a somewhat
    stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction in the
    trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with fiat

    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any

    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Earning and SpendingYou can earn
    a crypto-asset when you sell a product, service, or labor to someone willing to
    part with that crypto-asset. In case the asset is liquid enough, with a somewhat
    stable price in fiat currency, it will be easy to overcome the friction in the
    trade. That is because you no longer have to buy this asset anymore with fiat
    currency. You will have to make a transaction with someone who owns it and is
    also open to selling. That person also has to want to become your customer, client,
    or employer. We can expect a future in which most earnings of crypto-assets are
    cryptocurrencies, as these have qualities that can make them the most liquid;
    they are designed to be earned in the first place. As of the time of writing in
    2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies makes the most sense in the following
    cases:•    Location-independent companies with founders and employees across the
    globe, living in and traveling to multiple jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking
    system, paying these teams is an ordeal. Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive
    and time-consuming. You can pay everyone in cryptocurrency because team members
    can sell their cryptocurrency locally. That trade is more natural than to have
    the company change whatever currency they hold into the fiat currency of a specific
    team member’s country of residence.•    Companies that want to attract new customers
    by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders look for opportunities to spend as
    a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending of their holdings saves them
    the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners of companies that want to
    hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have to
    sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to the
    crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead

    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible

    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.You can earn a crypto-asset when
    you sell a product, service, or labor to someone willing to part with that crypto-asset.
    In case the asset is liquid enough, with a somewhat stable price in fiat currency,
    it will be easy to overcome the friction in the trade. That is because you no
    longer have to buy this asset anymore with fiat currency. You will have to make
    a transaction with someone who owns it and is also open to selling. That person
    also has to want to become your customer, client, or employer. We can expect a
    future in which most earnings of crypto-assets are cryptocurrencies, as these
    have qualities that can make them the most liquid; they are designed to be earned
    in the first place. As of the time of writing in 2020, earning or spending cryptocurrencies
    makes the most sense in the following cases:•    Location-independent companies
    with founders and employees across the globe, living in and traveling to multiple
    jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking system, paying these teams is an ordeal.
    Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive and time-consuming. You can pay everyone
    in cryptocurrency because team members can sell their cryptocurrency locally.
    That trade is more natural than to have the company change whatever currency they
    hold into the fiat currency of a specific team member’s country of residence.•    Companies
    that want to attract new customers by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders
    look for opportunities to spend as a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending
    of their holdings saves them the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners
    of companies that want to hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or
    service; they only have to sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency,
    and they hold on to the crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable
    payments and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you
    raise funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell
    gray-area or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as
    nation-state actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to
    stop the incoming transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In
    theory, that means that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force.
    In practice, any blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have
    that strength.•    Private black-market deals for some illegal goods that you
    can sell online. This is an arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market
    sellers. Some cryptocurrencies keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement
    agencies analyze blockchains and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive
    payments for hosting services, pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good
    or service you might want to keep private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your
    bank or credit card statement. Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment
    provider for consuming these products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially,
    avoidance becomes easier if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They
    sit there, at a pseudonymous address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or
    laundered. In case owners are willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can
    take a chance at avoiding taxes. They have plausible deniability until they move
    that money to another place that is connected to their identity. Naturally, they
    will delay that connection to their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems,
    parties and amounts in transactions are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially
    by the tax authorities. Although I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people
    for whom cryptocurrency is a piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce
    in low-trust societies is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot
    accept credit card payments because the odds are high that the credit card is
    stolen, and the credit card company will reverse the transactions. They can not
    accept PayPal because these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept
    the burden of proof that they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also
    apply to low-trust industries with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and
    pornography. In a low-trust relationship, online purchases are only possible for
    buyers who are willing to pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the
    buyer or a third party. The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is
    final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee
    that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source
    of friction is your payment system. When you sell products through a webshop,
    you have to automate acceptance of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The
    software that handles these payments has to fit the needs of the trading parties.
    This market for payment solutions is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies,
    and the people that trade them, both change quickly. There are a few significant
    players in this market, but there is no guarantee that they can keep their position.
    Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial technology can look for an
    opening to enter this growing market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency
    is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such
    as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale
    system. Besides, the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate,
    that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction
    of spending because the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate
    the gains you can make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings.
    Then you weigh that against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on.
    When you spend fiat, such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets,
    saving and spending are more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing,
    and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing
    power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,”
    are assuming others want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future
    because it will be the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment
    or investment.The saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific
    “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it
    is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But
    now you have the option to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings
    in new ways. With personal cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer
    and more natural for some people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details
    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws

    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Location-independent companies
    with founders and employees across the globe, living in and traveling to multiple
    jurisdictions. Inside the fiat banking system, paying these teams is an ordeal.
    Bookkeeping and remittance become expensive and time-consuming. You can pay everyone
    in cryptocurrency because team members can sell their cryptocurrency locally.
    That trade is more natural than to have the company change whatever currency they
    hold into the fiat currency of a specific team member’s country of residence.•    Companies
    that want to attract new customers by accepting cryptocurrencies. Some holders
    look for opportunities to spend as a way to cash speculative gains. Direct spending
    of their holdings saves them the costs of selling it for fiat currency.•    Owners
    of companies that want to hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or
    service; they only have to sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency,
    and they hold on to the crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable
    payments and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you
    raise funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell
    gray-area or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as
    nation-state actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to
    stop the incoming transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In
    theory, that means that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force.
    In practice, any blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have
    that strength.•    Private black-market deals for some illegal goods that you
    can sell online. This is an arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market
    sellers. Some cryptocurrencies keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement
    agencies analyze blockchains and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive
    payments for hosting services, pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good
    or service you might want to keep private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your
    bank or credit card statement. Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment
    provider for consuming these products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially,
    avoidance becomes easier if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They
    sit there, at a pseudonymous address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or
    laundered. In case owners are willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can
    take a chance at avoiding taxes. They have plausible deniability until they move
    that money to another place that is connected to their identity. Naturally, they
    will delay that connection to their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems,
    parties and amounts in transactions are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially
    by the tax authorities. Although I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people
    for whom cryptocurrency is a piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce
    in low-trust societies is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot
    accept credit card payments because the odds are high that the credit card is
    stolen, and the credit card company will reverse the transactions. They can not
    accept PayPal because these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept
    the burden of proof that they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also
    apply to low-trust industries with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and
    pornography. In a low-trust relationship, online purchases are only possible for
    buyers who are willing to pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the
    buyer or a third party. The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is
    final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee
    that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source
    of friction is your payment system. When you sell products through a webshop,
    you have to automate acceptance of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The
    software that handles these payments has to fit the needs of the trading parties.
    This market for payment solutions is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies,
    and the people that trade them, both change quickly. There are a few significant
    players in this market, but there is no guarantee that they can keep their position.
    Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial technology can look for an
    opening to enter this growing market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency
    is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such
    as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale
    system. Besides, the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate,
    that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction
    of spending because the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate
    the gains you can make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings.
    Then you weigh that against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on.
    When you spend fiat, such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets,
    saving and spending are more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing,
    and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing
    power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,”
    are assuming others want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future
    because it will be the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment
    or investment.The saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific
    “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it
    is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But
    now you have the option to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings
    in new ways. With personal cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer
    and more natural for some people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details
    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service

    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Owners of companies that want
    to hold crypto-assets who have a high-margin product or service; they only have
    to sell a portion to pay their suppliers in fiat currency, and they hold on to
    the crypto-assets or change them for other crypto-assets.•    Uncensorable payments
    and donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise
    funds for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible

    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Uncensorable payments and
    donations for controversial projects, companies, and NGOs. When you raise funds
    for resistance fighting, protests, or other activism, when you sell gray-area
    or black market medicine, the earning party has adversaries, such as nation-state
    actors, intelligence agencies, or nasty competitors. They want to stop the incoming
    transactions and are willing to bear some cost for that. In theory, that means
    that the strength of your blockchain has to match their force. In practice, any
    blockchain that is supporting a liquid cryptocurrency will have that strength.•    Private
    black-market deals for some illegal goods that you can sell online. This is an
    arms race between law enforcement agencies and black-market sellers. Some cryptocurrencies
    keep boosting privacy features, and law enforcement agencies analyze blockchains
    and web traffic to catch illegal trade.•    Sensitive payments for hosting services,
    pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might want to keep
    private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card statement.
    Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming these
    products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes easier
    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion

    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available

    if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They sit there, at a pseudonymous
    address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or laundered. In case owners are
    willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can take a chance at avoiding taxes.
    They have plausible deniability until they move that money to another place that
    is connected to their identity. Naturally, they will delay that connection to
    their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems, parties and amounts in transactions
    are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially by the tax authorities. Although
    I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people for whom cryptocurrency is a
    piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies is impossible
    with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card payments because
    the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit card company
    will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because these transactions
    can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that they have shipped
    the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries with a high
    chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust relationship,
    online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to pay upfront,
    in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party. The seller has
    to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When
    earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment system. When you
    sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance of the payment,
    billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments has to fit
    the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions is fresh and
    dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them, both change
    quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there is no guarantee
    that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial
    technology can look for an opening to enter this growing market.From a technical
    perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens
    between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between
    a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers
    that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus
    valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility
    as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold
    the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of
    the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Sensitive payments for hosting
    services, pornography, gambling, or prostitution—any good or service you might
    want to keep private. Cryptocurrencies never show up on your bank or credit card
    statement. Also, you avoid being cut off by your fiat payment provider for consuming
    these products and services.•    Tax planning and, potentially, avoidance becomes

    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Tax planning and, potentially,
    avoidance becomes easier if the earnings never arrive in a bank account. They
    sit there, at a pseudonymous address on the blockchain, waiting to be spent or
    laundered. In case owners are willing to take the risk of prosecution, they can
    take a chance at avoiding taxes. They have plausible deniability until they move
    that money to another place that is connected to their identity. Naturally, they
    will delay that connection to their identity as long as they can. In fiat systems,
    parties and amounts in transactions are known by the bank and, therefore, potentially
    by the tax authorities. Although I do not endorse tax avoidance, I have met people
    for whom cryptocurrency is a piece in their tax-planning puzzle.•    e-Commerce
    in low-trust societies is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot
    accept credit card payments because the odds are high that the credit card is
    stolen, and the credit card company will reverse the transactions. They can not
    accept PayPal because these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept
    the burden of proof that they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also
    apply to low-trust industries with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and
    pornography. In a low-trust relationship, online purchases are only possible for
    buyers who are willing to pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the
    buyer or a third party. The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is
    final before he can ship the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee
    that finality, empowering new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source
    of friction is your payment system. When you sell products through a webshop,
    you have to automate acceptance of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The
    software that handles these payments has to fit the needs of the trading parties.
    This market for payment solutions is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies,
    and the people that trade them, both change quickly. There are a few significant
    players in this market, but there is no guarantee that they can keep their position.
    Software entrepreneurs with experience in financial technology can look for an
    opening to enter this growing market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency
    is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such
    as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale
    system. Besides, the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate,
    that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction
    of spending because the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate
    the gains you can make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings.
    Then you weigh that against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on.
    When you spend fiat, such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets,
    saving and spending are more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing,
    and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing
    power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,”
    are assuming others want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future
    because it will be the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment
    or investment.The saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific
    “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it
    is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But
    now you have the option to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings
    in new ways. With personal cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer
    and more natural for some people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details
    in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors want to keep value over time and
    generate a return from it, such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent
    it out. We can imagine that tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade
    between people that have a wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled
    investment in real estate, you can divide the property into many small pieces
    that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics

    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    e-Commerce in low-trust societies
    is impossible with fiat currency. An online merchant cannot accept credit card
    payments because the odds are high that the credit card is stolen, and the credit
    card company will reverse the transactions. They can not accept PayPal because
    these transactions can be reversed, and refuse to accept the burden of proof that
    they have shipped the goods. The same limitations also apply to low-trust industries
    with a high chargeback rate, such as gambling and pornography. In a low-trust
    relationship, online purchases are only possible for buyers who are willing to
    pay upfront, in a way that can not be reversed by the buyer or a third party.
    The seller has to get a guarantee that the payment is final before he can ship
    the goods. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can guarantee that finality, empowering
    new e-commerce.When earning cryptocurrency, one source of friction is your payment
    system. When you sell products through a webshop, you have to automate acceptance
    of the payment, billing, and bookkeeping. The software that handles these payments
    has to fit the needs of the trading parties. This market for payment solutions
    is fresh and dynamic because cryptocurrencies, and the people that trade them,
    both change quickly. There are a few significant players in this market, but there
    is no guarantee that they can keep their position. Software entrepreneurs with
    experience in financial technology can look for an opening to enter this growing
    market.From a technical perspective, spending cryptocurrency is similar to earning.
    The friction happens between the sender and receiver, such as between wallets
    and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit card and a point-of-sale system. Besides,
    the spender also considers that some cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can
    become more scarce and thus valuable. This adds to the friction of spending because
    the asset also has utility as a store of value. You estimate the gains you can
    make by continuing to hold the asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that
    against the benefits of the goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat,
    such a consideration does not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are
    more at odds than with fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold
    an asset because we expect it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future.
    Holders of crypto-assets, or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others
    want to hold, earn, or spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be
    the best option for unstoppable, secure, and convenient payment or investment.The
    saver wants to deal with the unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item”
    in the foreseeable future. You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your
    savings are in fiat currency, the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option
    to rely on cryptography instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal
    cryptography in the mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some
    people than in banks. We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet
    technology.Investors want to keep value over time and generate a return from it,
    such as when they buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that
    tokenized real estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a
    wallet. Instead of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate,
    you can divide the property into many small pieces that become tradable between
    people with wallets.Speculation on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets
    is the primary driver of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other
    available assets are limited and not the cause of the current price level. To
    explain the price, we have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a
    set of future benefits, related to money and finance, on which you can speculate
    by holding. Stories about the future are various and unstable, with price moves
    driven by whimsical speculators. However, crypto-assets can already be a tool
    in your portfolio because they are a new asset class, and the price tends to move
    independently of other assets.The bright future of crypto-assets can only become
    real with benefits for specific buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that
    space of possibilities by asking questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary
    BTC transactions are too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too
    slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough
    for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze
    your account.•    Credit card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment
    and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for
    black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and PayPal will not process
    payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit card payments are
    not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings
    accounts and treasury bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because
    of the risk of currency inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper
    cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks
    are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes
    a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers
    do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should
    an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend
    it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations
    of particular media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next
    chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup
    ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down
    to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying
    that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets
    could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to
    see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced
    forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space
    will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to
    whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons
    to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.

    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant

    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.From a technical perspective, spending
    cryptocurrency is similar to earning. The friction happens between the sender
    and receiver, such as between wallets and exchanges, or between a Bitcoin debit
    card and a point-of-sale system. Besides, the spender also considers that some
    cryptocurrencies deflate, that is, they can become more scarce and thus valuable.
    This adds to the friction of spending because the asset also has utility as a
    store of value. You estimate the gains you can make by continuing to hold the
    asset as part of your savings. Then you weigh that against the benefits of the
    goods you plan to spend it on. When you spend fiat, such a consideration does
    not exist. With crypto-assets, saving and spending are more at odds than with
    fiat currency.Saving, Investing, and SpeculatingWe hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right

    cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks
    are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes
    a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers
    do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should
    an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend
    it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations
    of particular media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next
    chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup
    ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down
    to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying
    that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets
    could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to
    see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced
    forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space
    will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to
    whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons
    to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.We hold an asset because we expect
    it to keep or boost our purchasing power in the future. Holders of crypto-assets,
    or affectionately called “HODLers,” are assuming others want to hold, earn, or
    spend that crypto-asset in the future because it will be the best option for unstoppable,
    secure, and convenient payment or investment.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you

    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The

    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.The saver wants to deal with the
    unexpected or to buy a specific “high-ticket item” in the foreseeable future.
    You keep the money safe while it is accruing. If your savings are in fiat currency,
    the bank keeps it secure. But now you have the option to rely on cryptography
    instead. You can secure savings in new ways. With personal cryptography in the
    mix, storing value can be safer and more natural for some people than in banks.
    We will discuss some of the details in the chapter on wallet technology.Investors
    want to keep value over time and generate a return from it, such as when they
    buy a piece of real estate and rent it out. We can imagine that tokenized real
    estate becomes more natural to trade between people that have a wallet. Instead
    of owning one building, or a pooled investment in real estate, you can divide
    the property into many small pieces that become tradable between people with wallets.Speculation
    on the future price of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver
    of the price. The concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are
    limited and not the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we
    have to account for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits,
    related to money and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about
    the future are various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators.
    However, crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are
    a new asset class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The
    bright future of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific
    buyer personas and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking
    questions that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are
    too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for
    retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work

    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,

    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of

    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Speculation on the future price
    of bitcoin and other top crypto-assets is the primary driver of the price. The
    concrete benefits of BTC, ETH, and other available assets are limited and not
    the cause of the current price level. To explain the price, we have to account
    for the future. Crypto-assets promise a set of future benefits, related to money
    and finance, on which you can speculate by holding. Stories about the future are
    various and unstable, with price moves driven by whimsical speculators. However,
    crypto-assets can already be a tool in your portfolio because they are a new asset
    class, and the price tends to move independently of other assets.The bright future
    of crypto-assets can only become real with benefits for specific buyer personas
    and use cases. We can explore that space of possibilities by asking questions
    that start with a lack. For example:•    Ordinary BTC transactions are too costly
    for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive for retail payments.•    PayPal
    is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce payments as a merchant
    because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit card companies charge
    the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment after 60 days.•    TransferWise
    is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and
    PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit
    card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or
    controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury bonds are not secure
    enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency inflation or outright
    collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal
    payment networks are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third
    party.As money becomes a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems
    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will

    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Ordinary BTC transactions
    are too costly for small payments.•    Wire transfers are too slow and expensive
    for retail payments.•    PayPal is not secure and final enough for receiving e-commerce
    payments as a merchant because they can and do freeze your account.•    Credit
    card companies charge the merchant a percentage per payment and finalize the payment
    after 60 days.•    TransferWise is not open enough for black market transactions.•    Credit
    card companies and PayPal will not process payments of the online purchase of
    some medicines.•    Credit card payments are not free (as in speech) enough for
    buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings accounts and treasury
    bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because of the risk of currency
    inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to

    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the

    to disappear. These containers do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency.
    Money is money: why should an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine
    how you hold or spend it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to
    transcend these limitations of particular media. We will explore the opportunities
    of ideal money in the next chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses
    the source of startup ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested
    methods boil down to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.”
    Another way of saying that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked
    at how crypto-assets could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating
    buyer personas to see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective
    they have on advanced forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the
    current crypto space will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is
    worthwhile to know to whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,

    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    TransferWise is not open enough
    for black market transactions.•    Credit card companies and PayPal will not process
    payments of the online purchase of some medicines.•    Credit card payments are
    not free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings
    accounts and treasury bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because
    of the risk of currency inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper
    cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks
    are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes
    a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers
    do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should
    an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend
    it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations
    of particular media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next
    chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup
    ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down
    to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying
    that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets
    could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to
    see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced
    forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space
    will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to
    whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons
    to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and

    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Credit card payments are not
    free (as in speech) enough for buying medicines online or controversial donations.•    Savings
    accounts and treasury bonds are not secure enough for long-term savings because
    of the risk of currency inflation or outright collapse of the debtor.•    Paper
    cash is unsuitable for payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks
    are too slow or insecure because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes
    a free and flexible medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers
    do not limit an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should
    an arbitrary medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend
    it? Once you see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations
    of particular media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next
    chapter.The entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup
    ideas in his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down
    to: “Live in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying
    that is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets
    could be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to
    see how crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced
    forms of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space
    will sell to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to
    whom you are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons
    to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I

    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.•    Paper cash is unsuitable for
    payments over long distances.•    Informal payment networks are too slow or insecure
    because of vulnerability to a third party.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion

    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.As money becomes a free and flexible
    medium, we can expect these problems to disappear. These containers do not limit
    an economy that relies on cryptocurrency. Money is money: why should an arbitrary
    medium or custodian for your wealth determine how you hold or spend it? Once you
    see the features of ideal money, you itch to transcend these limitations of particular
    media. We will explore the opportunities of ideal money in the next chapter.The
    entrepreneur and investor Paul Graham discusses the source of startup ideas in
    his essay How to Get Startup Ideas . His suggested methods boil down to: “Live
    in the future, and work on what seems interesting.” Another way of saying that
    is: notice what is missing. Now that we have looked at how crypto-assets could
    be used, we review a few examples of these innovating buyer personas to see how
    crypto-assets enter their reality and what perspective they have on advanced forms
    of money. Entrepreneurs who start a company in the current crypto space will sell
    to at least one of these buyer personas. It is worthwhile to know to whom you
    are selling.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere are multiple reasons to
    care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a type of crypto-enthusiast.
    These different enthusiasts help to grow the network of a given crypto-asset.
    These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine in a single person,
    with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people show up at conferences
    and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail; they are often working
    professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion of their savings.
    In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962), they are the innovators
    who are willing and able to take risks with new technology. As an entrepreneur,
    you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage their imagination
    and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass. They buy into
    applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto journey forward.
    You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time of writing in
    2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual

    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Early Adopters as Potential CustomersThere
    are multiple reasons to care about cryptocurrencies, and each idea motivates a
    type of crypto-enthusiast. These different enthusiasts help to grow the network
    of a given crypto-asset. These reasons for caring about cryptocurrency often combine
    in a single person, with one or two motives at the forefront. These types of people
    show up at conferences and meetups to discuss cryptocurrencies and tokens in detail;
    they are often working professionally with crypto-assets or have invested a portion
    of their savings. In Everett Roger’s model of Diffusion of Innovations (1962),
    they are the innovators who are willing and able to take risks with new technology.
    As an entrepreneur, you might care about an innovator’s opinion. Can you engage
    their imagination and inspire them to act? That is a test your product must pass.
    They buy into applications, platforms, and crypto-assets that move their crypto
    journey forward. You want them to approve of your product or service.At the time
    of writing in 2020, cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion,
    early adopters : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth
    is. They drive the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these
    journeys, we get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound
    money, unstoppable code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts
    I have met behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA
    software developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and
    experimentation, but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems
    is their entertainment. They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they
    often have a job or freelance career in technology, with the skills to develop
    software. They get paid to solve problems of design and architecture to make the
    systems work. They are always looking for more tools to play with and to get things
    done. The goal is to build something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested
    in blockchain technology, they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look
    at the code to see how they can use it to build a system that supports a new type
    of transaction.The drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging
    into a technical rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending
    too much time on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in
    the metaphors they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do
    not see the forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared
    the feature of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing
    on how a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for
    fragility. However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes
    something heavy and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe
    the immutability of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting
    professional Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money.
    They understood how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not
    appreciate the greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has
    opportunity costs.Playful developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology
    because it defines a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems.
    They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics
    to computer programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders
    of the crypto sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or
    employee. Much of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early
    adopters, they are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous
    EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts
    a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger
    than life’—personality and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists
    who can see the big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to
    their industry. Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws
    a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate
    a “reality distortion field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists
    with a common goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower
    entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening
    a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field.
    Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they
    have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want
    to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents
    who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick
    the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain
    on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.

    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.At the time of writing in 2020,
    cryptocurrencies have diffused to the next stage of diffusion, early adopters
    : opinion leaders who put their cryptocurrency where their mouth is. They drive
    the story forward to the early majority . When we add up all these journeys, we
    get a megatrend: the replacement of the fiat status quo with sound money, unstoppable
    code, crypto-assets, and decentralized finance.All crypto enthusiasts I have met
    behave like one or more of these five buyer personas:Playful DevelopersA software
    developer builds systems. They may look serious in their studies and experimentation,
    but their work feels more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment.
    They like to tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance
    career in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve
    problems of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always
    looking for more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build
    something exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology,
    they focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how
    they can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The
    drawback of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical
    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.
    However, the quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy
    and solid, such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability
    of the transactions. Another example that surprised me was meeting professional
    Ethereum developers who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood
    how particular crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the
    greater context in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful
    developers care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines
    a field of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble
    the teenagers in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer
    programming because any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto
    sphere, we find developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much
    of the resources they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they
    are likely to become a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting
    a company is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses
    bitcoin, blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality
    and a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the
    big picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry.
    Furthermore, they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them.
    Like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion
    field” that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common
    goal.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs
    to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and
    disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs
    of generation X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the
    internet grow up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the
    disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own
    the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right
    project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on
    top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members,
    and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble.
    A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and
    knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation
    first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example,
    the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to
    “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money better
    than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.

    rabbit hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time
    on the details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors
    they use to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the
    forest. For example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature
    of ‘immutability’ to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how
    a hash function depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility.

    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.A software developer builds systems.
    They may look serious in their studies and experimentation, but their work feels
    more like creative play. Solving problems is their entertainment. They like to
    tinker with hardware or software, and they often have a job or freelance career
    in technology, with the skills to develop software. They get paid to solve problems
    of design and architecture to make the systems work. They are always looking for
    more tools to play with and to get things done. The goal is to build something
    exciting and new. When a developer gets interested in blockchain technology, they
    focus on the possibilities of the tools. They look at the code to see how they
    can use it to build a system that supports a new type of transaction.The drawback
    of a developer’s tool obsession is the risk of digging into a technical rabbit
    hole, where they miss out on the big picture. When spending too much time on the
    details in the code, their wrong-headed ideas show up in the metaphors they use
    to describe a blockchain. They focus on the trees and do not see the forest. For
    example, I have met a blockchain developer who compared the feature of ‘immutability’
    to “a house of cards,” which is wrong. He was focusing on how a hash function
    depends on the input, leading him to choose an image for fragility. However, the
    quality of immutability requires an image that evokes something heavy and solid,
    such as “layers in a glacier,” suitable to describe the immutability of the transactions.
    Another example that surprised me was meeting professional Ethereum developers
    who had never thought about the origins of money. They understood how particular
    crypto-assets worked in great detail but did not appreciate the greater context
    in which these assets work. Specialization has opportunity costs.Playful developers
    care about Bitcoin and other blockchain technology because it defines a field
    of possibilities to build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble the teenagers
    in the 90s who switched from print board electronics to computer programming because
    any new thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto sphere, we find
    developers in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much of the resources
    they use are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they are likely to become
    a customer of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting a company
    is ambitious, and the type of person that starts a startup that uses bitcoin,
    blockchain, or crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality and
    a vision for the future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the big
    picture. Some are specialists in several areas relevant to their industry. Furthermore,
    they have the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them. Like Steve
    Jobs or Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion field”
    that supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common goal.Bitcoin,
    Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs to take out the
    middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and disrupting the
    incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs of generation
    X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the internet grow
    up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the disruptive force
    of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own the traditional
    financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right project. It
    is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on top of an
    arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members, and customers
    see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble. A good startup
    idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and knowing your tools.
    Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation first. It is reckless
    to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example, the infrastructure inertia
    of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to “bank the unbanked,” you better
    know exactly how your startup moves money better than the informal network of
    relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain entrepreneurs can
    protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down. They can study
    the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar with the
    ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup idea is
    a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often referred
    to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best places
    for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain conferences.
    Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and your idea
    can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However, if a crypto
    veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are likely better

    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Playful developers care about Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technology because it defines a field of possibilities to
    build new trinkets and systems. They can resemble the teenagers in the 90s who
    switched from print board electronics to computer programming because any new
    thing is cool. As the hands-on builders of the crypto sphere, we find developers
    in the role of supplier, founder, or employee. Much of the resources they use
    are open source or low cost. As early adopters, they are likely to become a customer
    of one of the other types.Adventurous EntrepreneursStarting a company is ambitious,
    and the type of person that starts a startup that uses bitcoin, blockchain, or
    crypto-asset tends to have a ‘larger than life’—personality and a vision for the
    future. Most entrepreneurs are generalists who can see the big picture. Some are
    specialists in several areas relevant to their industry. Furthermore, they have
    the magnetism and leadership that draws a team around them. Like Steve Jobs or
    Elon Musk, their passion and energy generate a “reality distortion field” that
    supports return-on-effort for a group of specialists with a common goal.Bitcoin,
    Ethereum, and maybe other blockchains will empower entrepreneurs to take out the
    middleman. The entrepreneur gets excited by opening a market and disrupting the
    incumbent monopoly power that dominates the field. Entrepreneurs of generation
    X and Y know disruption in their gut because they have seen the internet grow
    up from a toy into a global utility. Now they want to harness the disruptive force
    of immutable blockchains to disintermediate incumbents who own the traditional
    financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge is to pick the right project. It
    is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering a blockchain on top of an
    arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential team members, and customers
    see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is a bad gamble. A good startup
    idea comes from understanding the problems in your industry and knowing your tools.
    Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s situation first. It is reckless
    to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for example, the infrastructure inertia
    of your favorite supply chain. If you are going to “bank the unbanked,” you better
    know exactly how your startup moves money better than the informal network of
    relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain entrepreneurs can
    protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down. They can study
    the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar with the
    ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup idea is
    a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often referred
    to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best places
    for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain conferences.
    Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and your idea
    can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However, if a crypto
    veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are likely better
    off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I suggested in the
    introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems that this type of
    crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion of crypto-assets
    in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology into the
    mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to crypto
    investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.,
    there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor. We
    can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets

    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and maybe other
    blockchains will empower entrepreneurs to take out the middleman. The entrepreneur
    gets excited by opening a market and disrupting the incumbent monopoly power that
    dominates the field. Entrepreneurs of generation X and Y know disruption in their
    gut because they have seen the internet grow up from a toy into a global utility.
    Now they want to harness the disruptive force of immutable blockchains to disintermediate
    incumbents who own the traditional financial system.The entrepreneur’s challenge
    is to pick the right project. It is tempting to take the dream too far by plastering
    a blockchain on top of an arbitrary industry, and pray that investors, potential
    team members, and customers see the light. Such a rushed blockchain startup is
    a bad gamble. A good startup idea comes from understanding the problems in your
    industry and knowing your tools. Furthermore, you have to understand your customer’s
    situation first. It is reckless to assume that “the blockchain” can solve, for
    example, the infrastructure inertia of your favorite supply chain. If you are
    going to “bank the unbanked,” you better know exactly how your startup moves money
    better than the informal network of relationships currently serving that demographic.Blockchain
    entrepreneurs can protect themselves against a lousy startup idea by slowing down.
    They can study the basics and recent history of Bitcoin and Ethereum to get familiar
    with the ways a project can fail. The quality test for your blockchain startup
    idea is a trial-by- fire: can you pitch your idea to the early Bitcoiners, often
    referred to as “original gangsters,” and answer their pointed questions? The best
    places for these discussions are Bitcoin meetups and cocktail parties at blockchain
    conferences. Or, if you have a good web presence, ask your followers. If you and
    your idea can hold their own in a debate, your startup is in good shape. However,
    if a crypto veteran can incinerate the plan with one magical question, you are
    likely better off ejecting with a burned ego than burning investor money.As I
    suggested in the introduction, entrepreneurs are my primary audience. It seems
    that this type of crypto enthusiast will have the most influence on the diffusion
    of crypto-assets in society. They will have to take the risks that push this technology
    into the mainstream.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to
    crypto investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore,
    etc., there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor.
    We can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts

    the market will lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify
    traders based on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences
    between marketplaces. They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets
    “over the counter” (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network.
    In the ideal case, arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same
    time, profiting from the price difference between the two markets. These windows
    of opportunity open and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full
    time, analyzing the market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that
    run optimized algorithms to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires
    nerves of steel and the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous
    careers in online poker or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position
    traders stay in or out of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend.
    You can do this with a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive
    as the other types of trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely
    to have an information advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet
    that the asset they hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for
    pricing products, services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon
    and a degree of understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy
    is limited to the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple,
    and top privacy currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data
    that help them analyze the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can
    attract them as customers by building a superior exchange, platform, or source
    of data.Industry service providersThe blockchain industry has much building and
    educating to do. The technology is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further
    adoption of crypto-assets by new markets requires a smooth user experience and
    storytelling. There is work to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have
    started offering services to startups that develop crypto-related products and
    services. With the right timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a
    service provider, you gain an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the
    one hand, it is riskier because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is
    immature. On the other hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover
    advantage and settle in a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new
    service providers have a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin,
    blockchain, and crypto-assets are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs
    and developers who build the ecosystem. These types tend to be designers, educators,
    and marketers.The entrance of these supporting service providers suggests the
    innovators are becoming connected to early adopters, who are more numerous. At
    first, the typical crypto enthusiasts were of the other four types, such as developers,
    traders, and anarchists. Suddenly, there were waves of people showing up with
    a marketing and communications background. They are motivated by the opportunity
    to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the crypto space benefits from this
    pool of talent.If entrepreneurs are your customers, aim to connect them to crypto
    investors. In technology hubs like San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.,
    there already exists a lively ecosystem for connecting the capital to labor. We
    can view the ICO boom that peaked in 2017 as the first step to decentralizing
    that ecosystem. Retail investors now have options similar to those of angel investors
    and venture capitalists (VCs), and they need tools to make sense of available
    deals. Also, entrepreneurs need the tools to organize a token sale and process
    payments.Although the market for ICOs has its growing pains, the globalization
    and democratization of startup funding is too large a trend to ignore. Issuing
    a token to a global market of retail investors could potentially be faster than
    selling to an elite of angel investors and VCs. Although much capital is available
    in technology hubs, that amount is small compared to what is available worldwide.
    Venture funding at a large scale and top speed have a place in the future of crypto-assets.
    As an entrepreneur, you can prepare for fast and easy financing of the best ideas.Activists,
    Anarchists, and LibertariansA portion of crypto enthusiasts pursues individual
    liberty. They have political motivations and see their crypto-assets as tools
    of activism to fight a system they consider unjust. Anarchists and libertarians
    have minority views of property rights, and they resist some of the mainstream
    methods for acquiring and defending material wealth. Some oppose intellectual
    property rights. Some oppose specific taxes or taxation in general. Others disagree
    with the government’s monopoly on violence and law.The lovers of liberty care
    about the political effects that a given crypto-asset can support. A new balance
    of power between centralized government and individuals could mean economic transition
    toward a better society. Activists try to liquidate unjust power. For privacy
    advocates, anarchists, and libertarians, Bitcoin gave rise to a new hope. Instead
    of a fruitless debate about government finance and fiat currency, they can create,
    buy, and spend their preferred money. The existence of crypto-assets enables them
    to exit from the financial system that disagrees with their values.Anarchists
    and activists will use software that protects them from surveillance and censorship.
    They want private internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of
    speech, freedom of association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible
    these tools are, the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers
    expect the rise of a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and
    Twitter, which are losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship.
    For now, centralized social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy.
    As soon there are social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without
    a loss of convenience, the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several
    startups have built identity systems and protocols that adapt to people who care
    about privacy and anonymity. Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating
    systems can be a part of the future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to
    build them.TradersTraders aim to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend
    on a decisive information advantage; you know more than the other players in the
    market. As a trader, you see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents.
    To profit consistently, you need understanding and experience to develop that
    advantage. Your competition is using the best data and algorithms available, and
    you need something that gives you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve.
    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the

    Learning to trade is like becoming a medical professional; Doing the first-aid
    course is not the same as going to medical school. Studying massage therapy for
    four years is not the same as becoming a neurosurgeon in fifteen years. Medical
    sophistication is a deep game, and “day trading” and arbitrage are similar to
    medical skills in depth and complexity. However, unlike medical expertise, the
    risks and rewards of trading are varied. Most people who enter the market will
    lose their money to the most advanced professionals. We classify traders based
    on their time horizon:Arbitrageurs profit from price differences between marketplaces.
    They use trading bots on exchanges or deal in crypto-assets “over the counter”
    (OTC) with buyers and sellers in their professional network. In the ideal case,
    arbitrage has no risk because you buy and sell at the same time, profiting from
    the price difference between the two markets. These windows of opportunity open
    and close quickly.Day traders sit behind their screen full time, analyzing the
    market with charts and algorithms. They often use bots that run optimized algorithms
    to find and execute the best trades. Day trading requires nerves of steel and
    the ability to sit still. Many crypto traders had previous careers in online poker
    or traded fiat currencies with leverage (FOREX).Position traders stay in or out
    of the market for several weeks or months to ride a trend. You can do this with
    a smaller time commitment as it is not as labor-intensive as the other types of
    trading. But it is harder to profit, as you are unlikely to have an information
    advantage.HODLers invest and plan never to sell; they bet that the asset they
    hold will replace fiat currency for saving, paying, and for pricing products,
    services, and investments. HODLing requires a long time horizon and a degree of
    understanding and faith in the held crypto-asset. This strategy is limited to
    the assets with the highest market cap, such as BTC, ETH, Ripple, and top privacy
    currencies.As a group, traders are looking for tools and data that help them analyze
    the market and connect them to new opportunities. You can attract them as customers
    by building a superior exchange, platform, or source of data.Industry service
    providersThe blockchain industry has much building and educating to do. The technology
    is still scrappy, opaque, and confusing. Further adoption of crypto-assets by
    new markets requires a smooth user experience and storytelling. There is work
    to do, and marketers, designers, and educators have started offering services
    to startups that develop crypto-related products and services. With the right
    timing, they can be on the right side of history.As a service provider, you gain
    an advantage by working in a growing industry. On the one hand, it is riskier
    because there are fewer clients, and the marketplace is immature. On the other
    hand, the service provider can establish a first-mover advantage and settle in
    a comfortable niche before the masses show up. These new service providers have
    a good sense of timing and momentum, seeing that Bitcoin, blockchain, and crypto-assets
    are the next big thing. They help entrepreneurs and developers who build the ecosystem.
    These types tend to be designers, educators, and marketers.The entrance of these
    supporting service providers suggests the innovators are becoming connected to
    early adopters, who are more numerous. At first, the typical crypto enthusiasts
    were of the other four types, such as developers, traders, and anarchists. Suddenly,
    there were waves of people showing up with a marketing and communications background.
    They are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills in exciting ventures—the
    crypto space benefits from this pool of talent.Anarchists and activists will use
    software that protects them from surveillance and censorship. They want private
    internet and pseudonymous identities, to support freedom of speech, freedom of
    association, and freedom of transaction. The more accessible these tools are,
    the more mainstream they become. For example, many observers expect the rise of
    a decentralized social network that can replace Facebook and Twitter, which are
    losing their reputation to scandals of privacy and censorship. For now, centralized
    social networks are “better” because they are quick and easy. As soon there are
    social networks on which you are private and uncensorable without a loss of convenience,
    the centralized social networks are disrupted. Several startups have built identity
    systems and protocols that adapt to people who care about privacy and anonymity.
    Pseudonymous and anonymous identities and rating systems can be a part of the
    future of crypto-assets. All we need is people to build them.TradersTraders aim
    to buy low and sell high. Successful traders depend on a decisive information
    advantage; you know more than the other players in the market. As a trader, you
    see a future reality that is yet unknown to your opponents. To profit consistently,
    you need understanding and experience to develop that advantage. Your competition
    is using the best data and algorithms available, and you need something that gives
    you an edge.Trading has a steep learning curve. Learning to trade is like becoming
