    minds of investors and the general public toward financial markets by the end
    of 2008\. The 2008 financial crisis is considered by numerous economists to have
    been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The years leading
    up to the crisis saw a flood of irresponsible mortgage lending and a massive systemic
    failure of financial regulation and supervision. The fallout was so immense that
    it threatened the collapse of large financial institutions. National governments
    had to intercede to bail out major banks. This chapter begins with a discussion
    about the 2008 financial crisis, and then we discuss the aftermath, which led
    to an environment where a new banking system and alternative currency such as
    Bitcoin could thrive. Then, we dive into the technology stack that powers Bitcoin.
    Remarkably, the components of this stack are not entirely new, but they are strung
    together in an ingenious design. Finally, we end the discussion by talking about
    the heightened interest in blockchain, a major technical breakthrough that has
    the potential to revolutionize several industries.

    an unknown individual under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who dreamed of changing
    the financial world. Any number of parties can be blamed for the financial crisis,
    but the common denominator was that fundamental financial and accounting instruments
    used to maintain integrity of the entire system became too complex to be used
    efficiently. Trust, the ultimate adhesive of all financial systems, began to disappear
    in 2008\. The regulations have since changed to prevent similar circumstances
    from arising, but it was clear that there was a need for autoregulation of trust
    between counterparties and transparency into their ability to enter any type of
    a sales contract. A counterparty is essentially the other party in a financial
    transaction. In other words, it is the buyer matched to a seller. In financial
    transactions, one of the many risks involved is called counterparty risk , the
    risk that each party involved in a contract might not be able to fulfill its side
    of the agreement. The systemic failure referenced earlier can now be understood
    in terms of counterparty risk: Both parties in the transaction were accumulating
    massive counterparty risk, and in the end, both parties collapsed under the terms
    of the contract. Imagine a similar transaction scenario involving multiple parties,
    and now imagine that every single player in this scenario is a major bank or insurance
    company that further serves millions of customers. This is just what happened
    during the 2008 crisis.The next issue we need to discuss is that of double spending
    . We revisit this topic again strictly in the context of Bitcoin, but let’s get
    a basic understanding of the concept by applying it to the financial crisis. The
    principle behind double spending is that resources committed to one domain (e.g.,
    one transaction) cannot also be simulataneously committed to a second disparate
    domain. This concept has obvious implications for digital currencies, but it can
    also summarize some of the problems during the 2008 crisis.Here’s how it started:
    Loans (in the form of mortages) were given to borrowers with poor credit histories
    who struggled to repay them. These high-risk mortgages were sold to financial
    experts at the big banks, who packaged them into low-risk public stocks by putting
    large numbers of them together in pools. This type of pooling would work when
    the risks associated with each loan (mortgage) are not correlated. The experts
    at big banks hypothesized that property values in different cities across the
    country would change independently and therefore pooling would not be risky. This
    proved to be a massive mistake. The pooled mortage packages were then used to
    purchase a type of stock called collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The CDOs
    were divided into tiers and sold to investors. The tiers were ranked and rated
    by financial standards agencies and investors bought the safest tiers based on
    those ratings. Once the U.S. housing market turned, it set off a domino effect,
    destroying everything in the way. The CDOs turned out to be worthless, despite
    the ratings. The pooled mortgages collapsed in value and all the packages being
    sold instantly vaporized. Throughout this complex string of transactions, every
    sale increased the risk and incurred double spending at multiple levels. Eventually,
    the system equilibrated, only to find massive gaps, and collapsed under the weight.
    Following is a brief timeline for 2008\. (This timeline was made following a presentation
    by Micah Winkelspech at Distributed Health, 2016).'

    the type of environment that would allow for Bitcoin to flourish. In November
    2008, a paper was posted on the Cryptography and Cryptography Policy Mailing List
    titled “ [Bitcoin : A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf),”
    with a single author named Satoshi Nakamoto. This paper detailed the Bitcoin protocol
    and along with it came the original code for early versions of Bitcoin. In some
    manner, this paper was a response to the economic crash that had just happened,
    but it would be some time before this technological revolution caught on. Some
    developers were concerned with this electronic cash system failing before it could
    ever take hold and their concern was scalability, as pointed out in Figure [1-1](#Fig1).![A430562_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-1.Initial reception of the Bitcoin protocol included concerns about scalability
    and realistic prospects for BitcoinSo who is Nakamoto? What is his background?
    The short and simple answer is that we don’t know. In fact, it is presumptuous
    to assume that he is actually a “he.” The name Satoshi Nakamoto was larely used
    as a pseudonym and he could have been a she, or even a they. Several reporters
    and news outlets have dedicated time and energy to digital forensics to narrow
    down candidates and find out the real identity of Nakamoto, but all the efforts
    so far have been [wild-goose chases](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/527051/the-man-who-really-built-bitcoin/).
    In this case, the community is starting to realize that maybe it doesn’t matter
    who Nakamoto is, because the nature of open source almost makes it irrelavent.
    Jeff Garzik, one of the most respected developers in the Bitcoin community, described
    it as follows: “Satoshi published an open source system for the purpose that you
    didn’t have to know who he was, and trust who he was, or care about his knowledge.”
    The true spirit of open source makes it so that the code speaks for itself, without
    any intervention from the creator or programmer.'

    generals’ problem. The solution was generalized with components and ideas borrowed
    from the cypherpunk community. We briefly talk about three of those ideas and
    the components they provided for the complete Bitcoin protocol: Hashcash for proof
    of work, Byzantine fault tolerance for the decentralized network, and blockchain
    to remove the need for centralized trust or a central authority. Let’s dive into
    each one, starting with Hashcash.Hashcash was devised by Adam Black in the late
    1990s to limit e-mail spam with the first of its kind Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm.
    The rationale behind Hashcash was to attach some computational cost to sending
    e-mails. Spammers have a business model that relies on sending large numbers of
    e-mails with very little cost associated with each message. However, if there
    is even a small cost for each spam e-mail sent, that cost multiplies over thousands
    of e-mails, making their business unprofitable. Hashcash relies on the idea of
    cryptographic hash functions: A type of hash function (in the case of Bitcoin,
    SHA1) takes an input and converts it into a string that generates a message digest,
    as shown in Figure [1-2](#Fig2). The hash functions are designed to have a property
    called one-way functions, which implies that a potential input can be verified
    very easily through the hash function to match the digest, but reproducing the
    input from the digest is not feasible. The only possible method of re-creating
    the input is by using brute force to find the appropriate input string. In practice,
    this is the computationally intensive element of Hashcash and also eventually
    Bitcoin. This principle has become the foundation behind PoW algorithms powering
    Bitcoin today and most cryptocurrencies. The PoW for Bitcoin is more complex and
    involves new components, which we talk about at length in a later chapter.![A430562_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-2.Mechanism of a cryptographic hash function. It takes an input and consistently
    converts it to a string of an output digest.The next idea we need to discuss is
    the Byzantine generals’ problem. It is an agreement problem among a group of generals,
    with each one commanding a portion of the Byzantine army, ready to attack a city.
    These generals need to formulate a strategy for attacking the city and communicate
    it to each other adequately. The key is that every general agrees on a common
    decision, because a tepid attack by a few generals would be worse than a coordinated
    attack or a coordinated retreat. The crux of the problem is that some of the generals
    are traitorous. They might cast a vote to deceive the other generals and ultimately
    lead to a suboptimal strategy. Let’s take a look at an example: In a case of odd-numbered
    generals, say seven, three support attacking and three support retreat. The seventh
    general might communicate an agreement to the generals in favor of retreat, and
    an agreement to attack to the other generals, causing the whole arrangement to
    fall apart. The attacking forces fail to capture the city because no intrinsic
    central authority could verify the presence of trust among all seven generals.In
    this scenario, Byzantine fault tolerance can be achieved if all the loyal generals
    can communicate effectively to reach an undisputed agreement on their strategy.
    If so, the misleading (faulty) vote by the traitorous general would be revealed
    and fail to perturb the system as a whole. For the Bitcoin protocol, Nakamoto’s
    key innovation to enable Byzantine fault tolerance was to create a peer-to-peer
    network with a ledger that could record and verify a majority approval, thereby
    revealing any false (traitorous) transactions. This ledger provided a consistent
    means of communication and further allowed for removal of trust from the whole
    system. The ledger is also known as the blockchain, and by attaching blockchain
    to Bitcoin, it became the first digital currency to solve the double spending
    problem network-wide. In the remainder of this chapter, we present a broad overview
    of the broad overview of the technology, and the concept of a blockchain-enabled
    application.The blockchain is primarily a recording ledger that provides all involved
    parties with a secure and synchronized record of transactions from start to finish.
    A blockchain can record hundreds of transactions very rapidly, and has several
    cryptographic measures intrinsic to its design for data security, consistency,
    and validation. Similar transactions on the blockchain are pooled together into
    a functional unit called a block and then sealed with a timestamp (a cryptographic
    fingerprint) that links the current block to the one preceding it. This creates
    an irreversible and tamper-evident string of blocks connected together by timestamps,
    conveniently called a blockchain. The architecture of blockchain is such that
    every transaction is very rapidly verified by all members of the network. Members
    also contain an up-to-date copy of the blockchain locally, which allows for consensus
    to be reached within the decentralized network. Features such as immutable record-keeping
    and network-wide consensus can be integrated into a stack to develop new types
    of applications called decentralized apps (DApps). Let’s look at a prototype of
    a DApp in Figure [1-3](#Fig3), in the context of the Model-View-Controller (MVC
    ) framework.NoteThe first block of the blockchain is called the Genesis block.
    This block is unique in that it does not link to any blocks preceeding it. Nakmoto
    added a bit of historical information to this block as context for the current
    financial environment in the United Kingdom: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor
    on brink of second bailout for banks. “This block not only proves that no bitcoins
    existed before January 3, 2009, but also gives a little insight into the mind
    of the creators.![A430562_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg)Figure
    1-3.Simple prototype of a decentralized application that interacts with the end
    user at the final stepsThe model and controller here rely on the blockchain for
    data (data integrity and security) and accordingly update the view for the end
    user. The secret sauce in this prototype is the application programming interface
    (API), which works to pull information from the blockchain and provides it to
    the model and controller. This API provides opportunities to extend business logic
    and add it to the blockchain, along with basic operations that take blocks as
    input and provide answers to binary questions. The blockchain could eventually
    have more features, such as oracles that can verify external data and timestamp
    it on the blockchain itself. Once a decentralized app starts dealing with large
    amounts of live data and sophisticated business logic, we can classify it as a
    blockchain-enabled application.'
