    chewing glass and staring into the abyss.^([52](notes.html#ch00-fn52)) Today that
    seemed like an understatement.

    All our credit had been exhausted, and we were down to our last month of cash.
    Everything—the bank accounts, the business, the house—was on the line.

    owe us?” I pointed to the number on the spreadsheet.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say, purely for the sake of argument, that a client owes you $100,000.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The challenge of paying for services is that no one wants to pay up front. You
    hire a guy to do your roof, there’s no way you’re going to pay for the entire
    roof in advance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The usual solution is to pay at milestones: Let’s say 50 percent when the roof
    is half done, and 50 percent when the project is complete. But even this is not
    ideal, because the roofer can still get screwed on the last half. What’s he going
    to do if you don’t pay, tear the roof off that sucker?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution is a blockchain-based escrow system, like our balloon animal example
    but with a twist. You and the roofer enter into a smart contract, and you put
    in the entire cost of the roof up front. Right away this is a better system, because
    he knows you’re good for it. Psychologically you’re all in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let’s say there is disagreement. The roofer says the project is done, but
    you say the roof is leaking. The two of you go back and forth, but can’t come
    to an agreement. The $100,000 (it’s a big roof) sits in the smart contract, like
    escrow. You won’t release it, but you won’t get it back, either.

- en: Let’s say that this is all happening on a payment blockchain called TrustChain.
    When there’s disagreement on a payment, each party stakes a percentage they’re
    willing to pay for arbitration—in other words, how much you’re each willing to
    “give up” to resolve the dispute.

    money back as long as you don’t trash the room.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that staking percentage goes to a decentralized arbitration committee (i.e.,
    people who make a living from resolving TrustChain disputes). They work with the
    two of you to find a solution, and the members of the committee get paid the amount
    you’ve staked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, you stake 10 percent of the $100,000, and the roofer stakes 20
    percent (he has more to lose, as he’s already paid for the materials and labor).
    The arbitrators hear both sides of the story, view photos of the work, and review
    the roofer’s previous TrustChain feedback (42 positive ratings) and your feedback
    (you’re new). They rule in favor of the roofer, who’s paid $70,000, and the arbitrators
    split the $30,000 stake.
