- en: 'Chapter 4: Bitcoin and BlockchainWhat Is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is an intangible form
    of currency that exists on the internet. It is not centralized and therefore operates
    outside the parameters of local authorities and banks.There is a public ledger
    that documents all Bitcoin transactions and stores the data pertaining to them
    on servers known as nodes. These servers are located all over the world. Ownership
    of bitcoins can be verified across all servers.Bitcoin is kept in a virtual wallet
    and that can be accessed from a computer with an internet connection. Bitcoins
    can be divided by up to 7 decimal places. This means that you can buy or transact
    with as little as a thousandth or a hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. A thousandth
    is called a milli and a hundred millionth is called satoshi.What Is Bitcoin Mining?Because
    you cannot actually touch Bitcoin and it doesn’t get printed out like fiat money,
    it’s easy to be confused on where it comes from and how it’s ‘mined’.Simply put,
    they are mined out of the system. It is referred to as mining because, like other
    natural resources, there is a predefined amount of Bitcoin available. Technically,
    mining is adding the data from transactions onto a blockchain. Miners are vital
    to the network because they maintain the integrity of all payments and receipts.
    They use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems every ten minutes.
    Once the problem is solved, a block of all the latest confirmed transactions is
    added to the chain. Miners are rewarded a block of bitcoin for every problem they
    solve. The more miners there are, the faster transactions can be validated.The
    mathematical problem or ‘puzzle’ that miners have to solve is called Proof of
    Work (POW).Is It Safe to Buy?Because of Blockchain technology, having Bitcoin
    is safer than leaving your money in the bank. It’s no secret that banks tend to
    be corrupt and have had several banking catastrophes. Bitcoin cannot be forged
    and unless you share your wallet’s password, it''s virtually impossible for you
    to lose track of it.From the outside looking in, it may appear hard to buy Bitcoin,
    but it’s easier when you start looking into it. All you need is an internet connection,
    some ID and a cryptocurrency exchange account. On top of the exchange account,
    you should download an app that allows you to have a personal cryptocurrency wallet.
    This way, you can pay for your Bitcoin with a debit or credit card. Bitcoin is
    also attainable at niche ATMs and through Peer-to-peer exchanges. P2P forms part
    of a decentralized network. You can swap and share information and data with no
    intermediaries. You can engage in anonymous exchanges of currency in a safe and
    secure way.The Ins and Outs of the Bitcoin BlockchainThe bitcoin blockchain is
    an open ledger that is basically run by a network of unknown people. Historically,
    security models are based on concealing information and keeping people out. Bitcoin''s
    security model is based on letting people in. It works because of self-interest.
    Each user is so focused on gaining that they aren’t worried about what another
    user is doing. People can access shared and updated records without having to
    communicate with one another.If you are in possession of Bitcoin, you’re essentially
    in possession of a private key. A private key is one half of a digital signature
    that signifies that you own a Bitcoin. The other half of the key is public and
    is stored in the blockchain. Each block carries numerous transactions. Every transaction
    refers to a transaction that came before it.When you want to make a purchase using
    Bitcoin, your request is broadcast and that request is received by all the computers
    on the peer-to-peer network. The owners of these computers are called miners.
    Miners collect requests and put them into a block. They then run the latest block
    and its predecessor through hash functions. Each miner has ten minutes to solve
    a cryptographic puzzle. Once it’s solved, it gets added as the latest block at
    the end of the chain and the miner broadcasts it to their peers who verify it.
    The first miner to solve the puzzle gets rewarded with some Bitcoin.The main advantage
    of having miners is that it beefs up security. The puzzles that the miners solve
    increase in complexity each time. So, every time a new block is added on to the
    chain it acts as a barrier for the blocks before it. Trying to tamper with a block
    is not easy. If a person wants to tamper with one, they have to be fast enough
    to change the information in every block that comes after it too. This all has
    to happen before any updates are made to the chain.Because every miner is out
    to protect their own interests, the blockchain will always remain secure and functional.'
