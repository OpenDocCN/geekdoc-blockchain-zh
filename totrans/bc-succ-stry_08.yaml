    was the mid-1980s, the beginning of China’s industrial revolution, and change
    was in the air. The streets were buzzing with bicycles; the sky was crisscrossed

    life. For a young girl, the experience was dizzying and wonderful.

    of lack of opportunity.

    where they didn’t exist. After receiving her education from Cass Business School

    of what was inside, believing it would always be beyond their reach?

    ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, it was a *more efficient use of donations*—not only was there no overhead,
    but BCF also worked with local communities to develop solutions to their most
    pressing problems. Traditional charities—as well as government foreign aid programs—can
    fall into the trap of blindly sending money overseas, without working with locals
    to find out where resources would be most beneficial.^([5](ch08.html#ch01fn96))
    By engaging directly with the communities they were supporting, BCF could quickly
    test, refine, and scale its solutions to maximize their social impact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    them to participate in the new Internet of Value. Just as traditional foreign
    aid was designed to build goodwill for the donating country, BCF had a secondary
    goal of building goodwill around digital currencies. As in other areas of blockchain,
    simply providing technology isn’t enough; rather, the challenge is to get people
    using it in a positive way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, it *provided a new channel for donors to give*—and many of these donors
    were newly wealthy after the blockchain boom of 2017\. This had two interesting
    effects. Just as traditional charities will often take donations in stocks or
    bonds, BCF became the de facto standard for accepting digital assets. It also
    encouraged major industry players like Ripple and Zcash to send over large donations
    denominated in their own token. By accepting any digital asset (as opposed to,
    say, only its own token), BCF was able to quickly attract large donors, allowing
    the foundation to start from a position of financial strength.

    both the *technical* and *political* challenges of their work, handling “the code”
    and “the crowds” in equal measure. As with our other success stories, BCF’s first
    challenges required the skill of a programmer and the style of a politician.

- en: Transparency sounds great, but most traditional charities don’t really want
    to expand transparency beyond legal requirements. Transparency means that donors
    see how much money goes to operational costs and executive salaries—not to mention
    the endless cycle of your donations being spent to raise even more donations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This issue of transparency presented a problem for many charitable organizations
    that reached out to BCF for partnerships. Once they understood that blockchain
    represented a new level of transparency—as you can see literally every donation,
    on the shared ledger—these conversations often became difficult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another challenge of transparency was that everyone could see your every move,
    including your mistakes. Imagine your accountant having a team of people—in fact,
    the entire world—watching every transaction, and you get a sense of the new reality.

    the L-Istrina Campaign was sent to the wrong internal wallet. When the blockchain
    community called out the mistake, the funds were immediately sent back to BCF
    under the transaction “Adjustment to BCF” in the amount of 15,313.94 BNB.^([18](ch08.html#ch01fn109))
    This example illustrates that just because a blockchain transaction is permanent
    doesn’t mean that it can’t be “undone.” As with any accounting error, we can simply
    make an opposite or counterbalancing transaction. Fully transparent nonprofits,
    BCF learned, would need to quickly acknowledge and correct accounting errors.'

- en: Other members of the blockchain community called out BCF on why some donations
    were not immediately showing up on the blockchain. The foundation explained that
    donated funds weren’t shown on the blockchain until they were allocated to a charity.
    For example, the TRON blockchain project made a donation of $3 million, to be
    gradually allocated on a project-by-project basis.^([19](ch08.html#ch01fn110))
    These funds showed up only after they were committed to specific projects.

    may ask themselves. Does a public ledger lead to more rigorous accounting and
    therefore to more trust? Or does it lead to more questions from a skeptical public
    and consequently to less trust? The early BCF challenges show that blockchain
    accountants will need to practice scrupulous honesty and radical openness—especially
    about their mistakes.
