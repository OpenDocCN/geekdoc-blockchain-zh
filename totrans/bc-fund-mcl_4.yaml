    blockchain innovations that followed, are moving us from an ‘Internet of Information’
    to an ‘Internet of Value’ where people transact value, i.e., money and other assets,
    directly with each other. The pivot to an ‘Internet of Value’ requires innovative
    solutions to some very old problems—like double-spending, identity, credentials,
    bookkeeping and a medium of exchange (i.e., money!)—as well as to newer problems
    like cybercrime. Before blockchains, we rely on institutions to solve these problems.
    After blockchains, we rely on technologies like cryptography, distributed ledgers,
    digital assets, and smart contracts to solve these problems.

- en: So how would an ‘Internet of Value’ work for an average person? We can imagine
    a scenario where Alice is enjoying a visit to her favorite art museum and decides
    she would like two pints of fresh organic strawberries to be delivered to her
    smart refrigerator, which is located by her back door. She uses her phone to place
    the order and elects to pay with a stable coin—a cryptocurrency that is pegged
    to the US dollar—from her digital wallet. With one click, her order and payment
    option request is matched with a reliable supplier with available inventory, and
    with an authorized and available logistics operator. A smart contract is automatically
    generated to code the terms of the transaction for Alice, the supplier, and the
    logistics operator. The three parties authorize the agreement, either automatically
    or by human review, depending on their preferences. By authorizing the smart contract,
    Alice allows the smart contract to hold her payment to the supplier in escrow
    until the transaction is complete; she has also granted access rights for the
    logistics operator to verify the location and access code of her smart outdoor
    refrigerator. An hour later, a drone arrives at Alice’s smart outdoor refrigerator.
    The drone electronically unlocks the smart refrigerator with a one-time access
    key. Alice’s refrigerator scans the package, verifies receipt against the smart
    contract’s requirements, sends a receipt confirmation message to the smart contract,
    which then automatically releases the payment to the supplier’s digital wallet.
    Alice’s phone notifies her of the delivery and she is delighted to see exactly
    where and when the fruit was harvested, its certifications for organic and sustainable
    production, the temperature and pitstops during its entire journey through the
    supply chain, ending with its final delivery to her smart refrigerator. Meanwhile,
    the drone shuts the refrigerator, sends a message of successful delivery and requests
    instructions for its next flight plan. When Alice gets home, she enjoys her strawberries
    so much that she uses her digital wallet to tip the farmer. She also decides to
    give her supplier and drone operator top ratings for their services. In turn,
    the supplier awards her three tokens which she can redeem on future purchases.

- en: In this scenario, one can imagine that a number of applications are working
    behind the scenes, such as an e-commerce platform to match Alice’s order to the
    supplier and logistics operator; a food traceability application to track the
    strawberries from the farm to Alice’s refrigerator; a cold chain application that
    signals any temperature deviations and durations along its journey from the farm;
    a logistics application for scheduling and routing drones; a home appliance application
    for Alice’s refrigerator, a payments application using digital currencies, and
    a universal identity application to verify credentials and access rights for all
    of the individuals, organizations, and objects in this story. How realistic is
    this scenario? As of 2020, we have the components for each application in Alice’s
    story, but they are not yet scaled or interoperable. When the full vision for
    the ‘Internet of Value’ is realized, these applications will be interoperable,
    secure, confidential, trustworthy, and most importantly, decentralized—no one
    institution or government will own or control any of it. They will run on blockchain
    technologies.

    in a remarkably new way. Nakamoto—a pseudonym used by an unknown person or persons
    who remains anonymous to this day—imagined a world where people could safely,
    securely, and anonymously transfer value directly with each other (1) without
    using government-issued currencies; (2) without relying upon trusted third parties
    (TTPs) like banks; and (3) without the need to reconcile records across trading
    partners. His (or her) innovation is Bitcoin, described in a white paper posted
    to a cryptographic mailing list on October 31, 2008.^([6](#fn_6))

    people became increasingly distrustful of financial institutions. Movements like
    Occupy Wall Street ranted against wealth inequality and the influence of large
    financial institutions on government policy. People rallied against the government’s
    power to control money. Bitcoin has its roots in Libertarian and Cypherpunk values,
    which aim to create social and political change by circumventing governments and
    large financial institutions through privacy-enhancing technologies.^([7](#fn_7))

- en: Satoshi Nakamoto’s nine-page white paper specified the technical requirements
    for the ‘Internet of Value’. What’s remarkable is that Nakamoto used existing
    algorithms, but assembled them in a way to do something entirely new. Quite simply,
    Nakamoto proposed *“a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that] would
    allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going
    through a financial institution*.”^([8](#fn_8)) Bitcoin achieves this by tackling
    some very old problems with algorithms and behavioral incentives (See [Figure
    1.1](#f_1_1)). Let’s begin with the ‘double spend’ problem, the risk that value
    might be sent twice (or more).

    Instead, after the transfer of value is complete, the sender should no longer
    have the money, the recipient should. Today, a messy network of global financial
    systems and regulators prevent double spending. They also mitigate other counter-party
    risks—the risk each trading party bears that the other party will not fulfill
    its contractual obligations. Banks, credit card companies, money transmitters,
    notaries, lawyers, and other trusted third parties (TTPs) provide independent
    ‘truth attestations’ such as notarizing signatures; verifying identity; verifying
    ownership; authenticating assets; and attesting that agreements have been properly
    executed. TTPs provide these and many other vital services to facilitate trade
    (the advantages), for which they earn significant transaction fees (the major
    disadvantage). Transaction costs for remittances are typically about eight percent
    of the value of the transaction.^([9](#fn_9)) Before an ‘Internet of Value’, the
    process to transact value is expensive, and it is often opaque in that tracking
    transactions once they leave the boundaries of the firm can be difficult.

    some of the services normally done by TTPs, and by engaging a community to perform
    other services. For an automation example, Bitcoin (and many blockchain applications
    that followed) rely on cryptographic private-public key pair to verify account
    ownership; whoever is in possession of the private key is assumed to be the legitimate
    owner of the account (explained more deeply in [Chapter 3](chapter03.xhtml)).
    Validating transactions to prevent double spending was a bit trickier to solve
    without trusted third parties. Senders cannot be trusted to verify that they have
    enough cryptocurrency in their accounts to fund their transactions. An independent
    verifier is needed, but Nakamoto did not want to rely on traditional financial
    institutions to provide the validation. Here was Nakamoto’s brilliant solution:
    reward other people in the network (called ‘miners’)**^(([ii](#rfn_ii)))** with
    newly issued bitcoins to validate all the recently submitted transactions. The
    economic incentives of the Bitcoin network motivate validators to play by the

    every party manages its own systems of records (software and data, including ledgers)
    within the boundaries of the firm or relies on a TTP. Across firm boundaries,
    parties have to reconcile information about the transaction. Reconciliations are
    expensive and time-consuming. Once reconciled, there is nothing to prevent trading
    partners from modifying records after the fact; partners cannot be confident they
    are dealing with the same historical record of transactions through time. This
    is why we have millions of people with accounting skills working on processing
    everyday receipts and payables.

    to shared record keeping. The Bitcoin network maintains a digital ledger, called
    a *blockchain*, to serve as the universal bookkeeping record; no more need to
    reconcile records because every party agrees ‘this is what transpired’. The ledger
    is distributed to all the host computers (called nodes) that run the Bitcoin network.
    There were over 9,000 Bitcoin nodes as of December 2019, each with its own identical
    copy of the ledger.^([10](#fn_10)) The nodes in the Bitcoin network constantly
    chatter with each other to make sure no party tampers with the records after-the-fact.

    fuerte). People understand fiat currencies as a unit of measure. (To illustrate

    then ask them if 1 bitcoin for a loaf of bread is reasonable. What types of answers
    did you elicit?) However, fiat currencies have a number of disadvantages. Governments
    can print fiat money at will, causing inflation and can change regulations on
    a whim. Governments can also freeze, seize, or restrict access to one’s assets.^([13](#fn_13))

    The public blockchain community is filled with exciting startups, non-government

    is by invitation-only, and where only authorized members validate transactions.
    They see value coming from sharing blockchain-enabled systems with ecosystem partners,
    such as lower costs; better transaction visibility; faster settlement times; immutability
    and auditability of records; less vendor opportunism; and better cybersecurity.

    blockchains until public blockchain standards and technology mature enough to

    exchanges. Where did all these digital coins come from? How much are they worth?
    In this section, we explore the types of cryptocurrencies and the overall market
    value. Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency. David
    Chaum launched DigiCash in 1990—the first live cryptocurrency of significance.^([3](#fn_3))
    While an important breakthrough, DigiCash was centrally controlled in that the
    company’s system performed the validations. Nakamoto resurrected Chaum’s idea
    of blind digital signatures as a way to verify asset ownership, but this time
    with distributed validation.^([4](#fn_4)) After Bitcoin, a Cambrian explosion
    of new cryptocurrencies emerged on the market.

    altering the programming code, and launching a ‘fork’ (see [Glossary](glossary.xhtml))
    to Bitcoin. These are called ‘altcoins’ because they are alternatives to Bitcoin.
    Altcoins aimed to either improve on bitcoin, such as increasing data storage or
    decreasing settlement times, or to serve different purposes, such as funding a
    new platform.^([5](#fn_5)) Namecoin and litecoin—both launched in 2011—are two
    early examples. ***Namecoin*** was designed by the Bitcoin community as a way
    to register names on the Bitcoin blockchain. One of its unique features is that
    Namecoin merged mining functions of Bitcoin and Namecoin to allow simultaneous
    mining of both coins, instead of making miners choose between the two. ***Litecoin***
    was created by Charlie Lee to improve Bitcoin’s settlement times by a factor of
    four; Litecoin creates a new block every 2.5 minutes instead of every ten minutes,
    as Bitcoin does. Its money supply is 84 million litecoins, which is four times
    greater than Bitcoin’s money supply. Most notably, it uses a different hashing
    algorithm (‘Scrypt’ rather than SHA-256), which at the time was designed to allow
    miners to mine litecoin without the need for specialized hardware.^([6](#fn_6))
    Readers will learn about mining and hashing in the next chapter.

    on Bitcoin’s digital ledger. The identities of the public address holders are
    not known, except to the two parties of the transaction. However, one of the parties
    may follow all of the subsequent transactions associated with the addresses, which
    is why Bitcoin is considered to be ‘pseudo-anonymous’. Several cryptocurrencies
    were developed to increase anonymity even more than Bitcoin. These so called ‘privacy
    coins’ include monero and zcash. ***Monero***, launched in 2015, is a cryptocurrency
    with increased data obfuscation compared to Bitcoin using ring signatures and
    stealth addresses.^([7](#fn_7)) ***Zcash*** is another major privacy coin, launched
    in 2016\. Designed by professors from Johns Hopkins, MIT, Technion, and Tel Aviv
    University, Zcash uses a cryptographic zero-knowledge proof which allows users
    to mask their addresses.^([8](#fn_8)) [Chapter 8](chapter08.xhtml) will cover

    to Bitcoin by pegging the coin to a stable asset outside of the network, such
    as pegging a digital coin to a fiat currency or to commodity like gold or a barrel
    of oil. ***Tether*** was the first stablecoin, launched in 2014, by a company
    called Tether Limited. Buyers exchange one US dollar for one tether coin, with
    Tether Limited allegedly storing each US dollar in a bank reserve.**^(([i](#rfn_i)))**
    Cryptotraders use tethers to take advantage of the price arbitrage across cryptocurrency
    exchanges; they can buy cryptocurrencies at a lower price with tethers on one
    exchange without having to first withdraw fiat currency from another exchange.^([9](#fn_9))

    and Circle—launched the coin as part of a consortium, promising transparency over
    its US dollar reserve management.^([10](#fn_10)) ***Gemini*** was founded by Cameron
    and Tyler Winklevoss; the gemini coin is another 1-to-1 peg with the US dollar.^([11](#fn_11))
    JP Morgan uses its ***JPM Coin*** to facilitate institution-to-institution transfers;
    it is also pegged to the US dollar. When one JP Morgan client sends money to another
    JP Morgan client over the blockchain, it uses the digital coin to speed settlement
    times, which are immediately redeemed for US dollars.^([12](#fn_12)) ***Libra***,
    the new token proposed by Facebook, will be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies
    (or perhaps to a local currency) and will be managed by the Libra Association,
    a non-profit membership organization based in Switzerland.^([13](#fn_13)) The
    US Congress has fiercely questioned Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and David

    Whales can sell a large enough portion of their bitcoins at a lower than market
    price to prompt a panic sell-off, which lowers the price further.^([27](#fn_27))

    was to become a miner and to manage one’s own digital wallet, which requires significant
    technical skills. Many people saw the need for an exchange where users could easily
    buy and sell bitcoins with fiat currency. The first Bitcoin exchange was ***Bitcoin
    Market***, launched in March of 2010 by a Bitcoin Talk member using the pseudonym
    ‘dwdollar’.^([57](#fn_57)) Jed McCaleb (born in Little Rock Arkansas), soon after
    launched the most famous Bitcoin exchange called ***Mt. Gox*** in 2010\. McCaleb
    sold the site to Mark Karpelès in 2011\. Early exchanges operated under the radar
    of regulatory bodies, and many consumers were at risk for shams and heists. Mt.
    Gox—and other exchanges that followed—were lucrative targets for hackers because
    exchanges controlled the users’ private keys. One of the largest heists occurred
    in August of 2014 when 850,000 bitcoins worth $450 million was stolen from the
    wallets managed by Mt. Gox.^([58](#fn_58))

    Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements. For example, Coinbase had money transmitter
    licenses from 45 US States and a New York State Virtual Currency License by 2019\.
    Coinbase also has commercial criminal insurance that is greater than the value

    level, the US Treasury Department was one of the first regulators to enact a cryptocurrency
    policy. In 2013, it classified Bitcoin as a convertible, decentralized, virtual
    currency, and therefore subject to property taxes. Subsequently, the Internal
    Revenue Service (IRS) treats cryptocurrencies as property for Federal income tax
    purposes. People must report gains or losses on their US tax returns.^([102](#fn_102))

    (SEC) has intervened on a number of ICOs. It’s useful to understand how the SEC
    guides its rulings. The SEC applies the ‘Howey Test’ to determine whether an investment
    is considered a security and thus subject to SEC regulations. The ‘Howey Test’
    comes from a 1946 Supreme Court case where the SEC sued the Howey Company of Florida.
    The Howey Company was a citrus farm that leased land to raise investment funds,
    but it did not register transactions with the SEC. The Supreme Court deemed that
    the transactions were indeed securities based on a four-part test. A transaction
    is considered a security investment if: (1) it includes an investment of money
    (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profit (4) based solely
    on the efforts of a promoter or third party. Based on this test, mostly all new
    investments in cryptocurrencies are now viewed as securities.^([103](#fn_103))

    US State laws are quite controversial. One notable example was a regulation published
    in June of 2015 by the Department of Financial Services (DFS) for New York State,
    which required companies to get a BitLicense for virtual currencies. Many small
    firms found compliance to be too expensive (or too invasive) and stopped operating
    in the state. A further controversy happened when the chief architect of the regulation,
    Benjamin Lawsky, left the DFS to start his own consulting process to help clients
    maneuver through the onerous process to obtain a BitLicense.^([107](#fn_107))
    The arguments for regulations are reasonable—the BitLicense, for example, required
    companies to: store transaction receipts; disclose risks; publish a customer complaint
    policy; maintain a cybersecurity program; hire a compliance officer; and abide
    by anti-money-laundering rules.^([108](#fn_108)) For startups, complying with
    such regulations can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, prompting them to
    establish their businesses in other US states with more welcoming regulations.

    Chinese patent applications were filed overseas, whereas 43 percent of 521,802
    US patent applications were filed overseas.^([131](#fn_131)) Perhaps US organizations

    business; risk factors; financial data; organizational structure; subsidiaries;
    and management’s discussion and analysis about the financial and operational results.
    Because it is regulated by the SEC, audited by an independent auditor, and scrutinized
    by market participants, such as analysts and institutional investors, the 10-K
    is perceived as a credible report and source of information on the operations
    and financial performance of the firm. Given its inherent credibility compared
    to, say, a marketing campaign; social media post; or talk at a technology conference,

    phase**, a few early successes garner even more attention. Senior executives start
    to take notice, new entrants jump into the market, and the technology may be viewed
    as a silver bullet, i.e. something that promises to instantly solve a longstanding
    problem. Many organizations start testing the technology, but enter the **trough
    of disillusionment phase** when instant success is not achieved. Organizations
    regroup. They learn to apply sound project management, change management, and
    what we call ‘action principles’ to deliver successful applications. In other
    words, it’s hard work to get value from a new innovation. As time passes, upgraded
    versions of the technology are released, the market producers consolidate, and
    organizational consumers learn how to gain value from the innovations. Gartner
    calls this the **slope of enlightenment phase**. The last phase, called the **plateau
    of productivity phase**, sees market maturity, widespread adoption, and integration
    into the enterprises’ standard technology portfolios.

    the five phases. In 2015, blockchains were not yet on Gartner’s map. However,
    by July of 2016, Gartner placed blockchains as past the ‘technology trigger phase’
    and was indeed approaching the apex of the ‘peak of inflated expectations phase’.
    A year later in July 2017, Gartner placed blockchains as nearly finished with
    that phase; blockchains were headed for the ‘trough of disillusionment’. A year
    later, the market hadn’t budged. Finally, by September of 2019, Gartner placed
    blockchain technologies as near the bottom of the trough. Gartner estimated that
    more than 90 percent of enterprise blockchain platform implementations will fail
    or need to be replaced. This is due to a fragmented blockchain market and ‘unrealistic
    expectations’.^([136](#fn_136)) Gartner predicted that blockchains would not reach
    of the ‘plateau of productivity’ until after 2022.

    First, it is a useful tool for discussing overall global trends, but industries
    and specific organizations within industries adopt technologies at different rates.
    For example, companies like EY, IBM, Microsoft, and Walmart had already reached
    the slope of enlightenment by 2019\. Second, the pace of adoption is not deterministic;
    individuals and organizations do not just sit around and wait for the future,
    they actively create it. Third, blockchains comprise a variety of technologies
    and sub-markets, and some are more mature than others. In 2019, Gartner decomposed
    the blockchain market into 37 different technologies, and placed these on the
    hype cycle.**^(([iv](#rfn_iv)))** It shows that exchanges and cryptocurrencies
    are more mature than stablecoins and fiat digital currencies (like China plans
    to do). It also shows that financial services and governments are ahead of advertising
    and customer service industries.

    traditional enterprises, blockchain working groups, standard-making bodies and

    Saberhagen, that defined an algorithm with increased data obfuscation compared
    to Bitcoin. With Monero, a recipient’s address is only used once, so that the
    sender cannot trace subsequent transactions on the ledger. When the recipient
    spends money out of that address (thus becoming a “sender” address in a subsequent
    transaction), the address gets hidden within a group signature [https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf](https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf);

    peer-to-peer payments. Bitcoin achieved this by tackling some very old—and new—problems
    with algorithms and behavioral incentives. Specifically, we learned that Bitcoin
    shifted (1) from government-issued currencies to a cryptocurrency; (2) from trusted
    third parties (TTPs) to automated and community-driven, counter-party risk mitigation;
    and (3) from party-level record keeping to shared record keeping.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s use a simple scenario to compare how parties transact before and after
    a blockchain application so we can better understand blockchain’s potential business
    value. Suppose four enterprises transact with each other (see left side of [Figure
    3.1](#f_3_1)). The four trading partners mitigate counter-party risks by engaging
    a trusted third party to provide truth attestations; that is, to verify information
    about the parties, assets, and transactions. The trusted third parties **provide
    vital services to facilitate trade**; that is why our four trading parties rely
    upon them. The TTP provides **clear control and accountability**. The trading
    parties have an identifiable institution to address questions, concerns, or complaints.
    Additionally, trading partners **can alter agreements** as new information becomes
    available, or as circumstances change. However, the TTP can command significant
    fees for such services. Let’s assume the four trading parties pay, on average,
    five percent of the value of each transaction to the TTP for these services. As
    a benchmark, in more complex scenarios, like remittances and global supply chains,
    **transaction costs can be high—**between eight and 22 percent of the value of
    the transaction.^([4](#fn_4))

- en: In our simple scenario in [Figure 3.1](#f_3_1), each party maintains its own
    systems to record debits, credits, and other data on their private ledgers (represented
    by different patterned database icons). Each party benefits from **controlling
    their own software and ledgers**; each enterprise can swiftly and unilaterally
    execute decisions within the boundaries of the firm. Each firm can modify its
    records and alter its software as it sees fit. Issues that arise, such as the
    discovery of a software bug or an attack on the network, can be dealt with immediately.
    Records can be modified when errors are discovered. However, the very essence
    of trade is *inter-organizational*; the setup that functions well within the boundaries
    of the firm often functions very poorly across firm boundaries. Among the four
    trading partners and one TTP in our scenario, there are five **versions of the
    truth,** which need to be reconciled. Even after reconciliation, nothing prevents
    a party from re-writing history after-the-fact. Because **each party can modify
    its own records**, partners cannot be confident they are dealing with the same
    historical record of transactions through time, thus hindering the ability to
    uniformly trace the origin of an assett and every change to its status over time
    (called ‘data provenance’). **Reconciliations, in turn, slow settlement times**.
    Let’s conservatively assume it takes 24 hours to settle transactions in our simple
    ecosystem. In a more realistic scenario such as trade finance, the knotwork of
    players involved—customers, suppliers, banks, customs, transporters, and warehouses—may
    take weeks to settle transactions.^([5](#fn_5))

    see the transactions coming in and out of its own organization—the rest are opaque.
    Each party has to work with the trusted third party to assess the status of a
    transaction. In more complex scenarios, some parties spend days or weeks tracking
    down the status of a transaction. Consider cross-border payments; when a manufacturer
    in one country sends payment to a supplier in another country, the manufacturer
    and the supplier’s financial institutions, national payment systems, and corresponding
    banks, process the transaction. Parties to an exchange have no access to the status
    of the transaction, the fees being charged, or even which institution controls
    a transaction as it works its way through the knot of interlocking relationships.
    The threat of ‘vendor opportunism’—the idea that vendors may pursue their self-interests
    with guile; may withhold information; or may not comply with the terms and conditions
    of the agreement—always exists.^([6](#fn_6)) Therefore, trading partners **spend
    a lot of resources monitoring agreements** to make sure that trading partners
    are behaving as promised.

    routinely turn over much of their personal data—including national identification
    numbers; home addresses; credit card numbers; birth dates; employment records;
    utility bills and more—simply to verify their identities to the institutions that
    sit in the middle of their transactions. **The risks of information leakage and
    identity theft are high**, as any partner might use the data for something other
    than the original transaction.^([7](#fn_7))

    their IT perimeters against cybersecurity attacks. Think of it as **brute force
    cybersecurity defense**. In reality, large enterprises successfully fend off thousands
    of cybersecurity threats each day. However, a single security breach can cost
    an organization billions of dollars to remedy. High profile attacks include Heartland
    Payment Systems in 2009, which cost the company $2.8 billion to remedy; Citibank
    in 2011, which cost $19.4 million; and JP Morgan Chase in 2014, which cost $1
    billion.^([8](#fn_8)) Think also about the security breaches at Equifax, Target,
    Sony, and Netflix—the list goes on.

    records and relies on trusted third parties to provide truth attestations. The
    trusted third parties add significant value, and parties like having control over
    their own data, but the entire setup prompts disputes; requires onerous reconciliations;
    commands high transaction fees; provides little transaction transparency; is slow
    to settlement transactions; and creates cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Blockchain
    applications aim to overcome these limitations.

    the same four parties could transact if they decide to share a blockchain application.
    Each party would agree to operate an independent computer node in the network.
    Each independent node would run the same software and maintain an identical copy
    of the digital ledger. The nodes would constantly chatter with each other to make
    sure no party tampered with the records. If anyone cheats, the other nodes will
    ignore or banish it.
  prefs: []

- en: One notes that after a shared blockchain application, there is no need for a
    trusted third party; instead, the blockchain application uses cryptography and
    computer algorithms to perform truth attestations. This allows **trading partners
    to transact directly**. While the parties will have to figure out a way to pay
    for and to govern the shared software, the overall **transaction costs should
    be lower** by eliminating the TTP. For now, we will assume the four players still
    rely on fiat currencies, but their blockchain application will have some form
    of native digital asset, such as a token to represent physical items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Transactions are only added to the ledger if they are valid; it’s a confirm-before-commit
    process instead of post-then-confirm-later process. As such, parties can rely
    on **one version of the truth**, so there is **no need for reconciliations**,
    enabling **faster settlement times.** The transactions can settle in sub-second
    to sixty minutes, depending on which consensus algorithm is used in the blockchain
    application. With one **transparent**, shared version of the truth, parties of
    an exchange can instantly determine the status of a transaction by reading the
    ledger. Furthermore, transactions on the shared distributed ledger are **immutable**,
    thus every party can be confident they are always dealing with the same historical
    data, guaranteeing consistent **data provenance**. Rather than solely rely on
    paper contracts, verbal agreements or handshakes, parties can rely on **smart
    contracts** that automatically execute the terms of agreements without oversight.
    No more monitoring and worrying that trading partners are not fulfilling their
    obligations. Moreover, consumers and institutions **control their own identity**
    with cryptographic digital signatures, reducing the risks of information leakage
    and identity theft. Furthermore, blockchain applications promise **heightened
    security**. Blockchain applications still function properly even if a high percentage
    of nodes are faulty—or even malicious—enabling fault tolerance, resiliency and
    100 percent availability. In theory, the only way to break a blockchain application
    is to commandeer more than 50 percent of the nodes. Distributed software offers
    quite a bounty of business value!

    third party, the risk profile will be altered—to whom does one complain or seek
    remediations from in cases of fraud or malicious acts? Smart contracts are only
    reliable if the terms and conditions can be explained, but in a world filled with
    uncertainty and ambiguity, coded agreements are not always possible. Parties will
    need to agree to unambiguous interpretations of data and event standards. Shared
    software and data require shared governance, and it is challenging to coordinate
    changes among many partners. Some of these downsides can be alleviated with good
    governance models and sound action principles, which are discussed at length in
    subsequent chapters. [Table 3.1](#t_3_1) summarizes the advantages and disadvantages

    interfaces (see [Figure 3.2](#f_3_2)). As one becomes more familiar with blockchain
    technologies, one appreciates that protocols are the real innovations in the space.
    **Protocols** specify rights of access and the rules for how transactions in a
    blockchain application authenticate asset ownership and how transactions are structured;
    addressed; transmitted; routed; validated; sequenced; secured; and added to the
    permanent record. ***A blockchain protocol is often called a ‘trust protocol’***.
    ***However, the word ‘trust’ is narrowly defined to mean: ‘trust that the records
    on the distributed ledger agree across copies.’*** Trust here has nothing to do
    with the faith or confidence that trading partners are benevolent or will play
    by the rules. In fact, it is more accurate to say that we can assume many actors
    will indeed be malevolent. ‘Trust’ equates to trust that the computer algorithms
    will reject faulty transactions, ignore faulty nodes on the network, and never
    modify the valid transactions once they have been added to the ledger. For a given
    blockchain application, protocols serve as the blueprints to ensure the correctness
    and ongoing integrity of records. In general, blockchain protocols define the
    rules for the distributed ledger; participation and validation; native digital
    assets; cryptography; consensus (to make sure everyone has the identical copy
    of the ledger); and smart contracts. Once rules are established, protocols are
    programmed into **code bases**, like Ethereum; EOS; Hyperledger Fabric; Corda;
    Quorum; Chain; or MultiChain. From there, a code base can be adapted for a particular
    **use case**, like tracking items in a supply chain or for cross-border payments.
    Finally, all blockchain applications have **interfaces** where users access the
    system. We’ll begin with distributed ledger protocols.'

    is a ***chain of block***s—hence the name ‘blockchain’ (see [Figure 3.3](#f_3_3)).
    With a blockchain structure, recently approved transactions are sequenced and
    collected into a block. Each block comprises a header and a payload of transactions.
    The block header includes a pointer to the previous block of transactions, forming
    a chain of sequenced blocks over time, all the way back to the first block, called
    the ‘genesis block’. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric structure
    their digital ledgers as blockchains.

    Their ledgers are more complex than Bitcoin’s ledger because they maintain account
    settings, balances, trustlines and different types of transactions like sell offers,
    payments, and cancel offers. The account balances are updated with the most recent
    set of validated transactions. [Figure 3.4](#f_3_4) shows how a ledger gets updated.

    nodes in the blockchain network. The rights of participation and validation may
    vary by stakeholder type.

    or must be selected/voted upon to run a validator node). However, there are nuances;
    EOS, for example, distinguishes between node validators—which anyone may run—and
    block producers, which must be voted upon by the community. Permissionless blockchains
    need strong incentives to attract independent, ‘well-behaved’ validator nodes.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum incentivize good behavior by awarding cryptocurrencies to
    miners. Many permissioned blockchains have participants take turns validating
    the next set of transactions to the digital ledger. Plotting these two dimensions

    source code and turning on the mining function. (Although Bitcoin miners need
    specialized Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware to mine competitively).

    However, only 21 ‘block producers’ can add blocks. The owners of EOS cast votes
    for block producers in proportion to their stake.^([13](#fn_13)) The validator
    nodes with the most votes become a ‘delegate’. The algorithm takes turns selecting
    a leader from among the panel of delegates for a current time period. After the
    time period elapses, another round of voting occurs to select the next panel of
    delegates.^([14](#fn_14)) Delegates are rewarded with transaction fees. Blocks
    are produced about every 500 milliseconds, with each of the 21 producers getting
    a turn. On the day of writing this, nine block producers were located in China;
    three in Singapore; and one or two in the Cayman Islands, BVI, Hong Kong, Japan,
    Ukraine, and the United States.

    create a unique and secure transaction ID; transaction IDs within a block are
    hashed together multiple times to produce a Merkle Root (see [Glossary](glossary.xhtml))

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    generates a unique pair of numbers that are mathematically related, called a private-public
    key pair. The public key is the address we see stored on the blockchain (well
    actually, it’s a hashed version of the public key). The private key is stored
    off the blockchain, most typically in a digital wallet. To move value out of the
    address stored on the blockchain, one needs to verify he or she owns the address
    by using his or her private key, stored off the blockchain. Computer algorithms
    verify that the private key is indeed the mathematical mate to the public key.
    Both keys are needed to digitally sign the transaction (see [Figure 3.10](#f_3_10)).
    Thus, a blockchain uses digital signatures to verify asset ownership and thus
    does not need to rely on a trusted third party to provide this function.

    of transactions and blocks and guarantees the integrity and consistency of the
    blockchain across geographically distributed nodes.”*^([36](#fn_36)) Many consensus
    protocols have been proposed, including Proof-of-Work; Proof-of-Stake; Proof-of-Activity
    (which combines Proof-of-Stake with Proof-of-Work); Proof-of-Authority; Proof-of-Burn;
    Proof-of-Capacity; Proof-of-Elapsed Time; Proof-of-Listening; and Proof-of-Luck—the

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although consensus protocols vary in their validation procedures, in general,
    all consensus protocols seek to verify legitimate transactions, reject unverifiable
    transactions, ignore faulty nodes on the network, and prevent modifications to
    the ledger. The process of validation begins when a new transaction is broadcast
    to the network. Computer algorithms on the other nodes verify legitimate ownership
    of the asset (based on the owner’s digital signature with his or her private key)
    and check that the asset has not been given away before by scanning the digital
    ledger, thus preventing double spending. Which node gets to collect verified transactions,
    sequence them and add them to the official ledger depends on the network’s specific
    consensus protocol.

    on trusted third parties. Nakamoto proposed to reward other nodes in the network
    with newly issued bitcoins when they validate all recently submitted transactions
    and create the next block. So that validator nodes take the task seriously, Nakamoto
    proposed a competition among computer nodes in the blockchain network to be the
    first to collect recently verified transactions into a block and then to find
    an acceptable block identification number (known as the blockhash) for the next
    block in the blockchain. It’s not easy to find an acceptable number—it takes a
    lot of computing power to perform the brute force guesses to find a hash number
    that is less than the current mining ‘difficulty’ (see [Glossary](glossary.xhtml)
    for details). The difficulty is part of the proof that the miner’s computer did
    a significant amount of work to earn the block reward. The Proof-of-Work protocol
    creates a highly secure ledger, as an attacker would need to gain control of more
    than 50 percent of the nodes, rewrite history and find all new hashes that adhere
    to the protocol before other nodes notice. The cons of the protocol include slower
    transaction settlement times and higher electricity consumption compared to other
    protocols.

- en: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus protocol created by Sunny King and Scott
    Nadal, in a 2012 white paper.^([44](#fn_44)) Instead of ‘mining’ for coins, the
    protocol selects a member to ‘forge’ new currency as a reward for validating the
    transactions and creating the next block. (In other versions of the protocol,
    there is no ‘forging’ of new coins; the selected member node is awarded only transaction
    fees paid by senders.) The member node is selected in a semi-random way. It’s
    called a ‘proof-of-stake’ because the members with the highest ‘stake’ (e.g. have
    the largest account balances; holding the coins the longest period of time) are
    giving priority in the selection algorithm. Participants in the blockchain can
    estimate with some certainty which member will likely be the next ‘forger’. A
    Proof-of-Stake process uses much less energy than a Proof-of-Work process. It
    creates a highly secure ledger, as an attacker would need to gain control of more
    than 50 percent of the cryptocurrency to rewrite the ledger. However, critics
    claim it is less secure than proof-of-work because people with small stakes have
    little to lose by voting for multiple blockchain histories, which leads to consensus
    never resolving.^([45](#fn_45)) Peercoin and Nxt use Proof-of-Stake. [Figure 3.11](#f_3_11)

    from the member list is selected as leader (see [Figure 3.12](#f_3_12)). A client
    node sends a request to the leader node to validate a transaction. The leader
    node multicasts the request to all the other authorized nodes. The authorized
    nodes execute the request independently and then send to each other and reply
    to the client. The client waits for a certain percentage of replies to confirm
    validation, typically waiting for 2/3 of the nodes to agree. The leader node then
    changes for next round.

    the contract and then executes the terms*.”^([47](#fn_47)) Anything that can be
    coded with clearly specified rules, can be coded into a smart contract, which
    is secured and permanently stored on a blockchain. Ethereum was the first major
    blockchain to include full smart contracting capabilities, thus escalating blockchains
    from peer-to-peer payment systems to platforms that can execute machine-to-machine
    agreements. As of January 2020, over 1,000,000 contracts were running on Ethereum,
    but many of these are simple little contracts such as ‘hello world’.^([48](#fn_48))

    and cannot be stopped. Therefore, parties must agree to all the terms of the contract
    before deploying it. Smart contracts are commonly used to automatically move value
    around accounts based on agreed upon conditions. As we shall see, use cases abound:
    lotteries; voting; crowdsourcing; asset sharing (lookout Uber, Airbnb, and Spotify);
    asset tracking; identity management; bidding; rating; gaming; and gambling. In

    A lottery is a good example. A smart contract for a lottery could define the time
    period when people could send value to the smart contract account to buy lottery
    tickets. The smart contract could specify how the winning lottery number would
    be selected, perhaps by taking the hash of a randomly selected block and awarding
    the account that is closest to that number as the winner. The smart contract could
    automatically transfer the money to the winning account. If the lottery was regulated,
    the smart contract could be coded to deduct taxes.

    odds could also be mechanized in the contract. However, smart contracts for horse
    racing cannot run autonomously; they need outsiders (called ‘***oracles***’) to
    inform the smart contract of the winning animal. Unlike trusted third parties,

    and permanently storing transactions on a shared ***distributed ledger***. ***Digital
    assets***, native to each blockchain application, exist only in digital form and
    come with rights of use. ***Cryptography*** and ***consensus*** algorithms are
    used to validate transactions, to update the ledger, and to keep the ledger and
    network secure. Most blockchains also use ***smart contracts*** that apply rules
    to automatically execute transactions based upon pre-agreed conditions.
