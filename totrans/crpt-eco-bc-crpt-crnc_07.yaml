    this reason, it is often associated with the idea of globalization. We know from
    even the most cursory glance at history that every major technological innovation
    makes the world smaller. The most recent culprit was the Internet, which made
    the world smaller by bringing people together in exciting new ways. I believe
    that the application of blockchain to finance will bring humans even closer to
    one another. It will also, in my opinion, unleash revolutionary positive changes
    onto society.

    already seen the powerful benefits it can bring into our lives. These include
    cross-border payment capability, early capital raising, and improvements to securities.
    The applications of blockchain and cryptocurrency are challenging the existing
    financial market. The attitudes about how quickly to adopt new technologies vary
    from country to country. So in this chapter, I’d like to shine a little light
    on blockchain innovations in different countries around the world.

    minded people. Today, it is also emerging as the place for crypto innovation in
    Europe. People in finance have long known that Switzerland is an effective place
    to grow new businesses, because it pairs a stable infrastructure with financial
    expertise and resources. Finance is the main industry in Switzerland, and the
    Swiss have one of the highest average incomes of any country in Europe. According
    to the WEF 2015 report, Switzerland ranks at the very top when it comes to global
    economic competitiveness. These factors combine to make Switzerland one of the
    most attractive countries for blockchain and cryptocurrency developers.

    is also the reason why its government seems to be comfortable with supporting
    financial decentralization. The government of Switzerland has been actively involved
    in fostering the evolution of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Zug, a small city
    in Switzerland, has even embraced the nickname “Crypto Valley.” Outsiders are
    generally aware of the extent to which Switzerland provides robust financial services
    to clients (and also respects their privacy), but it is fast gaining a reputation
    as a place where decentralized financial tools can grow. The probusiness environment,
    lack of regulation, and low tax rates in this country have attracted many entrepreneurs
    and high-end professionals. Perhaps it should be no surprise that Switzerland
    is now considered to be “the nest” for new innovations in blockchain. Ethereum’s
    headquarters is located in Zug, and many lesser known cryptos are joining it there.

    as payment. As one of the active early adopters of blockchain and cryptocurrency,
    Zug began allowing residents to pay for city services with cryptos back in 2016\.
    But the city hasn’t stopped there. They are also exploring the real-life application
    of blockchain in other areas, such as government. Voting in Zug was already possible
    via mail, the Internet, or at polling stations. But the city recently allowed
    residents to take part in a blockchain-based vote-casting test. The potential
    of broader use of blockchain is being realized here in a very real way.

    launch of ICOs. Because the headquarters of Ethereum is in the country, the standard
    for an ICO is commonly accepted as ERC-20\. Switzerland saw this opportunity and
    grasped it at the very earliest stages the industry. The results speak for themselves.
    So far, of the eleven biggest ICO launches of all time, four have taken place
    in Switzerland. In 2017, capital raised through ICOs in Switzerland surpassed
    $550 million USD and represented 14 percent of total ICO capital raised globally.

    private banking industry, and some worried that crypto could exacerbate this.
    In order to catch up with the increasing popularity of ICOs—while preserving security
    and preventing fraud—in early 2018, the national Financial Market Supervisory
    Authority (FINMA) clarified some key rules regarding regulating ICOs and tokens.
    According to the new rules, there can be only three types of tokens, and each
    token is limited to its own function. The goal of this clarification is to help
    investors make wise decisions and prevent the intentional dissemination of confusing
    information.

    exchanges to close within the month. The government-mandated ordered shutdown
    rattled crypto markets all over the globe. One by one, exchanges closed. Both
    Huobi and OKcoin decided to leave China in order to survive elsewhere. They worked
    with Chinese regulators to do this in a legal manner and started transferring
    the services to overseas providers like Huobi Pro and Okex.

    Token sales and the trading of small cryptocurrencies—as opposed to major ones
    such as Bitcoin—have become increasingly popular among Chinese investors. As I
    noted in the previous chapter, in sharp contrast to major cryptocurrencies, small
    cryptocurrencies are relatively easy to manipulate. Small individual investors
    flooded into the secondary market, hungry for these currencies. After Huobi and
    OKcoin were shut down, Binance stepped in to fill the void. Within half a year,
    Binance became the largest exchange in China.

    However, when the government’s iron hand forced major exchanges to leave, it changed
    everything. Globally, the price of Bitcoin dropped from about $4,300 to about
    $3,300\. But by the end of 2017, the price of Bitcoin had bounced back to almost
    $20,000 before falling again. To me, this just further proves that cryptocurrency
    is capable of decentralization. It will evolve when it needs to. The survival
    ability of cryptocurrency—and the whole set of industries surrounding it—is just
    remarkable. And it is only getting stronger. Opportunities are continuing to grow.

    for major transfers as a safeguard against money laundering and terrorism. Harsher
    standards have also been put in place for exchanges that disobey the law. Exchanges
    also have to register with the FSA (the Financial Services Agency of Japan). The

    and verify the number of employees. The FSA has granted licenses to sixteen cryptocurrency
    exchanges so far.

    will be distributed at the outset of the ICO. The template also includes new rules
    for tracking the progress of an ICO, for confirming the identity of buyers, and
    for eliminating insider trading. The Japanese public generally seems to see these

    mainstream financial system through sophisticated supervision and careful regulation.

    virtual currency market. Because of this, most investors in virtual currency are
    simply private individuals. There are a couple of reasons why crypto is so hot
    in South Korea. One is that South Korea is among the most advanced digital economies
    in the world, and among the most technologically advanced. Digital currency has
    found its natural habitat in South Korea. Because of their enthusiasm for all
    things high tech, investing in cryptocurrency is second nature for South Koreans.
    The other reason for this popularity is probably the high yield that can be realized
    through investing in cryptocurrency. The success of Ethereum, for example, has
    been a big story in the South Korean media.

    of using virtual accounts, users have to trade through bank accounts to verify
    their identities. So far, six banks have stepped up to offer virtual currency
    accounts. And to avoid being left out, the top four crypto exchanges have moved
    to real-name accounts. (These include Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit.) Not
    everybody likes the “real-name rule,” and many see it as something hampering the

    Malta approved three regulatory bills designed to encourage crypto adoption. The
    bills are the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act, the Innovative Technological
    Arrangement and Services Act, and the Virtual Financial Asset Act. These new laws
    are designed to provide clear regulation for companies using blockchain technologies
    in a way that will encourage innovation. It’s a move designed to lure crypto companies
    and blockchain startups to the island—and it’s working. Malta’s low tax rate probably

    it is now also a very blockchain-friendly country. And in addition to ICOs, Singapore
    has emerged as a harbor for blockchain startups. The government is encouraging
    companies to come there to innovate in blockchain technology. Distinguishing it
    further from Malta, Singapore also has a very well-established financial infrastructure.

    goals is to encourage people to participate in transactions without third-party
    overseers. Despite these lofty ambitions, virtual currency has also had to learn
    to play along with the regulations local governments around the globe have seen
    fit to impose. The bear market of 2018 indicates the consequences of a lack of
    regulation. Large amounts of money are waiting for more regulation before they
    enter the crypto market. As it stands, traditional financial institutions have
    insufficient confidence in cryptocurrency and the crypto trading system. This
    limits the future possibilities for crypto economics. We want to enjoy freedom,
    but not create chaos. A balance must be struck. Exchanges that provide crypto
    trading platforms are rapidly globalizing. With more and more countries introducing
    clear, sensible regulation, I believe that crypto exchanges will survive and thrive,
    especially those that can bring themselves to play along with the government.
