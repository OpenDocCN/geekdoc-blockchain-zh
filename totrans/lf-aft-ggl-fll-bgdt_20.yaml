    of his business life as a cheerful disruptor of the telecom industry. He began
    at Bell Laboratories, where in 1995 he embarked on studies of how the voice-over-the-Internet
    protocol (VoIP) would affect the telecommunications companies. By allowing calls

    public switched telephone network (PSTN).

    Israel, which developed the first successful VoIP system in 1996\. It finally
    migrated to single chips at Vonage. Berninger followed the technology where it
    led. Now on Broadcom chips for a few dollars, high-definition voice over IP could
    be discreetly available on every Web page. “Hello Digital.”

    Berninger shook up the industry with the idea of long distance telephony as an
    Internet product. ITXC briefly spiked to an eight-billion-dollar market cap before
    the dotcom crash. Becoming a major supplier of VoIP, Berninger’s next venture,
    Vonage, reached a peak of 1.4 million customers in 2004\. It was eventually palsied
    by specious but exhausting Verizon patent claims that extracted close to $150

    behind this essential mythology.

    service is defined by law rather than by engineering. Many analysts, such as the
    estimable Tim Wu in The Master Switch and The Attention Merchants, therefore seem
    to believe that carriers face an irresistible temptation to manipulate the content
    they carry unless government can enforce “network neutrality” rules.[²](notes.html#ch20note-2)
    They see insidious forces at AT&T and Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner, reaching
    in and suppressing content they don’t like and favoring content that supports

    finds a conduit. Strangely enough, the key threat to actual network neutrality

- en: Charged with defending the emerging blockchain economy from such regulation
    in Washington, Perianne Boring of the Chamber of Digital Commerce feels like Alice
    at the Mad Hatter’s tea party.[⁴](notes.html#ch20note-4) To the riddle of cryptographic
    innovation, like the riddle of Internet neutrality, everyone has a different answer.
    The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission eyes virtual currency as a “commodity.”
    But money cannot be part of what it measures. The SEC, as we have seen, increasingly
    treats tokens as “securities.” The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes
    Enforcement Network believes that crypto-assets constitute money “transmissions,”
    and they seem to want them treated as potential crimes. The IRS treats virtual
    currency as “property” and proposes to assess capital gains and losses on every
    transaction, potentially burying the industry in accounting paperwork.

    the slightest idea,” answers the Mad Hatter, observing Washington’s rule: “If
    it moves tax it. If it keeps moving regulate it. If it stops moving subsidize
    it.” Since the Cambrian explosion of cryptographic innovation is not going to
    stop moving, it faces a growing threat of taxation and regulation, as every regulatory
    faction seeks jurisdiction over it.'

    it to flourish, with huge benefits to the U.S. economy and the world. A similar
    policy of tax and regulatory restraint is needed for this new outbreak of entrepreneurial
    creativity. It isn’t going to stop moving. Make it a public utility, and it will
    move overseas.

    than anyone. But the mythology suffusing the Google system of the world is now
    a serious threat to Google itself as a technology leader. In the evolving technological
    economy, shaped by cryptographic innovations, Google is going to have to compete
    again. Preening over its avoidance of evil, its free goods, and its clout in Washington
    will do no good. It is going to confront a new world where its center will not
    hold.

    It will need the creativity of the new blockchain movement. As Hölzle told the
    fiber optic engineers, Google will need hugely expanded bandwidth. And it will
    need to attract investment again. Google will have to become truly entrepreneurial
    to compete under a new system of the world.
