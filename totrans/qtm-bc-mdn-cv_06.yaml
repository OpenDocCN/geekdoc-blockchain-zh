    is encoded by operating on bits and performs operations using logical gates. Contrary
    to such traditional computing, the quantum computers exploit quantum theory and
    behavior of atomic and sub-atomic particles. In quantum this bit of data is represented
    by a single atom qubit. Qubits utilizes two states and the superposition of these
    two states and its quantum correlations. In Quantum mechanics the qubits work
    together to solve a particular problem. The quantum superposition and entanglement
    principle gives qubits the ability to perform with much faster computations than
    bits in classical computers. Quantum computers are disrupting every industry.
    They can solve problems that are intractable for current classical computers.
    This is the reason for increasing investment by Government and players like Google,
    Microsoft and IBM, in recent past. Advances in quantum computing, have implications
    in the future world and will change the way the world functions today. The present
    work outline various futuristic and practical examples in various fields such
    as online security, artificial intelligence, drug development, weather forecasting
    and climate change, where, the current capability of quantum on one hand, leave
    the several processes vulnerable, and on the other hand, its immense power of
    computation, gives opportunity to open doors to amazing developments in the field.
    In the present survey, the discussion is developed around the implications in
    these fields and a broad road map of futuristic events is sketched.

    protocol do not require any RTT measurement. The security of RAD communication
    protocol is examined in opposition of a type of Relay attack. The attacker first
    intercepts the photons associated with the tag, and then computes the photons
    randomly. Next, it sends the measured encoded results as Qbits to the reader.
    In relay attacks based on DB protocols, including RAD protocols the attacker relay
    all photons in the initialization phase. Therefore, the initialization phase protocol
    is same as original protocol in both attack or without any attack conditions.

    in the initialization phase between the reader and the tag. In case if request
    is invoked by the reader then the response by the attacker is provided as the
    Qbits accumulated in the quantum memory. The Qbits are accumulated from the tags
    and is identical to the result that is expected by the reader on measuring the
    Qbits. Therefore, attacker goes unidentified and exploits the communication system.
    The RAD protocol is not capable to identify relay attacks; reason behind this
    limitation is that the important component of a DB protocol is replaced by Qbit
    transmission in RAD protocol increasing chances of relay attacks [[33](#CR33)].
