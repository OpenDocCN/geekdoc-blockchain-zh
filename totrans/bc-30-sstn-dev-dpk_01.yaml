- en: Blockchain technology is a database of transactions. It is immutable, distributed,
    transparent and secure. Blockchain technology is an upcoming technology that has
    tremendous scope. This chapter discusses the components of a blockchain and its
    applications. The components of a blockchain include block, linked list, chain,
    genesis block and consensus protocol. A block is a single transaction. Blockchain
    is a collection of blocks linked by hash cryptography. Each user on the blockchain
    has a dedicated chain. The consensus protocol defines the mechanism using which
    transactions are added to the blockchain. The design of consensus protocol emphasizes
    on suitability to fight against network attacks and fast database update. Some
    consensus protocols included in this chapter are proof of work, proof of stake
    and proof of elapsed time. The several applications of blockchain as namely, internet
    of things, cloud computing, healthcare, medicine, storage and education. Smart
    city development and financial applications are other domains of use.

    introduction of Cryptocurrency. In 2008, the author named Satoshi Nakamoto published
    a paper entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” This chapter
    described a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash system where payments are made
    directly from one party to another without involving any bank or third party (regulator).
    These types of cash systems are known as cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency makes
    use of cryptography to secure transactions and hence the name. This cryptocurrency
    is based on blockchain technology.'

    The name comes from its structure, in which individual records, called blocks,
    are linked together in a single list, called a chain. The blockchain is a distributed
    ledger that ensures immutability, transparency and security.

- en: The most basic unit of a blockchain database is the block. It contains the transactions
    to store. [Figure 1.1](#b_9783110702507-001_fig_001) shows the structure of block.
    It consists of block number, nonce, data, previous hash and hash. The block number
    is a unique number assigned to each block generated by the user who creates the
    block. The nonce is a special value mined by the miner algorithms employed by
    the creator of the block. This value calculation is also known as puzzle solving.
    Previous hash is the encryption of the previous block. The hash is calculated
    using SHA-256 algorithm on the combination of the nonce, previous hash and data.

    are used. The use of this hash value is that the hash of the previous block is
    stored in the next block and used in the calculation of new hash. This ensures
    that if anyone tries to change an intermediary block in the blockchain, then all
    the hashes of all the blocks will have to be recalculated, which is impossible.
    This ensures that data once added cannot be changed in the blockchain. This property
    makes blockchain suitable for applications that are transactional in nature and
    where the previous data should never be modified. Nonce is utilized to ensure
    that the hash value generated for a block has a particular format like starting
    with 3 zeroes or 10 zeroes.

- en: After a block is added to the blockchain network, it is immutable. The size
    of the block limits the amount of data it can hold. The blockchain network decides
    the block size at the time of the creation of the network.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, when a new user is added to the blockchain network, a new chain is
    started for the user. This chain consists of a genesis or starting block. Then,
    the subsequent blocks containing user data are stored in a new block and appended
    to this genesis block, in the form of a linked list. This collection of the genesis
    block and all subsequent blocks is the blockchain. Collection of these blockchains
    is the complete database.

    that user are linked to it as shown in [Figure 1.2](#b_9783110702507-001_fig_002).
    The previous hash in the genesis block is zero as there is no previous block.
    Genesis block contains data about the user like name and the hash value assigned
    to that user. Then the nonce and a new hash are calculated. Then as the transactions
    happen, the new blocks will be appended to this starting block. However, adding
    a block to this blockchain is not a simple job. It needs to go to the P2P network
    through consensus protocol.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The SHA-256 algorithm used in the blockchain is a one-way and deterministic
    hash-calculating algorithm. One way means that the original text cannot be recalculated
    from the hash. It is unique for each string of characters and always 256 characters
    long no matter the data is 1 character or 100 characters. The algorithm has an
    avalanche effect that is a small change in the input data will completely change
    the output hash value. Therefore, if we hash “aaa” and “aaaa,” the two hash values
    generated will be completely different. This property makes the hacking of the
    hash difficult. The calculation of nonce and hash value is further discussed [[3](#b_9783110702507-001_ref_003)].

- en: As clear from blockchain architecture as shown in [Figure 1.3](#b_9783110702507-001_fig_003),
    the blockchain does not have a single copy. Every member of the network has a
    copy. If a new block is to be added, then it must be added to the whole network
    and all the peers need to be updated. This updating is ensured by the consensus
    protocol discussed next. Users, who agree to become the part of the blockchain
    network, and have a stake in it, can modify it by adding blocks. The identities
    of the peers are hidden from each other. Whenever a change is made in one peer
    database, the same change is propagated to the whole P2P network through voting.
    This distributed network is spread across the globe and connected by internet
    or some private network or cloud computing.

    Whether the network will accept or reject the block depends on the consensus protocol.
    The consensus protocol develops an agreement between all the peers and decides
    the condition for a block to be added to the network [[4](#b_9783110702507-001_ref_004),

    “how difficult it will be for a hacker to add a new block?” There are several
    types of attacks that are made on blockchain networks namely, double spending,
    eclipse attack and byzantine attack [[9](#b_9783110702507-001_ref_009)]. Stellar
