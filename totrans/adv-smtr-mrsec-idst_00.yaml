    of a slew of trend-setting digital technologies and tools, which come handy in
    quickly and easily producing and running scores of service-oriented, event-driven,
    people-centric, process-aware, cloud-native, business-critical and technology-agnostic
    digital applications. There are a number of revolutions and evolutions in the
    form of process excellence, integrated platforms, enabling patterns and products,
    best practices and optimized procedures in the digital space these days. All these
    path-breaking innovations and disruptions have laid down a stimulating foundation
    for the ensuing digital era. The result is that worldwide enterprises are keen
    on strategizing and embracing the proven and potential digital technologies in
    order to be ahead of their competitors in delivering premium offerings (product,
    solution and service), in envisaging fresh avenues to increase their revenues,
    in sharply enhancing customer experience, in significantly raising the productivity
    through efficient resource utilization, and in expanding the market and brand
    value.

    we can delectably expect digitally transformed enterprises, governments, cities,
    universities, retailing, healthcare, etc. The implications are definitely many
    and varied. Not only businesses get hugely benefited but also individuals are
    to receive a flurry of advantages in taking decisions, plunging into deals and
    deeds. That is, the aspects of digitization and digitalization are to strengthen
    not only business houses but also people in their everyday assignments and obligations.
    In other words, we are steadily journeying from business IT towards people IT.
    In this transformation, there are a few futuristic and fabulous technologies such
    as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Blockchain.
    There are other serious digital technologies such as microservices architecture
    (MSA), event-driven architecture (EDA), software-defined cloud infrastructures,
    big, fast and streaming data analytics methods, 5G connectivity, a stream of newer
    computing paradigms such as cloud-native, serverless and edge computing, digital
    twins, cybersecurity, etc.

    aim of articulating how this trinity of pioneering technologies fuses well to
    empower product and tool vendors, system integrators, service providers, researchers,
    solution organizations and others to envisage and implement a dazzling array of

    and involve a larger number of multifaceted digitized objects (physical, mechanical
    and electrical systems in our everyday environments get turned into digitized
    objects by incorporating scores of digitization and edge technologies such as
    sensors, actuators, chips, controllers, codes, stickers, beacons, LED lights,
    etc.), electronics systems, and software applications (hosted in local and remote
    IT environments) to produce an astounding amount of digital data. Through the
    connectivity (wired as well as wireless) methods, the IoT data gets gleaned and
    transmitted to appropriate analytics platforms running in hyperscale clouds or
    for proximate processing through edge clouds to emit out useful insights. In short,
    the IoT paradigm is to generate a lot of digital data.

    and strategic asset for any establishment and enterprise to march ahead in their
    aspirations and ambitions. Therefore, it is mandated to meticulously collect,
    cleanse and crunch data to extract actionable insights, which can be fed back
    to software systems, electronics devices, and digitized entities to exhibit intelligent
    behaviour. The process of translating data into information and into knowledge
    gets serious and sagacious attention from IT experts and exponents. Here comes
    the biggest role of AI processing. Transitioning data to useful knowledge is the
    prime role being played by AI algorithms, frameworks, platforms, accelerators,
    specialized engines, etc. For building and executing intelligent applications,
    AI is the way forward. Not only software applications but also all kinds of medical
    instruments, defence equipment, information appliances, handhelds, smartphones,
    kitchen utilities and wares, industrial machineries, robots, drones, consumer
    electronics, transport vehicles, etc. get the much-needed intelligence in time
    in order to be cognitive in their offerings, operations and outputs. With the
    surging popularity of AI methods, the dream of producing intelligent systems and
    environments (smarter homes, hotels, hospitals, etc.) is all set to become a grandiose
    reality.

    are liable to be attacked by evil doers and brilliant hackers remotely. The cyberattacks
    are consistently on the rise and their ingenuity is simply astounding. The security,
    safety and privacy of data, and properties are in danger with the advancement
    of cyber technologies and tools. Thus, it is indispensable that data, application,
    network, device and infrastructure security can’t be compromised at any cost.
    Thus came a slew of security-enablement mechanisms. Especially with the pervasive
    and persuasive nature of IoT devices, sensors, and workloads, the data and device
    security aspects garner a sincere attention in the recent past. The traditional
    security approaches and applications are found insufficient in such a deeply connected
    world. Interestingly blockchain is being touted as the best-in-class method for
    ensuring unbreakable and impenetrable security for software systems and digitized
    assets. This book has many well-written chapters to insightfully articulate and
    accentuate these three breakthrough technologies in detail for enlightening our
    esteemed readers.

    such as hands, legs, eyes, nose, etc. create, collect and pass on a variety of
    data from internal as well as external sources to our brain and all the refined
    data gets stored in our memory. These information-gathering elements are typically
    called as the IoT modules. The brain is the AI tool and the memory is the tamper-proof
    and integrity-guaranteed blockchain database to be the single source of truth.

    that provides openness and confidence for a new age of transactional applications.
    The fundamental fabric for Bitcoin is blockchain, which is a design pattern made
    up of three core elements: a distributed network, a public ledger, and digital
    transactions. Digital transactions are recorded in a public ledger by members
    of the distributed network. Members of the network run algorithms to test and
    validate the planned transaction before adding it to the network. The latest transaction
    is applied to the public ledger if a number of the network participants believe
    that the transaction is legitimate. In minutes or seconds, changes to the public
    ledger are mirrored in all copies of the blockchain. A transaction is immutable
    after it has been added and cannot be reversed or deleted. No one user of the
    network has the ability to tamper with or change data and everybody in the network
    has a full copy of the blockchain. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network
