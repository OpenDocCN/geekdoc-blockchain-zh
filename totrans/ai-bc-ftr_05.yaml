- en: In the space of a few years, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has
    become increasingly large and diversified. In addition, the use of new technologies
    is paramount and especially for businesses and institutions, also IoT considered as
    the engine of smart cities because it can be applied in different smart city services
    to facilitate the human daily lifestyle. However, this evolution brings cybersecurity
    challenges. Thus, security and privacy must be the main subject in this scenery.
    Also making the protection and sustainability of The Internet of Things issue
    essential by putting in place effective security, so that it can guarantee the
    availability of the services offered by a smart city ecosystem. In this chapter,
    we present a review of Blockchain technology and how it can help in shaping a
    safer IoT system, and we explore the major challenges and security issues stunting
    the growth of this concept.

    technologies, indeed they use a lot of things like smartphones, smartwatches,
    cars, and so many other devices. So how can people connect all these devices together?
    Here comes the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recently, this concept had received substantial attention in the research and
    academic community, especially after the industrial development in the manufacture
    of “things” that have the ability to identify themselves within the network, communicate
    over the Internet and interact with other things connected to the Internet, without
    human intervention. In fact, the Internet of Things (IoT) considered an emerging
    technology that plays an important role in our daily life. James (Jim) E. Heppelmann
    PTC CEO answering to the question of why should businesses investing in the IoT
    he said there is about 7 billion people on earth, one-third of them are connected
    to the internet with their smartphones, tablets, computers, and so on, but in
    2010 there were more things connected to the internet than people on earth and
    these things are not only smartphones and computers, they could be cars, thermostats,
    Fitbit, building, hospitals, etc. which means that the trend of connected things
    is accelerating and with the growth of the number of connected devices by 2020
    it predicting to have 50 billion connected devices [[1](#CR1)].

    Ashton. His point was to offer the facilities of humans to communicate with the
    virtual or fanciful condition [[2](#CR2)]. A thing or object in Internet of things
    (IoT) can be any computing device to whom we can appoint an IP address and that
    device has an ability to transfer the information over the network. Sensors are
    embedded in these devices so that these devices can detect the environment and
    gather the data, then transfer this collected data over the internet. Internet
    of Things allows being detected and controlled remotely. So we can say that IoT
    is a global network of things that have the ability to connect, collect, exchange
    data and Communicate through a Standard protocol. To be clear, it means the communication
    that allows the exchange of data between machines without human intervention.
    In other words, the Internet of Things (IoT) is used now in various topics, it
    is a system physical and virtual that contains a lot of sensors and other devices
    collecting, communicating, and exchanging information over the Internet.

    in order to make Smart Things. Like Smart Cities, Smart Schools, Smart Hospitals,
    and Smart Homes [[3](#CR3)]. So the issue here is the Authentication of each new
    device, which is trying to connect with other Smart Things. So IoT applications
    covered different fields in a smart city, and also wearable devices that humans
    wear such as glasses and watches, connected cars, smart agriculture, healthcare.
    This technological evolution, especially information and communications technology
    (ICT), has changed our society. As a result, the emergence of the concept of the
    “smart city” has come to be seen as a more efficient and sustainable way to fight
    against the challenges of the modern city and the vital needs. So it is necessary
    to have a complete overview of the available opportunities and to link them to
    the specific challenges of the city, hence the goal of the Smart City is to make
    better use of public resources by improving the quality of service to citizens
    while reducing costs; and operational aspects of the public administration.

- en: In order to improve a city's smart services, it is necessary to detect and collect
    data on its environments, infrastructure, events, and people. So, the intervention
    of IoT is not surprising as it is the key driver of smart cities. In fact, a smart
    city requires the integration of ICT and IoT in order to improve citizens’ quality
    of life. This means that a smart city will lead to the improvement of many fields
    such as healthcare, economy, business, agriculture, transportation, and education
    [[4](#CR4)]. These technologies depend on the interconnectivity of devices. Nevertheless,
    those connected devices might face several security challenges, if this interconnectivity
    is vulnerable people will lose trust in the system. So a security plan should
    be made at the planning phase if later it will cause cascading effects that could
    have a bad effect.

- en: Blockchain technology becomes important in the past 10 years, this concept emerged
    with the foundation of Bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency, in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto
    [[5](#CR5)]. So, Blockchain can help in reducing costs and barriers, removing
    a single point of failure and preventing censorship, and ensuring transparency
    and trust between all parties that are involved in an interaction. Blockchain
    technology comes as a solution for that by providing a shared ledger technology
    that allows any participant in the network to see the one system ledger. In other
    words, Blockchain consists of sharing a digital ledger that records transactions
    in a public or private peer-to-peer network. Distributed to all members’ nodes
    in the network, the ledger permanently records, in a sequential chain of cryptographic
    hash-linked blocks, so the blocks of data are organized and chained together.
    The integration of Blockchain technology in IoT can enforce security by using
    a trusted public ledger without the need for a third party. Because of that, a
    lot of companies invested in deploying Blockchain, and also much research has
    been carried out in the field of Blockchain in the past few years [[6](#CR6)].

- en: The history of connected objects began in 1999 when Kevin Ashton [[7](#CR7)],
    a pioneer of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, coined the term
    “Internet of Things”. In the same year, the concept was born in the United States,
    notably at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). This laboratory is dedicated
    to the creation of connected objects using radio frequency identification and
    wireless sensor networks. The Internet of Things (IoT) was born of mechanization
    and standardization, applied to the automation of document and information processing
    on hardware and then on digital media. It has spread rapidly with globalization.
    Little by little, objects were modified (with RFID chips for example) and becoming
    “connected objects” related to centralized servers capable of communicating with
    each other or with networks of servers and various actors, in a less and less
    centralized manner.

    created the DAL lamp. A mood lamp equipped with 9 LEDs, offering different colors
    and sold for 790 euros. Two years later, the creator's company launched the Nabaztag,
    a rabbit connected by Wi-Fi that reads e-mails aloud, emits visual signals, and
    broadcasts music. However, it was in 2007 that the IoT phenomenon took off, with
    the democratization of smartphones and the release of the first iPhone by Apple.
    Dematerialization is on the way. This revolution was finally the first step towards
    the exodus from the Internet. This technology was no longer accessible only from
    home or the office, but anywhere in the world and at any time. The world's population
    has gradually taken up the challenge, whether with the ease of use of laptops,
    or tablets that have been accessible to the general public since 2010\. The first
    smartphones or tablets date back much earlier (1989 for Samsung's GridPad tablet)
    but the lack of dematerialization of data and technological advances were not
    yet ready for the boom it is currently experiencing. Other connected objects appeared
    during the same period. For example, the Nabastag (or Karotz) rabbit, launched
    in 2005, was the first connected entertainment object. But the desire to connect
    everything to the internet and to connect all objects to each other has existed
    for many years. According to Gartner, in 2009 there were 2.5 billion connected
    objects and by 2020 there will be almost 30 billion objects connected to the internet.
    So we are experiencing exponential growth in the Internet of Things sector.

    In reality, the definition of the Internet of Things is not fixed. It cuts across
    conceptual and technical dimensions [[11](#CR11)]. Conceptually, the Internet
    of Things characterizes connected physical objects that have their own digital
    identity and are able to communicate with each other. This network creates a kind

    often have an interface that allows them to proactively check into the system.
    For example, our user will be able to see a video stream from inside his house
    on a mobile application or a web page. Depending on the scope of the connected
    object, the information flow is not always a one-way flow. Also, the user can
    be able to prompt action on the system. For example, the user can adjust the temperature
    of the cold room when he detects a heatwave thanks to the sensors, directly from
    his phone. Other actions are triggered automatically. For example, on some systems,
    the user can create scripts that will trigger by predefined rules. Thus, instead
    of alerting you directly, the system of the connected object will be able to alert
    the competent authorities directly.

    monitoring of the actual conditions of each building and the identification of
    areas most susceptible to the impact of external agents. The Urban IoT can provide
    a distributed database of structural integrity measurements, collected by appropriate
    sensors located in the buildings, such as vibration and deformation sensors to
    monitor building stresses, atmospheric sensors in the surrounding areas to monitor
    pollution levels, and moisture sensors for a complete characterization of environmental
    conditions. This database should reduce the need for costly periodic structural
    testing by human operators and allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
    actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and seismic measurements
    to better study and understand the impact of light earthquakes on the city's buildings.
    This database can be made accessible to the public in order to make citizens aware
    of the care taken to preserve the city's historical heritage. The practical implementation
    of this service, however, requires the installation of sensors in buildings and
    surrounding areas and their interconnection with a control system, which may require
    an initial investment to create the necessary infrastructure.

    private and are only accessible by authorized objects. The second category (public
    Blockchain) uses an unlimited number of anonymous objects. Based on cryptography,
    each actor can communicate in a secure way. Each object is represented by a key
    pair (public/private) and has the right to read, write and validate transactions
    in the Blockchain. The Blockchain is secure if 51% of the objects (or more) are
    honest and when the network consensus is reached. Usually Blockchains without
    permission consume a lot of power and time, as they require an amount of computation

    verified by other users, but the message can only be signed by the owner of the
    signature. Digital signatures can be created by a public-key, this public-key
    uses a key combination of public and private keys. The private key is saved only
    by the owner while the public key is distributed to other users. Other users can
    encrypt the message with the owner's public key, and the message can only be decrypted
    by the owner with his or her private key.

    Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to generate the digital signature [[19](#CR19)]. It
    involves three steps to create, sign and verify the message with the digital signature
    [[18](#CR18)]. The secret key (SK) and the public key (PK) are generated by the
    “generate Keys” method. The SK is kept only by the owner and the PK is distributed
    over nodes of the block chain. The message is signed using the SK. The signature
    method takes the SK and the message as input and generates the signature of the
    message. This signature can be verified with nodes using the verification method
    which takes PK, message and signature as input. If it is true, the message is
    verified, otherwise it is invalidated. Thus, the public key guarantees that the
    message was created by the owner of the signature and with the message verification,
    the identity of the user is verified. The public key is therefore used as the
    user identity in the blocking chain. By using the distributed blocking chain,
    users do not need to provide their social security number, phone number or email
    address to a central server or authority. They can create their digital identity
    themselves and distribute their public key over the distributed network. This

    their parents. The parent leaf nodes contain a hash of their leaf nodes. The nodes
    of the next generation, however, each have two child nodes and contain a hash
    of the hash their child nodes contain. If the tree is unbalanced because there
    is an uneven amount of leaves, the solitary leaf hash will be used twice. The
    advantage of this data structure is that the integrity of the entire tree can
    still be verified even if redundant leaves have been removed. An example of a

    general idea is to prove the validity of your ledger by performing calculations
    to obtain a result that fulfills certain requirements. In the case of Bitcoin,
    the calculation targets find a nonce which, when hashed, returns a hash value
    less than a global target value defined. Due to the unidirectional nature of hash
    algorithms, where it is impossible to compute a value that would result in an
    acceptable hash, finding's optimal method of calculating such values is simply
    to iterate through the numbers and hash them. This means that the only way to
    increase the chances that finding has the right properties is to increase the
    hash power of the computer. Since each node in the network that is being operated
    works on its own proof of work, they must agree on the choice of computer. Therefore,
    nodes that have found an acceptable hash, broadcast it and the other nodes in
    the network can easily verify that it is correct by performing the calculation
    themselves. If a longer valid chain of blocks is propagated to the nodes, the
    nodes always choose this one instead of their current chain. The longest block
    chain, which is also the one that requires the most computational work, will eventually
    be accepted as the main block chain by each node in the network.

    units a user has had Tcoin in his possession. To generate a new block, the user
    must perform a transaction called a “coinstake”. The sender and receiver of this
    transaction are the same, i.e. the user himself. Instead of working on a target
    value using computing power, the target is reached using the age of the coin.
    The higher the age of the part, the faster the block is likely to be generated.
    In addition, the chain of blocks with the highest number of years of life of the
    invested parts is considered valid. Thus, we end up with a system entirely regulated
    by stakes and the authors claim that this could replace proof of work.

    block. Each participant in the Bitcoin network can be a minor or not, and stores
    a copy of the current blockchain. In the mining operation, transactions are ordered
    and time-stamped, and then stored in blocks. Then a consensus mechanism is executed.
    Indeed, in order to validate the transactions, Bitcoin uses its own rules. Specifically,
    transactions have version numbers that tell Bitcoin objects the appropriate set
    of rules that must be used to validate them. To share the same blockchain and
    avoid conflicts between minors, Bitcoin uses the longest chain rule. A conflict
    occurs when multiple (competing) miners generate blocks at the same time, and
    each of those miners considers his or her block to be the legitimate block that

    IoT. They can shape the world by providing capabilities to measure, infer and
    understand environmental indices. The current development and improvement of technologies
    has provided effective and inexpensive devices for application to large-scale
    remote sensing uses. In addition, smartphones contain different types of sensors
    and therefore enable different types of mobile uses in different areas of the
    IoT. To this end, the main challenge is how to analyze the power consumption characteristics
    of a wireless sensor node. This systematic analysis of the energy of a sensor
    node is extremely important to identify problems in the energy system to enable
    effective optimization. The energy consumption of a sensor is as a result of the
    following operations: detection, processing and communication.'

    energy and leakage energy. The switching energy is determined by the supply voltage
    and the total capacity switched at the software level (when running software).
    The leakage energy, on the other hand, is the energy consumed when the computing
    unit does not perform any processing. In general, the processing energy is low
    compared to the energy required for communication.'

    characterized by its power; when the transmission power is high, the signal will

- en: As we know Blockchain technology has an important role in IoT security solutions,
    so Blockchain uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and SHA-256 hash function
    in order to provide data confidentiality and integrity. In fact, Blockchain is
    a solution that provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant
    in the network to see the one system of ledger and the block data contains a list
    of all transactions and a hash to the previous block. And each transaction in
    the public ledger is verified as a majority consensus of miner nodes and the blocks
    of data are immutable which means it could not be altered or erased. So a blockchain
    design contains a header block (Version, timestamp, block size, and the number
    of transactions, Merkle root, the nonce, the difficulty target), and the block
    body contains the list of transactions [[31](#CR31)]. Moreover Bitcoin considered
    as an application that runs on the top of blockchain infrastructure. Also, Ethereum
    blockchain implements smart contracts which means it store, record and run smart
    contract, and recently other smart contract blockchain platforms have been emerged
    (Hyperledger, Eris, Stellar, Ripple, and Tendermint). In addition, there are various
    applications of smart contract blockchain like trading to autonomous machine-to-machine
    transactions, asset tracking to automated access control and sharing, digital
    identity and voting to certification, management, and governance of records and
    data.

    systems, and cargo shipping companies. Here are some useful features of blockchain
    that can be beneficial for IoT security devices: First, Address space: 160 bit
    (20 bytes) address space so 160 bit hash of public key, this public key generated
    by using ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). Second, Identity
    of Things (IDoT) and Governance: IoT device owner could be changed in addition
    to other attributes of the device such as type, serial number, deployment GPS
    coordinates, and location and so on, also the device could have a relationship
    with human or other devices or services. So blockchain comes up with a solution
    to those challenges of identity and access management by providing trustworthy
    and authorized identity registration, ownership tracking and monitoring of products,
    goods, and assets. The approaches like TrustChain in order to have secure transactions
    and giving identity to the connected IoT device with the management and governance
    of the device life cycle. In addition, Data authentication and integrity: all
    the data transmitted in the blockchain network are e cryptographically proofed
    and signed by the true sender that has a unique public key and GUID. Also, Authentication,
    Authorization, and Privacy: with smart contacts single and multiparty authentication
    to an IoT Device is provided along with authorization access rules and data privacy,
    Finally, Secure Communications: the protocols used in communication and routing
    between IoT devices are not secure enough (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, RPL, 6LoWPAN) that’s
    why we used them with other security protocols like DTLS and TLS. But with blockchain,
    there is no need for those protocols since every IoT device has its own unique
    GUID and asymmetric key pair [[31](#CR31)].'

    and security requirements, they also mention the use of Blockchain to solve security
    problems. So they categorized security levels into 3 main levels: Low-level security
    issues, Intermediate-level security issues and High-level security issues. The
    first level is concerned physical and data link layers of communication and hardware
    level (Jamming adversaries, insecure initialization, Low-level Sybil and spoofing
    attacks, insecure physical interface and Sleep deprivation attack). The second
    level is related to communication, routing and session management at transport
    layers of IoT (Replay or duplication attacks due to fragmentation, Insecure neighbor
    discovery, Buffer reservation attack, RPL routing attack, Sinkhole and wormhole
    attacks, Sybil attacks on intermediate layers, Authentication and secure communication,
    Transport level end-to-end security, Session establishment and resumption and
    Privacy violation on cloud-based IoT). The third level which is the high-level
    security issues is related to applications that are executed on IoT (CoAP security
    with the internet, insecure interfaces, insecure software/firmware, and Middleware
    security).'

    problems and integrate Blockchain technology to enhance authentication for MQTT
    protocol. Their solution adopts the use of Blockchain as another channel with
    the use of Ethereum to enforce security without using TLS by using hashes as user
    pseudonyms in smart contracts. Also using Blockchain here is about to have a trusted
    public ledger without the need of a third party, the client sends a CONNECT message
    to the broker and the authentication process offers two fields to transmit username
    and password to the broker but the fields are not encrypted which make it exposed
    to attacks. To solve this problem they use One Time Password (OTP) which means
    a password valid for only a session but it cannot be sent in the same channel
    that’s why they use Blockchain as another channel to implement two-factor authentication.

    interact with others, and we are talking about thousands of devices. The use of
    the basic model of a server-client may have some limitations, and it’s not safe
    because this model is based on a centralized system where the server and a local
    database contain all the code, so anyone has access to it can manipulate or change
    the code.

    Blockchain technology to monitor and control IoT devices. They used RSA algorithm
    to manage keys, Ethereum platform is used here to store public keys while private
    keys are protected in the IoT devices. Ethereum is one of the biggest cryptocurrency
    that supports smart contracts, so the smart contract contains all the code of
    the Turing-complete that runs on Ethereum so we can control IoT devices.

- en: Agrawal et al. [[36](#CR36)] in their survey they present a solution for providing
    continuous security in IoT based on the distributed nature of Blockchain through
    IoT-Zone identification. So each user in an IoT system is stored as a node on
    a Blockchain network, and each interaction of this node considered as a transaction.
    In order to make this transaction legitimate, it requires a unique crypto-token
    to avoid unauthorized access which makes the system more secure and safe. Three
    main phases are needed in this process, IoT-Zone identification by the activation
    of user IoT trails, IoT-token generation where the permission is checked with
    the Enrollment Certificate Authority (ECA), then the IoT-token is validated.

    devices such as resource limitations, Heterogeneous devices, Interoperability
    of security protocols, single points of failure, Hardware/firmware vulnerabilities,
    Trusted updates and management, and also some blockchain vulnerabilities because
    the mechanism that depends on miner’s hashing can be compromised which allows
    attackers to host the blockchain. Research on the application of blockchain technology
    in IoT and smart environments is quite extensive, and there are many challenges
    awaited them. This chapter shortly introduces how blockchain technology can be
    used to solve security problems in IoT systems. We hope that this discussion and
    exploration can pave a new path for the development and implementation of IoT.
