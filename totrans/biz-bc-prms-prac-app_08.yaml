    maybe you have a head start. If you didn't, perhaps you can shift a gear, and
    become proactive. Whether you are leading or following, eventually you will have
    to sharpen your blockchain strategy.

- en: Implementing the blockchain is still a new competency. The uncertainties, however,
    cannot be used as an excuse to hold up what must be done. All of us engaged are
    pioneers on a journey, and we have a responsibility to keep sharing what we are
    learning, so we can keep lighting the way for those that are behind us. It may
    take us longer to arrive at our destinations, but it will certainly help the followers,
    and they will pay us back by making the market bigger and easier to navigate.
    The future success of blockchains will depend critically on hundreds of millions
    of people using them.

    of social and political change. If we miss their higher calling, we would be falling
    short of realizing their fullest potential.

- en: One valuable blockchain outcome we exposed is the emergent crypto economy, the
    sum of the economic realizations resulting from applying the blockchain's potential.
    This crypto economy is a trust economy that is decentralized at birth, both politically
    and architecturally; and it lends equal access and lower barriers of entry to
    all. As we prepare to get on board the crypto economy, undoubtedly it looks fuzzy,
    foggy, buggy, risky, uncertain, and unproven. Then suddenly, it will blossom and
    grow with more benefits than disadvantages.

    certainly not exhausted everything to be explored. There is plenty more that will
    unfold, much of it from your own discoveries. I am sure that the best cases and
    ideas are not yet in the blockchain wild. Still, there remains many unanswered
    questions. What will be the impact of blockchains on the world economy? Who will
    be the Amazons, Googles, and Facebooks of the blockchain? What will be the tipping
    point? Will regulators stay patient, or will they prematurely declare their intentions?
    If the consensus ledger is the hammer, can we also find the nail?

- en: The blockchain's message is simple, but strong. Let innovation lead. The blockchain
    is not about a better Web, a better bank, or a better service. The survival of
    the blockchain will depend on what you will do with it, and it is not only about
    its technical features. Its adoption will be gradual, starting with developers
    and startup entrepreneurs, then techno-business people, followed by organizations
    that see change, and society demanding change, and ending with organizations that
    once resisted change.

    and enterprises are sometimes skeptical. As a result of blockchain-enabled business
    models, some existing intermediaries will be at risk. We know it. And some new
    ones will emerge, perhaps more as virtual, transparent, and distributed entities
    that can be trusted programmatically.

    If you enjoyed it, I invite you to explore further how to rethink trust, wealth,
    and information in my next book, Centerless. The new era of decentralization will
    soon be upon us.

    new levels of freedom, and let us program our world on top of them, any way we
    would like.
