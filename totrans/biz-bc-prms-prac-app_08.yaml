  zh: 后记
- en: BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WAS NOT CALLED FOR. It just happened. If you reacted initially,
    maybe you have a head start. If you didn't, perhaps you can shift a gear, and
    become proactive. Whether you are leading or following, eventually you will have
    to sharpen your blockchain strategy.

  zh: 区块链技术**并非**被需求而来的。它只是发生了。如果你最初做出了反应，也许你有一个领先优势。如果你没有，也许你可以换一个挡位，变得主动。无论你是领导者还是跟随者，最终你将不得不磨练你的区块链战略。
- en: Implementing the blockchain is still a new competency. The uncertainties, however,
    cannot be used as an excuse to hold up what must be done. All of us engaged are
    pioneers on a journey, and we have a responsibility to keep sharing what we are
    learning, so we can keep lighting the way for those that are behind us. It may
    take us longer to arrive at our destinations, but it will certainly help the followers,
    and they will pay us back by making the market bigger and easier to navigate.
    The future success of blockchains will depend critically on hundreds of millions
    of people using them.

  zh: 实施区块链仍然是一项新的能力。然而，不确定性不能作为阻碍必须完成的事情的借口。我们所有人都是这项旅程的先锋，我们有责任不断分享我们所学到的知识，这样我们就能不断为身后的那些人照亮道路。我们到达目的地的过程可能会更长，但这肯定会帮助跟随者，他们将通过扩大市场和简化导航来回报我们。区块链未来的成功将严重依赖于数亿人的使用。
- en: Blockchains are more than business-technology enablers. They are instruments
    of social and political change. If we miss their higher calling, we would be falling
    short of realizing their fullest potential.

- en: One valuable blockchain outcome we exposed is the emergent crypto economy, the
    sum of the economic realizations resulting from applying the blockchain's potential.
    This crypto economy is a trust economy that is decentralized at birth, both politically
    and architecturally; and it lends equal access and lower barriers of entry to
    all. As we prepare to get on board the crypto economy, undoubtedly it looks fuzzy,
    foggy, buggy, risky, uncertain, and unproven. Then suddenly, it will blossom and
    grow with more benefits than disadvantages.

  zh: 我们揭示的一个有价值的区块链成果是新兴的加密经济，它是应用区块链潜力所产生经济实现的总和。这个加密经济是一个从诞生时起就政治和架构上去中心化的信任经济；它为所有人提供了平等的访问和较低的进入门槛。当我们准备加入加密经济时，无疑它看起来是模糊的、笼统的、有缺陷的、有风险的、不确定的，还未被证实的。然而，突然之间，它会绽放并成长，优点多于缺点。
- en: Although we have explored the blockchain topic at length in this book, we have
    certainly not exhausted everything to be explored. There is plenty more that will
    unfold, much of it from your own discoveries. I am sure that the best cases and
    ideas are not yet in the blockchain wild. Still, there remains many unanswered
    questions. What will be the impact of blockchains on the world economy? Who will
    be the Amazons, Googles, and Facebooks of the blockchain? What will be the tipping
    point? Will regulators stay patient, or will they prematurely declare their intentions?
    If the consensus ledger is the hammer, can we also find the nail?

  zh: 尽管我们在本书中详细探讨了区块链主题，但我们肯定没有探讨完所有需要探讨的内容。还有很多将会展开，其中大部分将来自你自己的发现。我相信最好的案例和想法还没有出现在区块链的荒野中。然而，仍然有很多未回答的问题。区块链对世界经济的影响将是什么？谁将成为区块链的亚马逊、谷歌和脸书？什么是转折点？监管者会保持耐心，还是会过早地表达他们的意图？如果共识账本是大锤，我们也能找到钉子吗？
- en: The blockchain's message is simple, but strong. Let innovation lead. The blockchain
    is not about a better Web, a better bank, or a better service. The survival of
    the blockchain will depend on what you will do with it, and it is not only about
    its technical features. Its adoption will be gradual, starting with developers
    and startup entrepreneurs, then techno-business people, followed by organizations
    that see change, and society demanding change, and ending with organizations that
    once resisted change.

  zh: 区块链的信息简单而强烈。让创新引领。区块链不仅仅是更好的网络、更好的银行或更好的服务。区块链的生存将取决于你将如何使用它，而且这不仅仅是关于它的技术特性。它的采用将是逐渐的，从开发者、初创企业家开始，然后是技术商业人士，接着是看到变化的组织，然后是社会要求变化，最后是曾经抵制变化的组织。
- en: Amidst this activity lies a dichotomy of hope. Startups are inherently optimistic,
    and enterprises are sometimes skeptical. As a result of blockchain-enabled business
    models, some existing intermediaries will be at risk. We know it. And some new
    ones will emerge, perhaps more as virtual, transparent, and distributed entities
    that can be trusted programmatically.

  zh: 在这股活动中存在着希望的对立。初创企业本质上是乐观的，而企业有时则持怀疑态度。由于区块链启用的商业模式，一些现有的中介将面临风险。我们知道这一点。而一些新的中介将会出现，或许更多的是作为虚拟的、透明的、分布式的实体，可以被程序化地信任。

    soon be upon us.
