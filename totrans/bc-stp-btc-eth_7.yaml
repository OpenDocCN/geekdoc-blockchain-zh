- en: 'ConclusionIn this book’s introduction, I pointed at the tired practices in
    global finance that are now ready for a transformation, or even revolution, by
    entrepreneurs who harness Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains. I claimed
    that innovation is predatory, and I invited you on an adventure. I promised this
    book would serve as your map to navigate the confusion on this frontier. Here
    at the end of the book, I hope you have found insight into the industry and inspiration
    to start your project.Any financial function that makes one depend on a third
    party is a candidate for automation on a decentralized blockchain. A third party’s
    presence creates a need for an immutable ledger of transactions. Most chapters
    include ideas for starting a company based on cryptocurrency and tokenized assets.
    You now know the attack angles on the legacy system by applying Bitcoin and blockchains
    to create better financial products. The better the entrepreneur understands the
    past and present of money and trade, the better they will envision and build its
    future.The territory of freedom is a developing ecosystem, where the first types
    of companies to survive and thrive are speculators, traders, and market makers.
    In Chapter 3, I emphasized liquidity and the catalysts of network effects. This
    established layer of speculation and trade serves as a base as the next layer
    matures, including payment systems, smart contracts, and wallets.Then we explored
    these younger types of companies, who thrive in virtual jurisdictions on popular
    blockchains. Lightning Network makes the ‘good old Bitcoins’ more spendable, and
    DeFi is an experimental lab that competes with traditional finance. If ETH2.0
    lives up to its promises, we can expect efficient decentralized applications at
    scale, available for mainstream users. Did any of these chapters give you an idea
    for a project? I look forward to hearing about your plans.In the coming years,
    we might get a sense of what a Bitcoin-based financial system looks like. Near
    the end of 2020, the global economy is depressed because of the Covid-19 pandemic,
    and a growing part of the population sees through the magic trick of fiat money.
    The political and business elites discuss “The Great Reset” of the economy and
    financial system at the World Economic Forum. Meanwhile, a growing number of prominent
    investors and executives have become Bitcoin enthusiasts and affirm its value
    in public. These milestones come together as an excellent foundation for another
    bull market. When the prices of Bitcoin and other crypto-assets take off, the
    time is right for seeking investors and customers for your crypto-venture.As long
    as the Bitcoin network does not yet handle a large number of smaller transactions,
    BTC stays a commodity akin to gold: individuals and institutions can use it to
    store and transfer large sums of money. If—when—Bitcoin does scale, with sidechains
    and Lightning Network, it will completely revive “hard” commodity money, with
    the added benefit of frictionless and private transactions. Developers and entrepreneurs
    will continue to invent new financial assets and operations, building toward the
    future of money that is secure, convenient, and free of central control.I hope
    you will join me in being a part of the future.In this book’s introduction, I

  zh: 结论在这本书的引言中，我指出了全球金融中那些现在准备通过利用比特币、以太坊和其他区块链的创业者进行转型甚至革命的疲惫做法。我声称创新是掠夺性的，我邀请您踏上这次冒险。我承诺这本书将作为您在这个前沿导航的地图。在这本书的结尾，我希望您已经对行业有了深刻的理解，并获得了开始您项目的灵感。任何需要依赖第三方的金融功能都是去中心化区块链自动化的候选者。第三方的存在创造了需要不可变交易账本的需求。大多数章节都包括基于加密货币和代币化资产创立公司的想法。现在您已经知道通过应用比特币和区块链来攻击传统系统，以创造更好的金融产品。创业者对货币和贸易的过去和现在的理解越深刻，他们就越能想象和构建其未来。自由的领域是一个正在发展的生态系统，其中第一批生存和繁荣的公司是投机者、交易者和市场制造者。在第3章中，我强调了流动性和网络效应的催化剂。这一层投机和交易的基础，随着下一层成熟，包括支付系统、智能合约和钱包。然后我们探索了这些在流行区块链上的虚拟司法管辖区中茁壮成长的新兴公司。闪电网络使“古老的比特币”更加易于消费，而DeFi是一个与传统金融竞争的实验性实验室。如果ETH2.0兑现其承诺，我们可以期待为主流用户大规模提供高效的去中心化应用程序。这些章节中是否有任何一章给您一个项目的想法？我期待听到您的计划。在未来的几年里，我们可能会对基于比特币的金融系统有一个大致的了解。2020年底，全球经济因COVID-19大流行而陷入低迷，越来越多的人看穿了法定货币的把戏。在世界经济论坛上，政治和商业精英们讨论了经济的“大重置”。同时，越来越多的知名投资者和执行官公开成为比特币爱好者，并确认其价值。这些里程碑共同为另一个牛市奠定了坚实的基础。当比特币和其他加密资产的价格飙升时，为您的加密冒险寻求投资者和客户的时间就到了。只要比特币网络还不能处理大量小额交易，BTC就类似于黄金这样的商品：个人和机构可以用它来存储和转移大额资金。如果——当——比特币实现了扩展，通过侧链和闪电网络，它将完全恢复“硬”商品货币，并增加了无摩擦和私密的交易的好处。开发者和企业家将继续发明新的金融资产和操作，构建一个安全、方便且不受中央控制的货币未来。我希望您能加入我，成为未来的一部分。在这本书的引言中，我指出了全球金融中那些现在准备通过利用比特币、以太坊和其他区块链的创业者进行转型甚至革命的疲惫做法。我声称创新是掠夺性的，我邀请您踏上这次冒险。我承诺这本书将作为您在这个前沿导航的地图。在这本书的结尾，我希望您已经对行业有了深刻的理解，并获得了开始您项目的灵感。任何需要依赖第三方的金融功能都是去中心化区块链自动化的候选者。第三方的存在创造了需要不可变交易账本的需求。大多数章节都包括基于加密货币和代币化资产创立公司的想法。现在您已经知道通过应用比特币和区块链来攻击传统系统，以创造更好的金融产品。创业者对货币和贸易的过去和现在的理解越深刻，他们就越能想象和构建其未来。自由的领域是一个正在发展的生态系统，其中第一批生存和繁荣的公司是投机者、交易者和市场制造者。在第3章中，我强调了流动性和网络效应的催化剂。这一层投机和交易的基础，随着下一层成熟，包括支付系统、智能合约和钱包。然后我们探索了这些在流行区块链上的虚拟司法管辖区中茁壮成长的新兴公司。闪电网络使“古老的比特币”更加易于消费，而DeFi是一个与传统金融竞争的实验性实验室。如果ETH2.0兑现其承诺，我们可以期待为
