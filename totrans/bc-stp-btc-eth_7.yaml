- en: 'ConclusionIn this book’s introduction, I pointed at the tired practices in
    global finance that are now ready for a transformation, or even revolution, by
    entrepreneurs who harness Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains. I claimed
    that innovation is predatory, and I invited you on an adventure. I promised this
    book would serve as your map to navigate the confusion on this frontier. Here
    at the end of the book, I hope you have found insight into the industry and inspiration
    to start your project.Any financial function that makes one depend on a third
    party is a candidate for automation on a decentralized blockchain. A third party’s
    presence creates a need for an immutable ledger of transactions. Most chapters
    include ideas for starting a company based on cryptocurrency and tokenized assets.
    You now know the attack angles on the legacy system by applying Bitcoin and blockchains
    to create better financial products. The better the entrepreneur understands the
    past and present of money and trade, the better they will envision and build its
    future.The territory of freedom is a developing ecosystem, where the first types
    of companies to survive and thrive are speculators, traders, and market makers.
    In Chapter 3, I emphasized liquidity and the catalysts of network effects. This
    established layer of speculation and trade serves as a base as the next layer
    matures, including payment systems, smart contracts, and wallets.Then we explored
    these younger types of companies, who thrive in virtual jurisdictions on popular
    blockchains. Lightning Network makes the ‘good old Bitcoins’ more spendable, and
    DeFi is an experimental lab that competes with traditional finance. If ETH2.0
    lives up to its promises, we can expect efficient decentralized applications at
    scale, available for mainstream users. Did any of these chapters give you an idea
    for a project? I look forward to hearing about your plans.In the coming years,
    we might get a sense of what a Bitcoin-based financial system looks like. Near
    the end of 2020, the global economy is depressed because of the Covid-19 pandemic,
    and a growing part of the population sees through the magic trick of fiat money.
    The political and business elites discuss “The Great Reset” of the economy and
    financial system at the World Economic Forum. Meanwhile, a growing number of prominent
    investors and executives have become Bitcoin enthusiasts and affirm its value
    in public. These milestones come together as an excellent foundation for another
    bull market. When the prices of Bitcoin and other crypto-assets take off, the
    time is right for seeking investors and customers for your crypto-venture.As long
    as the Bitcoin network does not yet handle a large number of smaller transactions,
    BTC stays a commodity akin to gold: individuals and institutions can use it to
    store and transfer large sums of money. If—when—Bitcoin does scale, with sidechains
    and Lightning Network, it will completely revive “hard” commodity money, with
    the added benefit of frictionless and private transactions. Developers and entrepreneurs
    will continue to invent new financial assets and operations, building toward the
    future of money that is secure, convenient, and free of central control.I hope
    you will join me in being a part of the future.In this book’s introduction, I
