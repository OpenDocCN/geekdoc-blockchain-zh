- en: The internet of things (IoT) is paving a path for connecting a plethora of smart
    devices together that emerges from the novel 5G-based applications. This evident
    heterogeneity invites the integration of diverse technologies such as wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs), software-defined networks (SDNs), cognitive radio networks
    (CRNs), delay tolerant networks (DTNs), and opportunistic networks (oppnets).
    However, the security and privacy are prominent conundrums due to featured compatibility
    and interoperability aspects of evolving directives. Blockchain is the most nascent
    paradigm instituted to resolve the issues of security and privacy while retaining
    performance standards. In this chapter, advances of blockchain technology in aforesaid
    networks are investigated and presented as means to be followed as security practices
    for pragmatically realizing the concepts.

    govern the emerging communication based services and their applications. These
    directives were formed to address lacking aspects of different existing technologies
    with an improved perspective for elevating performance standards. Though, each
    distinct directive has limitations in security, where application of cumbersome
    but tamper-proof security mechanisms would obviously degrade the performance of
    them. Thus, there is a clear trade-off between latency and applicable security
    level. In addition, similar to most existing communication technologies or protocols,
    verifiable security is only credible with Trusted Third Parties (TTPs), or certificate
    authorities. Blockchain, in contrast, offers a decentralized approach that eliminates
    the TTP dependency. Moreover, the transparent yet tamper-proof mechanism in blockchain
    is enabling it to be adopted for diverse applications to secure their transactions.
    Thus, this chapter is focusing on the technologies of WSN, oppnets, SDN, CRN,
    and DTNs for adopting blockchain to their security limitations. The chapter is
    mainly categorized into the sections of WSN, SDN, CRN, DTN and oppnets, where
    various prevailing blockchain adaptations are discussed summarizing the best security
    practices.

- en: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are basically ad hoc networks, amalgamating
    small devices embedded with sensing capabilities deployed to monitor physical
    activities in the surrounding area of interest. These sensor nodes should have
    the characteristics of large coverage area, monitoring with high precision, self-organization,
    random deployment and fault-tolerance, etc. Due to the possibility of providing
    low cost solutions, nowadays Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are getting more
    and more attention in many real-world applications. However, the dense deployment
    of many sensor nodes cause unique security challenges in its management. In the
    meantime, adaptation of many security protocols to overcome those challenges are
    not straightforward because of inherent limits for energy consumption at sensor
    nodes as well as availability of lower memory and storage space. Therefore, it
    is timely important researchers to discuss the trade-off between resource consumption
    minimization and security maximization in WSNs.

    its standards beyond the conventional networking infrastructures (Kreutz, Ramos,
    & Verissimo, 2013). This concept offers advanced network management capabilities
    to the network administrator by enabling configuration of networking instances
    independent of the hardware layer. Infact, diversification exhibited in networking
    devices and their plethoric aggregate are contriving compatibility and interoperability
    debacles. In SDN, homogeneity of the both core and access networks are improved
    with standardizing the hardware specifications; and higher reliance on hardware
    based processing is transformed into an autonomous processing approach with software
    integration (Kumar et al., 2017). In fact, SDN envisages solutions for complex
    issues in traditional networking topologies and routing algorithms by integrating
    intelligence to the control plane. In addition, this is a paradigm shift for network
    operators that eases their issues with hardware layer and the ability to advance
    networking features with novel requirements to broadened avenues. Apart from flexibility,
    main benefits of SDN can be specified as: cost effectiveness (monetary), centralization,
    higher throughput, dynamic nature that support higher mobility, low communication
    latency, optimum network utilization, rapid and efficient load-balancing, fault
    tolerance, and adaptable/ context-aware security (Tomovic, Pejanovic-Djurisic,
    & Radusinovic, 2014; Jaballah, Conti, & Lal, 2019; Scott-Hayward, O''Callaghan,

    on the Fifth Generation (5G) cellular systems. Meanwhile, the 5G and beyond wireless
    network designers face challenging demands such as more capacity, higher data
    rates, lower latency, better connectivity for a massive number of users, lesser
    cost and energy, and more importantly improved quality of experience (QoE) (Munsub
    Ali, Liu, & Ejaz, 2020). Moreover, with the increase in the number of communication
    devices, the requirement for higher bandwidth is essential. However, with the
    limited and expensive radio spectrum resources, allocation of new frequency bands
    is an extremely difficult task. Therefore, efficient management of the spectrum
    under dynamic policies has recently become a prospective research topic.

    still there are many rural areas that do not have any network connectivity or
    sometimes intermittent. These scenarios demand the development of distributed
    networking techniques in an opportunistic manner to provide atleast some level
    of service with ad-hoc networks. Consequently, these Opportunistic Networks (oppnets)
    integrate diverse communication, computation, sensing, storage and other devices
    and resources in the surrounding. The initial set of nodes associated with an
    oppnet are called seed nodes. Once other nodes are invited to become potential
    helpers for the original oppnet, this seed oppnet nurtures into an expanded oppnet
    while persisting various security concerns.

    trusted and robust communication prospects. But the challenge is to identify the
    most suitable location in placing blockchain for current IoT settings. With the
    amalgamation as third party to keep data in centralized data centers and later
    a fog layer to offload the traffic burden from the data centers, the current IoT
    is a three tier architecture namely IoT devices layer, Fog layer and the cloud
    layer. Generally, the incoming requests for access level can be divided as real-time,
    non-realtime and delay tolerant. Delay tolerant networks are helpful in addressing
    issues related to lack of infrastructure, stationary nodes and connectivity in
    today’s heterogeneous networks by storing and forwarding facilities. Nevertheless,
    these networks require new authentication and trust establishing mechanisms to
    ensure that no adversary parties can destroy the privacy in time dependent delay
    tolerant network routes.

    In host-based attacks, adversary parties always compromise with the users in the
    network to reveal information such as passwords or keys about the sensor nodes.
    This is achieved by breaking the software running on the sensor nodes or tampering
    the hardware to extract the program code, data and keys stored at sensor nodes.
    Whilst network-based attacks include all the attacks related to information transmission
    and/or deviations crafted on the intended functioning of protocols. The summary
    of inherent four-fold attacks such as interruption, interception, modification
    and fabrication with respect to different layers in ISO-OSI layer are shown in
    Table 1 (Chowdhury & Kader, 2013).

- en: Hence, the security requirements of WSNs can be identified under four disciplines
    namely Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication and Availability (CIAA). For
    any network, the data authenticity is required to guarantee the identities of
    communicating nodes whether the data has been originated from a reliable source.
    In the presence of malicious nodes in the network, the data at transit nodes can
    be tampered, altered or changed by adversaries. In order to ensure the data integrity,
    normally a code of message integrity is used. Since radio access technologies
    are open resources, sometimes passive attackers can eavesdrop messages or discover
    secrets in surveillance applications by collecting secret data through other compromised
    nodes. Consequently, encryption standards should be defined in advance to keep
    the confidentiality among nodes. Ultimately, the availability shall determine
    whether a node has the ability to use the resources and the network to transmit
    data (Zia & Zomaya, 2006).

- en: As Figure 1 indicates, conventional networks are mainly partitioned into access
    or local, edge, and core networks; where the nodes or devices operating at each
    level are different in terms of their build, system specifications (processing,
    storage, memory, energy requirement, access interfaces and amounts), financial
    cost, operating cost, embedded protocols, and operational complexity. In fact,
    the complexity of the devices are dependent on the layer in which the device is
    operating in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) or TCP/IP protocol stacks.
    Typically, local network devices are operating at Layer 2 (Data-Link) while edge
    and core network devices are extending to the rest of the layers above Layer 2
    (Network to Application in OSI). Directives such as Multi-Protocol Labeled Switching
    (MPLS), and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) have been introduced to improve
    the packet forwarding efficiency and security at edge and core networks (Liyanage,
    Ylianttila, & Gurtov, 2016). Upgrading the holistic network into such directives
    require the replacement of networking nodes, so that they are compatible with
    the pursuing updates. This is an obvious drawback with the existing networks that
    restricts the application of advancements to real-world networks. In addition,
    control/signalling information, and data forwarded through the network are carried
    through separate channels; which make bandwidth utilization arduous due to the
    dedicated signalling channels. Traffic load balancing has become a static and
    standalone process that can be monitored and administered only via the control
    channels remotely. Since the load balancing algorithms/ mechanisms/ protocols
    should be executed at the device level, managing the control signals and statistics
    has become overly de-centralized beyond the acceptable controlling domains. This
    is an important aspect of novel services that require more control over the traffic
    management with the prescribed Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience
    (QoE) classifications.

    in Figure 2\. Application layer launches the applications and services specified
    in the networking context. The application instances are generating the flow rules
    and convey the requirements to the controller via the Northbound Application Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) or plugins (Feghali, Kilany, & Chamoun, 2015). The infrastructure
    layer consists of network elements that have a controller logic embedded to it.
    As specified above, these network elements can be configured into different network
    functions. The control layer is the most important aspect of this architecture
    that centralizes the complete network. The controller is responsible for the functions
    of network visualization, service provisioning, network management, and trac engineering.
    These functions are carried out by the Network Operating System (NOS) and an instance
    of each network service is deployed at the controller. High-level policies can
    be formed at the controller supporting security and dependability (Kreutz et al.,
    2013). OpenFlow (OF) protocol is employed to establish the communication channel
    between the controller and the network elements while NOX, POX, Faucet, Floodlight,
    ONOS, Open vSwitch, Cherry and Beacon are most commonly used controllers. The
    controller is reaching the network elements via the resource abstraction layer
    from southbound APIs. In addition to the three common layers, there is a management
    and administration layer that interacts with all other layers. In fact, management
    abstraction layer is interacting with: application layer on Service Level Agreements
    (SLAs) for each service instance, control layer for updating configuration policy
    and monitoring performance, and infrastructure layer for setting up and launching
    network elements.'

- en: The same benefits of SDN, network programmability and centralized control logic,
    are exposing the IT networks towards nascent threats (Kreutz et al., 2013). The
    allowance granted for application layer entities to engage with control plane
    elements (i.e. for improving the flexibility) is exposing the rest of the architecture
    towards unauthorized access control, and malicious network rule insertion threats
    (Tselios, Politis, & Kotsopoulos, 2017). Centralized nature of the paradigm is
    compromising the holistic network in case the SDN controller becomes infiltrated.
    The softwarized approach in SDN is no longer operating standalone network devices,
    where connected nature is improving the odds for adversaries to instill malicious
    content or interpose such links (Aujla et al., 2020). Since conventional networks
    were mostly based proprietary devices as in Cisco, Juniper, and NEC, the attackers
    were tasked with revealing vulnerabilities specific to each vendor. This is an
    arduous task, which meant one revealed vulnerability is only applicable to devices
    of a specific vendor. Though with SDN, for maintaining compatibility and interoperability,
    a generic standardization and a set of protocols should be utilized. This fact
    is increasing the vulnerability level of the SDN, where Advanced Persistent Threats
    (APTs) can be targeted to gain access.

- en: Figure 3 indicates diverse threats exploitable by an adversary in a typical
    SDN deployment scenario. The connectivity between the SDN networks elements are
    the most probable threat for an attacker. This link can be subjected to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM), Relay, or APT attacks that result in various consequences. Such consequences
    can be Malicious code injection, Eavesdropping, Sybil, Spoong, Denial of Service
    (DoS), or malware instilling. Due to its dynamic nature in the SDN environment,
    network elements can be subjected to side channel type attacks (Liu, Reiter, &
    Sekar, 2017). Further, a malicious node injected as a network element can be exploited
    to perform either sinkhole or wormhole attacks to manipulate the traffic flows
    (Tselios et al., 2017). In addition, a compromised node can sabotage the performance
    of the entire data plane devices by forging other nodes or cloning; while SDN
    controllers can be exploited appearing as a legitimate node. Multiple and simultaneous
    impersonation attacks can result in a Distributed DoS (DDoS) threat that delay
    the traffic flows while disrupting the provisioned services. The access to SDN
    controllers by physical means are improbable due to their placement in secure
    premises. Their access can be gained from exploiting the vulnerabilities of the
    OF protocols. Appearing as a legitimate network device and authenticating to secure
    the access is an obvious approach for any attacker. Once the access is gained,
    the SDN controller can be overloaded via DoS type attacks. Further, a compromised
    network controllers can delude the controllers in other domains. A resourceful
    attacker capable of launching an impersonation attack as the administrator can
    infiltrate both control and infrastructure planes. The main issue with the SDN
    environment is its lack of trust and accountability model for guaranteeing security
    of consumers.

    underutilization in future wireless networks, integration of cognitive radio (CR)
    technology will provide an effective solution for spectrum scarcity issues faced
    in the future 5G and beyond networks (Hindia et al., 2020). The main objective
    of CR technology is to sense the spectrum from the real time environment and discover
    the non-utilized spectrum. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are intended to be
    able to opportunistically exploit those spectrum holes in order to adapt their
    radio parameters accordingly. To facilitate this task, CR needs accurate and reliable

    according to the environmental conditions and make changes based on their communication
    capabilities. However, the security is susceptible in case of wireless networks
    compared to wired networks. Spectrum management and sensing in CRNs involve various
    control messages. During this process, malicious users may eavesdrop on those
    information, thereby leading to the serious statistical information leakage of
    both licensed and unlicensed users. Consequently, malicious activities need to
    be prevented within the CRN. For instance, a malicious secondary user can eavesdrop
    other users’ signal information and based on that, pretend a false interference
    level. On the other hand, some malicious secondary users may masquerade as a primary
    user to obtain the resource of a given channel by using Physical layer attacks

- en: Threats generated in WSNs follow two customs as the external attacker to the
    network or an internal node which becomes malicious after being invaded. Therefore,
    malicious node detection is key in WSNs to assure the security in operation. It
    has been comprehended using either based on developing trust models or based on
    introducing new WSN protocols. In the former method, trust models were developed
    by accounting trust values with neighbor-weight trust determination (NWTD) algorithm,
    D-S (Dempster-Shafer) evidence theory or fuzzy based multi-attribute trust model,
    etc. Enhanced LEACH protocol to detect energy consumption, distance and malicious
    nodes to ensure the robustness, and new multi-valued trust routing protocol (MTR)
    are some examples for new protocols used for malicious detection (She, et al.,
    2019). Despite the behavioral-based trust models that can be used to monitor the
    network and detect malicious nodes, they are still exposed to malicious attacks
    due to inaccurate location estimates. In order improve the accuracy as well as
    to record the detection process of malicious nodes for later traceability, a hybrid
    blockchain based trust evaluation method of behavioral- and data-based has been
    proposed in (Kim, et al., 2019) as shown in Figure 5\. This rejects malicious
    sensor nodes in network and thus enhances trust relationships among beacon nodes.
    First, a trust value of each beacon node is computed taking into account the metrics
    such as closeness, honesty, intimacy and frequency of interaction and then it

    use cryptographic systems, trust management, centralized routing decisions, etc.
    Although many researchers have suggested third-party intermediaries or management
    centers to resolve the security issues, most of the routing schemes in multi-hop
    distributed WSNs are failed to identify untrusted behaviors of routing nodes dynamically.
    Meanwhile, there is still no effective way to prevent malicious node attacks.
    Therefore, as a trusted, decentralized, self-organizing ledger system, the blockchain
    has shown improved solutions for the security and fairness. By replacing the traditional
    public key infrastructure (PKI) with a blockchain protocol, Gómez-Arevalillo et
    al. has proposed blockchain based public key management framework (SBTM) to remove
    central authentication and to provide a decentralized inter-domain routing system.
    Smart blockchain based contract routing (BCR) has been used in (Ramezan & Leung,
    2018) to record routing nodes with malicious behaviors and thus to help routing
    nodes for finding trusted routes. However, it seems that there is no assurance
    to stop packet forwarding to a malicious node that claims with a BCR token. Therefore,
    there is a need for developing routing algorithms with self-adaptive nature. Therefore,
    Yang et al. has proposed a trusted routing scheme using blockchain together with
    reinforcement learning to improve the credibility of routing information. In here,
    proof of authority (PoA) blockchain is used for easy traceability and to avoid
    any tampering while the reinforcement learning model is used select more trusted
    route dynamically.

    Therefore, it is essential to keep track of packets among sensor nodes to evaluate
    the trustworthiness, probe adversarial conducts and detect communication failures.
    The data provenance normally records the data origin trace back information of
    a packet in accordance with both ownership and the actions taken on them. However,
    the provenance size of a packet significantly grows with the number of transmission
    hops in a selected WSN path, thus creating issues in battery life, communication
    bandwidth, etc. Consequently, it is required to develop data provenance schemes

    the sink node collects and stores data from other nodes before forwarding them
    to other networks. A blockchain based hash computation is used to provide an immutable
    and tamper-resistant storage at the sink node. Another compression free blockchain
    based data provenance scheme (BCP) has been proposed in (Zeng,et al., 2018) where
    provenances are stored distributively on the high performance nodes (H-nodes)
    deployed above or nearby the network along the packet path. Base stations can

    order to verify and secure spectrum sharing between mobile CRs a decentralized
    blockchain database is maintained. The general concept behind this proposed work
    is that spectrum licensees announce the auction of a particular spectrum band
    to the other parties, i.e., secondary users. For this, a common control channel
    is utilized to advertise the available channels and the auction information. The
    bidder(s) who won the bid can purchase the corresponding spectrum via a virtual
    currency known as Specoins. By making the blockchain or through direct exchange,
    secondary users can receive this currency. For instance, A CR can earn Specoins
    via updating the blockchain by utilizing its processing power. In addition, the
    proposed scheme permits conversion of real currency into Specoins by considering
    the secondary users who have a large amount of data to transmit however without

    simulation results obtained, the proposed blockchain-based spectrum allocation
    scheme in (Kotobi & Bilen, 2018) outperforms the conventional CR systems, in terms
    of the amount of transmitted data. However, this throughput improvement is achieved
    at a cost of higher power consumption. An interesting observation made in (Kotobi
    & Bilen, 2018) is that the proposed scheme can provide a higher throughput than
    the existing schemes even at the presence of fading conditions. This study provides
    a basic way of looking into the application of blockchains over the CRNs. It needs

    which measures the average transmission rate per unit of energy consumption used
    for sensing and mining. According to the obtained simulation results, it is observed
    that the sensing-mining energy efficiency does not grow monotonically with the
    increase of the sensing probability of SUs. Indeed, an optimal value of sensing
    probability corresponding to a given maximum energy efficiency can be noticed.

    more practical situations, (Luong et al., 2019) does not completely neglect double-spending
    attacks in which transactions in a block can be maliciously modified during the
    transmission. During the performance evaluation, it can be noticed that the proposed
    machine learning approach enables the SU to achieve the higher number of successful
    transaction transmissions under a lower cost.

    will affect the performance of the network. With blockchain technology, new security
    practices can be realized in the management of this CR spectrum. The goal of this
    section is to investigate the utility of blockchain in CRNs by referring to recently
    performed research work. A summary of the above discussed blockchain-based security

    similar to existing IoT architecture whereas Fog Mining Cluster is dedicated to

- en: In machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, machine-type communication Devices
    (MTDs) are connected and communicated without any human intervention. Therefore,
    applications such as intelligent meters, environmental monitoring and e-health
    systems can allow relatively longer delays in data traffic. As an example, deploying
    smart meters may require data uploads or downloads that happen periodically. However,
    since the MTDs are equipped with limited battery power, data computing tasks cannot
    be cached, processed and executed solely on the local devices. Therefore, the
    best option to offload some of the storage and computation requirements at the
    edge of the network. On the other hand, security and reliability is also a prime
    concern for sensitive data of MTDs. Meng Li et al has proposed a joint optimization
    framework to make optimal decisions about caching servers and computing servers
    as well as to ensure the security in M2M communication networks based on dueling
    deep Q-network (Li,et al., 2020).

    latency issues in cloud computing mainly due to poor wireless connectivity between
    the device and cloud. Rather than depending solely on centralized cloud platforms,
    it is vital to seek solutions that is plausible execute same network operations
    or services closer to the devices. Referring to that, an opportunistic collaborative
    mobile IoT design has been proposed in (Chamarajnagar & Ashok, 2018), to provide
    distributed computing solutions at the edge of the mobile IoT network using the
    blockchain framework. Similar to the previous work, in order to meet the stringent
    latency and bandwidth requirements of next-generation mobile networks, Fog-based
    Radio Access Network (F-RAN) has been proposed in (Jijin, Seet, & Joo Chong, 2019).
    However, this is not entirely identical to conventional F-RAN and virtual Fog
    Access Points (v-FAP) or service nodes formed dynamically with devices placed
    at the local edge are monitored by pre-defined physical or seed nodes. The integrations
    of Opportunistic Fog RAN (OF-RAN) with blockchain smart contracts guarantees the
    verifiable automation of physical processes at edge nodes.

- en: Modern and future communication networks will grow up to billions of interactions
    among machines and sensors. Moreover, future wireless networks are becoming increasingly
    heterogeneous and complicated due to a growing need for ubiquitous access for
    various data sources, which is enabled by advances in modern technologies. Since
    those networks highly utilize the existing wireless sensor technologies, inherently
    it remains exposed to privacy as well as security threats. Wireless nodes in SDNs,
    WSNs as well as CRNs characteristically are considered to be prone to attacks
    such as distributed denial-of-service. Moreover, intelligent wireless nodes in
    those networks are mostly controlled on cloud environments. Such centralized architecture
    also undergoes single point of failure and further adds to vulnerability.

- en: However, prevention of the drawbacks associated with security, privacy and vulnerability
    aspects has become one of the main challenges for those networks. This chapter
    explores existing studies which discuss how to add blockchains to distributed
    systems implemented in SDNs, WSNs and CRNs which can make network operations more
    secure, autonomous, flexible, and profitable. Blockchain provides those networks
    security, anonymity, and data integrity without the involvement of a third party.

    networks are also discussed in brief. The research works presented in this chapter
    show that blockchain can serve as a method to log data in a form highly resistant
    to tampering and as a way to combat the introduction of malicious users into SDN,
    WSN and CRN networks.
