    as to how their rapid growth can influence the environment and through which channels
    this process manifests. While it is not popular discussion among investors, we
    find that environmental issues can be of interest by wider society, students,
    policy makers and stakeholders of FinTech companies. Environmentalism has a long
    history, and controversy around this subject is remains quite substantial, thus
    to not make our discussion over-complicated, in this chapter we will focus on
    the area where to date, we possess the most thorough data and evidence through
    which we can build the case, namely electricity consumption associated with the
    mining of cryptocurrencies. The total carbon footprint of the industry is now
    estimated to have surpassed that of many large industrial nations. This chapter
    investigates the multiple knock-on effects and consequential behaviour of this
    rapid growth in energy usage, such as an increase in global temperature, the growth
    of mining companies who have targeted third world infrastructures, and the complete
    shutdown of the internet as we know it. Saying that, we encourage investors not
    to ignore these environmentalism matters, since we also show that electricity
    consumption is proven to be one of the commonly used variable in valuation of
    mineable cryptocurrencies and identification of their fair value, which affect
    investments returns and should be considered in their trading strategies.

    becoming more certain that innovative solutions are going to be needed to solve
    some substantial forthcoming issues with regards to energy usage and technological
    capacity. The energy usage of Bitcoin mining has increased from 4.8 Twh to 73.12 Twh
    over the last two years, and the whole network now consumes more energy than Austria.[¹](#fn_38)
    The estimated energy footprint per Bitcoin transaction is over 600 Kwt, which
    is estimated to be equivalent to over 300,000 contactless payment transactions,
    or to the power consumption of an average household for over 22 days. Bitcoin
    in its current form is a very expensive transmission mechanism. The major fuel
    used by these networks, due to its relatively majority-based Chinese point of
    origin, is coal-fired power plants, which has resulted in an extensive carbon
    footprint for each transaction. This raises questions about the environmental
    sustainability of cryptocurrencies. The participation in the validation and mining
    process of Bitcoin requires both special hardware and a substantial amount of
    energy, therefore, there is on-going carbon production. The computing power required
    to solve one Bitcoin has quadrupled throughout 2019, compared to the same period
    twelve months previous. This has led to some concern within the sector of the
    imminent need for broad international regulation in a bid to stall such exponential
    growth in energy usage. However, there are difficulties in providing definitive
    estimates. Further, the argument has been even more substantially muddied, as
    cryptocurrency proponents have stated that the usage of renewable energy has not
    been appropriately accounted for.

    academic literature and financial industries. While there are many goals that
    enterprise may have, firms in the financial sector are less likely to directly
    aim at environmental actions without incentivisation, such as improving air and
    water quality, wildlife and habitats protection. Investment companies and funds
    are interested in maximising financial returns and decreasing the risks of investments,
    while incorporation of environmental goals and values into their strategy in majority
    of cases seems unnecessary, excessive, and most importantly, too expensive. This
    is also reflected in the finance research and papers published in reputable finance
    journals, where the majority of those analysing the risk-return characteristics
    of financial assets rather than the environmental implications of their growth.
    However, the situation is ever evolving. With elevated attention to the importance
    of the environment among society, and acknowledgement of the climate change issues
    facing society by the majority of governments and institutions worldwide, we observed
    emergence of environmental and climate finance field, as well as expansion of
    the research addressing urgent multidisciplinary research questions in finance
    and environmental science simultaneously. Corporate social responsibility matters
    shaped not only business and accounting processes, but further encouraged emergence
    of various ethically-cleansed financial assets and instruments, that are available
    for investors, which cause the changes in their investment objectives. The investors
    more often follow the ethical values and beliefs in making investment decisions,
    and environmental factors could be a strong influence.

    industry and its environmental impacts is a significant question. We can only
    guess, but the easiest assumption to make here is that they do not care about
    it. If they do care about the increased mining difficulty and electricity consumption,
    then only in the context of the increased cost of mining and its impact on the
    prices and consequentially investment returns, while wider environmental impacts
    might be not considered. The majority of mining pools are situated in China and
    around 80% of Bitcoins minded there, followed by 10% in Czech Republic, and Iceland,
    Japan, Georgia and Russia account approximately 2% of network hashrate each. The
    location of mining pools matters due to the energy sources, environmental standards,
    and clean energy alternatives available in the countries. Not only the power consumption
    itself is important, but also energy sources which determine the carbon footprint
    of this industry.

    within 22 years if the current rate is similar to some of the slowest broadly

    other technologies have been incorporated. However, this estimates are based on
    assumption that the sources of fuel will be fixed and remained unchanged over
    the target period of time.Thus, it is still possible to decrease the environmental
    impacts of Bitcoin mining and it is critical to explore the ways to decrease the
    carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies.

    and ecological environmentalism, comparing technocentrists and ecocentrists viewpoints
    and beliefs. Technocentrism denotes that humans and technologies can impact environment,
    and by using adequate management we can minimise the negative impacts of economic
    growth on nature. This assumes that humans relationships with environment related
    to utility and usefulness of resources that are provided by nature. Thus, as individuals
    and as society we would care about negative impacts on environment only if we
    are directly benefiting from it and our negative impacts are subsequently reducing
    those benefits. In contrast, ecocentrism provides more romanticised interpretation
    of environmental protection suggesting that it’s moral obligation of all human
    kinds to respect and protect the nature regardless of its use and its value referring
    to wild nature as to integral companion of man. Thus, people should try to avoid
    causing any harm to nature and environments since they are directly harming their
    own natural habitat.

    The machines completing the algorithms consume substantial amounts of energy while
    completing their tasks. New sets of blocks are added to Bitcoin’s blockchain approximately
    every 10 minutes by miners. The code that supports Bitcoin includes several rules
    to validate new transactions. Every miner individually confirms whether transactions
    adhere to these rules, eliminating the need to trust other miners, instead trusting
    the process. Every miner in the network is constantly tasked with preparing the
    next batch of transactions for the blockchain. Only one of these blocks will be
    randomly selected to become the latest block on the chain.

    valid one. The difficulty is regularly adjusted by the protocol to ensure that
    all miners in the network will only produce one valid block every 10 minutes on
    average. Once one of the miners finally manages to produce a valid block, it will
    inform the rest of the network and other miners will accept this block once they
    confirm it adheres to all rules, and then discard whatever block they had been
    working on themselves. The lucky miner gets rewarded with a fixed amount of coins,
    along with the transaction fees belonging to the processed transactions in the
    new block. Then the cycle begins once again.

    can provide a solid stream of revenue, these miners are very willing to run machines
    that consume substantial amounts of energy in an attempt to generate reward. Over
    the years this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network
    to grow to unsustainable levels, as the price of the currency reached new highs.
    It is widely considered that Bitcoin alone uses more power when mining than that
    of countries such as the Philippines, Chile, Venezuela, the Czech Republic and
    Austria. Bitcoin’s biggest problem is perhaps not even its massive energy consumption,
    but the fact most mining facilities in Bitcoin’s network are located in regions
    that rely heavily on coal-based power. A Bitcoin ASIC miner will, once turned
    on, not be switched off until it either breaks down or becomes unable to mine
    Bitcoin at a profit. Because of this, Bitcoin miners increase both the baseload
    demand on a grid, as well as the need for alternative (fossil-fuel based) energy
    sources to meet this demand when renewable energy production is low. In the worst
    case scenario, the presence of Bitcoin miners may thus provide an incentive for
    the construction of new coal-based power plants, or reopening existing ones. This
    impact would be even harder to quantify.

    it would be profitable to use almost all the electricity currently generated in
    the world for mining. The bank views the latter prospect as not worth worrying
    about, for two reasons: it doesn’t think bitcoin will ever reach that value, since
    the competition from other cryptocurrencies is too strong; and it thinks that
    power consumption of mining will fall over time as better technologies are used
    for miners. Credit Suisse explicitly compares bitcoin to marijuana cultivation

    such as Ethereum. Ethereum has plans to change its proof-of-work algorithm to
    an energy efficient proof-of-stake algorithm called Casper. This change would
    minimise energy consumption and will be implemented gradually. For now, Ethereum
    is still running on proof-of-work completely. In its current state the entire
    Ethereum network consumes more electricity than a number of countries, based on
    a report published by the International Energy Agency while Bitcoin had been estimated
    to use 73 TWh per year, Ethereum’s power usage was substantially lower at 7.65 TWh
    per year. Proof-of-work was the first consensus algorithm that managed to prove
    itself, but it is not the only consensus algorithm. More energy efficient algorithms,
    like proof-of-stake, have been in development over recent years. In proof-of-stake
    coin owners create blocks rather than miners, thus not requiring power hungry
    machines that produce as many hashes per second as possible. Because of this,
    the energy consumption of proof-of-stake is negligible compared to proof-of-work.
    Bitcoin could potentially switch to such an consensus algorithm, which would significantly
    improve sustainability. The only downside is that there are many different versions
    of proof-of-stake, and none of these have fully proven themselves yet. Nevertheless
    the work on these algorithms offers good hope for the future.

    are imminently necessary to solve some substantial forthcoming issues. The energy
    use of Bitcoin mining has increased from 4.8 Twh to 68.9 Twh over the last two
    years and the whole network now consumes more energy than Czech Republic. The
    energy footprint per Bitcoin transaction is now in excess of 500 Kwt, which is
    equivalent to 350,000 visa transactions. Energy wise, Bitcoin in an expensive
    transmission mechanism. Nowadays, most mining pools, i. e. groups of miners working
    in specialised warehouses with extensive amounts of mining hardware, are situated
    in China. The major fuel used by these networks is thus from coal-fired power
    plants, which results in an extensive carbon footprint for each transaction. Some
    estimates say more than 60 percent of the processing power used to mine bitcoin
    is in China, where it relies heavily on the burning of coal. An estimated 85%
    of cryptocurrency mining occurs in China, where electricity is cheap and largely
    sourced from environmentally unsustainable sources like coal-powered plants. As
    the cryptocurrency industry grows, and the adoption of blockchain technology increases,
    it is increasingly important for cryptocurrencies’ blockchain technology to be
    more environmentally conscious. By prioritising efficiency, these new cryptocurrencies
    also reduce their environmental impact. In doing so, the industry neatly exemplifies
    how improving the environmental output of an industry can be linked to enhanced
    productivity and effectiveness. Coal and other fossil fuels are also the largest
    generator of electricity for the rest of the world, and coal is a significant
    contributor to man-made climate change. Burning it produces carbon dioxide, a
    gas that is a primary contributor to global warming. This reliance on fossil fuels
    has given rise to speculation that bitcoin’s energy consumption will continue
    to rise as it grows in popularity. This raises questions about the environmental
    sustainability of cryptocurrencies.

    research of renewable energy usage, it is highly probable given the relatively
    small share of renewable in most countries with large mining pools that the net
    effects of the growth of cryptocurrency is carbon positive and detrimental to
    our environment at its current rate of growth. This research sets out to specifically
    investigate as to whether the price volatility effects of such cryptocurrencies,
    proxied by Bitcoin, has generated dynamic correlations with electricity and utilities
    providers in countries that contain the largest international mining pools. Such
    increased demand through the cryptocurrency mining process should theoretically
    manifest in changing financial dynamics for these identified companies. We have
    also selected to investigate as to whether any dynamic relationship exists between

    2) hashrate; 3) the number of daily transactions; 4) the number of unique Bitcoin
    mining addresses and 5) block size of Bitcoin. Through each particular variable,
    we observe the growing maturity of this new financial product over time. Mining
    difficulty reflects how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest
    that it could be, recalculated every 2016 blocks to a value such that the previous
    2016 blocks would have been generated in exactly two weeks had everyone been mining
    at the same difficulty. As more miners join, the rate of block creation will increase,
    which causes the difficulty to increase in compensation to push the rate of block
    creation back down. A hash is the output of a hash function, and the hashrate
    is the speed at which a compute is completing an operation in the Bitcoin code.
    A higher hashrate when mining increases your opportunity of finding the next block
    and receiving the reward. The increased difficulty in mining has led to a need
    for more powerful technology and increased energy usage to mine cryptocurrency.
    Of course, the source of this additional required energy is central to the issues
    that Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies, faces.

- en: As of December 2019, it has been estimated that annualised global revenue available
    through the mining of Bitcoin alone was estimated to be $5.4 billion. The global
    estimated cost to generate this revenue is approximately $3.9 billion. Consider
    this, with one cryptocurrency, the potential rewards for mining is a spoil of
    a pool of $1.5 billion. Considering the incredibly rapid growth in the number
    of cryptocurrencies that exist today, it is easy to comprehend as to how large
    this market, and the profits that exist for the most efficient miners in the market.
    It is this market efficiency that has come into sharp focus with costs accounting
    for approximately 70% of revenues. Much of the cost surrounds the technological
    challenges that miners face. In terms of mining cryptocurrency, substantial energy
    is allocated towards heat reduction. Countries with warmer climates have been
    broadly linked with substantial technological issues and machine malfunctions.
    While considering that a basic miner can use approximately 1,500 watts per hour,
    much of this energy is converted directly to heat output, which can be in excess
    of 5,000 BTU per hour. When considering the fact that some mines possess up to
    5,000 of these miners in close proximity, it is very easy to quickly identify
    the scale of the temperature issues that are faced. The task is not aimed at cooling
    the air, but rather to evacuate it from the areas surrounding the miners using
    industrial fans. Evaporative coolers are then used to cool the physical infrastructure
    surrounding the miners, controlling for moisture and evaporation from the heat
    exchange which can create disastrous consequences for the electrical infrastructure.
    If for example, a mine consumes 40 MW of electricity per hour, and given an energy
    consumption of about 1,500 watts per hour per Bitcoin mining machine, these miners
    can consume over 75% of the electricity consumption with regards to the cryptocurrency
    mining process. Therefore, the cooling process of the miners can account for up
    to 25% of the total energy usage costs of a mine. We must further consider as
    to how hard these miners are working. In some cases, to reduce machine wear-and-tear,
    some miners are set to run below their maximum operating capacity. This would
    cause such cooling estimates to vary quite considerably. For example, some mining
    machines have controllers that gauges the ambient temperature and sets the fan
    speed and the voltage and clock speed of the machine accordingly. During periods
    of warm weather, this process will result in mining machines running at slower
    speeds (as measured in terahashes per second) to keep the chips cooler and reduce
    the risk of significant damage.

    a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin’s blockchain
    based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility
    operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption
    estimate into carbon emissions, using the localisation of IP addresses. We determine
    the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh
    and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 Mt <math altimg="../graphic/b_9783110660807-009_ineq_006.png"

    that should be considered by policymakers. As of late 2019, the total network

    characteristics surrounding this new product in Figures [2](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_002)
    through [5](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_005). As Bitcoin obtained more attention
    as a new financial product, its internal structure changed quite substantially.
    With this added attention developed a sharp increase in the number of transactions,
    trading volume and mining processes associated. In [Figure 2](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_002)
    we identify the number of Bitcoins in circulation, with evidence of sharply elevated
    growth rates in the period between 2010 and 2013\. However, in the period since
    2017, this growth rate has somewhat plateaued. In [Figure 3](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_003),
    we observe the USD ($) exchange traded value of Bitcoin. As expected, during the
    sharp price appreciation of late-2017, the value of the market grew from approximately
    $1 billion to almost $5 billion. In [Figure 4](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_004),
    we observe some of the key statistics with regards to blockchain size. As of late-2019,
    the blockchain size of Bitcoin grew above 250 GB, while the average block size
    exceeded 1.20 MB per transaction. In [Figure 5](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_005),
    we observe the average number of transactions per block which has consistently
    exceeded 1,000 transactions since late 2015, and has been above 2,000 transactions
    since mid-2018\. Throughout 2019, the median confirmation time has averaged approximately
    seven minutes, which was the consistently average range experienced between 2013
    and late-2017\. Miner’s revenue has also be consistently above $5,000 since Q2
    2017, peaking during the period in which Bitcoin prices almost reached $20,000.

    regards to transaction fees in the market for Bitcoin. We observe that the total
    transaction fees grew quite substantially during periods of sharp price appreciation,
    reaching over $20 million in late-2017\. However, we also observe that cost as
    a proportion of the transaction volume has sharply declined over time while the
    cost per transaction has increased to a sustained high level since early-2017\.
    In [Figure 7](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_007), we can clearly identify the sharp
    growth in interest in the mining of Bitcoin as a product. There has been a consistent
    level of growth in the number of unique addresses mining the product, peaking
    during the largest price appreciations in Bitcoin. The has been echoed by the
    confirmed transactions per day in Bitcoin and the total number of transactions.
    In [Figure 8](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_008), we see the behaviour of the number
    of unspent transaction output (UTXO) which is an abstraction of Electronic Money.
    Each UTXO represents a chain of ownership implemented as a chain of Digital Signatures
    where the owner signs a message (transaction) transferring ownership of their
    UTXO to the receiver’s Public Key. The total UTXOs present in a blockchain represent
    a set, every transaction thus consumes elements from this set and creates new
    ones that are added to the set. The set thus represents all the coins in the system.
    In early-2018, while Bitcoin prices starts to decline from lifetime highs, the
    UTXO declined in a similar fashion, remaining elevated during some periods of
    short-term panic in mid-2019, but being quite low otherwise. Further, the mempool
    size, representing the aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed
    has had a number of short-term spikes value over the past three years as measured
    in bytes per second. These large spikes can indicate that a number of miners have
    left the process. Further, the spike could also mean that the Bitcoin protocol
    is under threat, simply because transactions are not processing at their usual
    pace. It is also possible that the spike is because someone is spamming the network
    on purpose, to either raise fees or prevent certain transactions from processing.

    which has been at a lifetime high of almost 70 million outputs in late-2019\.
    Further, we observe the output value, which contains instructions for sending
    bitcoins. The value is the number of Satoshi (1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshi) that
    this output will be worth when claimed. ScriptPubKey is the second half of a script
    and there can be more than one output, and they share the combined value of the
    inputs. Because each output from one transaction can only ever be referenced once
    by an input of a subsequent transaction, the entire combined input value needs
    to be sent in an output if you don’t want to lose it. There have been a number
    of distinct, sharp increases in this value, most notably in early-2016 and mid-2019\.
    In [Figure 10](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_010), we observe that the estimated transaction
    value has reduced consistently over time, however, as the price of Bitcoin increased,
    so did the estimated USD($) transaction value. Finally, [Figure 11](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_011)
    presents the user count of blockchain wallet users over time. We can clearly see
    a sharp growth of user numbers in the period since 2014, peaking in excess of
    45 million in the period since early-2019.

    to be in excess of 6.3 trillion kW hours per year. This is followed by the United
    States, then India, Russia and Japan. It is important to note that Japanese power
    consumption is almost twice that of the next group of countries that includes
    Germany, Canada, Brazil and South Korea. When considering the average electrical

    other middle eastern nations such as Qatar present evidence of substantially reduced
    household charges for electricity. Germany represents the most expensive country
    to buy domestic electricity per kW, closely followed by Denmark, Belgium, Portugal,
    Jamaica and Japan. In terms of the business charges in [Table 3](#b_9783110660807-009_tab_003),
    although rates are broadly reduced in comparison to household estimates, Denmark
    is the most expensive at US$0.28 per kW. This is closely followed by Jamaica and
    Costa Rica. In terms of the cheapest countries in which to buy electricity, Venezuela,
    Libya and Ethiopia represent the cheapest countries in which to run potential
    cryptocurrency mining operations.

    pool is a joint group of cryptocurrency miners who combine their computational
    resources over a network. Individually, participants in a mining pool contribute
    their processing power toward the effort of finding a block. If the pool is successful
    in these efforts and is rewarded with cryptocurrency tokens as a result, the mining
    pool divides up these rewards to individuals who contributed according to the
    proportion of each individual’s processing power or work relative to the whole
    group. In some cases, individual miners must show proof of work in order to receive
    their rewards. There are broadly three types of mining pools: 1) Proportional
    mining pools are among the most common. In this type of pool, miners contributing
    to the pool’s processing power receive shares up until the point at which the
    pool succeeds in finding a block. After that, miners receive rewards proportional
    to the number of shares they hold; 2) Pay-per-share pools operate somewhat similarly
    in that each miner receives shares for his or her contribution. However, these
    pools provide instant payouts regardless of when the block is found. A miner contributing
    to this type of pool can exchange shares for proportional payout at any time;
    and 3) Peer-to-peer mining pools aim to prevent the pool structure from becoming
    centralised. As such, they integrate a separate blockchain related to the pool
    itself and designed to prevent the operators of the pool from cheating as well
    as the pool itself from failing due to a single central issue.'

- en: While success in individual mining grants lead to complete ownership of the
    reward, the probability of achieving success is very low because of high power
    and resource requirements. Further, due to the increasing difficulty of mining
    in recent years as popularity of these digital currencies has grown, mining is
    often not a profitable venture for individuals. The costs associated with expensive
    hardware necessary to be a competitive miner as well as electricity oftentimes
    outweigh the potential rewards. The benefits of mining pools are found within
    a number of key characteristics. First, they require less of each individual participant
    in terms of hardware and electricity costs, thereby increasing the chances of
    profitability. Whereas an individual miner might stand little chance of successfully
    finding a block and receiving a mining reward, a mining pool dramatically improves
    the success rate as the cumulative effort leads to better chances of finding a
    block, though the joint effort comes at the cost of shared reward. However, by
    taking part in a mining pool, individuals give up some of their autonomy in the
    mining process. They are typically bound by rules established within the pool
    while they are further required to share any potential rewards, which reduces
    profits in comparison to working alone.

- en: As we have been developing, cryptocurrency miners seek low cost electricity
    and permissive policy environments, which can also unfortunately create environmental
    hazards and substantial impacts upon local consumers without producing any benefit
    for communities. The energy needs of these miners means that mining is in fact
    quite mobile. China has been a dominant force in the cryptocurrency industry,
    acting as a home to the world’s largest Bitcoin mining companies. Regions such
    as the Xinjiang or Sichuan possess substantial surplus energy which can be made
    available to these mobile mining operations. Since 2018, China has however begun
    to exert regulatory pressure on provincial governments to encourage the closure
    of crypto mining operations and has withdrawn incentivised taxation offers. Further,
    China has consistently attempted to enact financial regulations on cryptocurrencies.
    Notably, The People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank, implemented measures
    prohibiting domestic Bitcoin exchanges and banning the practice of raising public
    funds for the development new cryptocurrencies, while China’s financial regulatory
    measures have been found to correlate with depreciation in Bitcoin’s value. Due
    to these issues and similar problems in North America and Western Europe, these
    operators have been continuing to explicitly seek out countries with looser regulatory
    environments and physical environments that favour the cost of crypto-mining production.

    that generates approximately 90% of its energy production from renewable resources,
    thereby accounting for 43% of global Bitcoin mining operations. The profitability
    of cryptocurrency mining is dependent on the currency’s market value in concurrence
    with the price of electricity. The most efficient mining operations are those
    that can operate at the lowest cost by obtaining the cheapest electricity capable
    of supporting extreme consumption. As a result, miners seek cheap electricity
    markets while benefiting from policy environments that do not regulate the ways
    in which electricity can be consumed. This can manifest in a number of quite unusual
    outcomes. With regards to countries without substantial asset resorts, the Democratic
    Republic of Congo for example, has been linked with a number of substantial projects
    that could help to protect children there from forced labour.

    to possess in excess of half of the world’s cobalt resources, which will become
    ever more valuable as companies attempt to develop electric cars. Other substantial
    issues have been identified in Venezuela, where hyperinflation has prompted dramatic
    shortages of basic necessities and food, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could
    help ease the strain. Given its global usage and the relative ease of cross-border
    payments and transfers, cryptocurrency has been a viable alternative to an increasingly
    problematic local fiat money for many Venezuelan citizens. The Petro (PTR) has
    its origin in the idea of president Hugo Chavez of a strong currency backed by
    raw materials. The blockchain allows the transfer of value and information, without
    third parties, they provide the tools to successfully face the challenge of creating
    platforms and financial instruments that are transparent, efficient and inclusive.
    Petro was aimed to be a sovereign crypto asset backed by oil assets and issued
    by the Venezuelan State as a spearhead for the development of an independent,
    transparent and open digital economy open to the direct participation of citizens.
    It is also aimed to serve as a platform for the growth of a fairer financial system
    that contributes to development, autonomy and trade between emerging economies.
    Venezuelan oil assets will be used to promote the adoption of crypto assets and
    technologies based on the country’s blockchain. The ambition of the State is to
    promote and encourage the use of Petro with a view to consolidating it as an investment
    option, savings mechanism and means of exchange with State services, industry,
    commerce, and citizens in general. Petro aspired to be an instrument for to develop
    Venezuela’s economic stability and financial independence, while also providing
    an opportunity to create a freer, more balanced and fairer international financial
    system.

    miners compete to complete complex mathematical calculations to get the right
    to add a ‘block’ to the blockchain. The addition of the block stores information
    about a transaction, and the winning miner is rewarded for its work. The rise
    in cryptocurrency mining can therefore be seen as environmentally damaging in
    two ways. Firstly, the mining of cryptocurrency requires substantial volumes of
    electricity. Secondly, cryptocurrency mines are distributed in a way that enables
    them to take advantage of cheap electricity in countries that utilise power generation
    from non-renewable resources such as coal, effectively giving the industry a commercial
    preference towards unsustainable energy. Additionally, bitcoin mining falls outside
    conventional environmental regulatory frameworks designed to address traditional
    mining. While the physical damage on-site remains minimal, the indirect environmental
    damage these mines produce as a result of their electricity consumption remains
    unchecked. Similarly, bitcoin miners are not required to offset or mitigate their
    electricity consumption as other forms of mining or even industrial operations
    may be required to do. Consequently, not only do bitcoin mines use vast amounts
    of electricity, they are not held to any form of environmental standard for either
    where they source their electricity, nor are they required to mitigate the environmental
    damage they cause.

- en: In a 2018 study that examined the entire chain of events that leads to the creation
    of Bitcoin, researchers at University of Hawaii at Manoa[³](#fn_40) examined how
    the projected growth of this cryptocurrency would harm the climate. By way of
    comparison, the scientists compiled data on the uptake of forty different technologies
    ranging from dishwashers and e-books to electric power and the Internet. Compiling
    data on the electricity consumption of the various computing systems used for
    Bitcoin verification at present and the emissions from electricity production
    in the countries of the companies that performed such computing, the authors estimated
    that in 2017, Bitcoin usage emitted 69 MtCO2e. They used this information to estimate
    the rate of uptake this cryptocurrency will see in the coming years. Based on
    their most conservative appraisal, the team found that the cumulative emissions
    from bitcoin would be enough to push global warming beyond 2C in 22 years. If
    the average rate of technology uptake is used instead, this number is closer to
    16 years. To work it out, the scientists analysed the power efficiency of computers
    used in bitcoin mining, the location of miners around the world and the CO2 emissions
    from electricity in those countries. The finding that emissions from an expanding
    bitcoin could push the Earth beyond 2C of warming above the pre-industrial level
    is particularly stark given the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent
    report on the impacts of such a temperature rise. The report’s authors warned
    that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, such as coral reef extinction
    and Arctic ice disappearance, warming must be limited to 1.5C. Though bitcoin
    has growing rapidly in the decade since it was introduced, this growth has somewhat
    stagnated over the past 10 months, suggesting fears about its climate impacts
    may be premature. However, this research was met with some opposition. Given the
    decentralised nature of Bitcoin and the need to maximise economic profits, its
    computing verification process is likely to migrate to places where electricity
    is cheaper, suggesting that electricity de-carbonisation could help to mitigate
    Bitcoin’s carbon footprint — but only where the cost of electricity from renewable
    sources is cheaper than fossil fuels. One of the key arguments proposed by opponents
    surrounded the efficiency of the mining process. While the future growth of cryptocurrencies
    like bitcoin is highly unpredictable, we do know that the global electric power
    sector is de-carbonising and that information technologies, including cryptocurrency
    mining rigs, are becoming much more energy efficient.

    development of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies provide has provided much substantial
    debate. However, at times, it has often teetered somewhat on brink of exceptionally
    alarmist and sensationalist accusations, such as that which accused Bitcoin of
    containing enough disruptive force to hinder and even stop the functionality of
    the Internet. This accusation obtained far more credibility when in June 2018,
    the Bank of International Settlements released a report[⁴](#fn_41) which stated
    that amongst a number of substantial concerns, the rapid growth of Bitcoin could
    generate substantial issues with regards to the functionality of the Internet.
    One of the key elements of the report read: “To process the number of digital
    retail transactions currently handled by selected national retail payment systems,
    even under optimistic assumptions, the size of the ledger would swell well beyond
    the storage capacity of a typical smartphone in a matter of days, beyond that
    of a typical personal computer in a matter of weeks and beyond that of servers
    in a matter of months. But the issue goes well beyond storage capacity, and extends
    to processing capacity: only supercomputers could keep up with verification of
    the incoming transactions. *The associated communication volumes could bring the
    Internet to a halt, as millions of users exchanged files on the order of magnitude
    of a terabyte*.” This would manifest through the need for an incredible amount
    of computer storage for major cryptocurrencies to keep up with the speed of transaction-processing
    systems that are currently in place. This finding presents a major issue for the
    process surround the scaling-up of cryptocurrencies. Each miner is required to
    download and verify the history of all transactions ever made, including amount
    paid, payer, payee and other details. The issues then surrounds the growth of
    this enormous history, with every transaction more information, the ledger continues
    to grow substantially as time passes. As of January 2020, the size of the Bitcoin
    blockchain alone was 240 GB. [Figure 12](#b_9783110660807-009_fig_012) presents
    the estimated energy consumption that this represents between 2017 and 2019\.
    Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, for example,
    were 181 GB, 22 GB, 158 GB respectively. To deal with this issue, cryptocurrencies
    have limits on the throughput of transactions in order to keep the size and of
    the ledger and the time needed to verify all transactions manageable.'

    throughout, one can easily understand how quickly that the size of the cryptocurrency
    ledger would overwhelm the storage capacity of such technology, it presents a
    clear example as to how the continued evolution of digital technology could actually
    lead to substantial issues without further technological evolution. Despite this
    extremely negative finding, the BIS did however add that blockchain and its associated
    distributed ledger technology could provide some benefits for the global financial
    system. It stated that the software have the potential to make the sending of
    cross-border payments more efficient, and with the regards to international flows
    could improve the exporting and importing industry.

    it is assumed that the market participant will acquire information about the externalities
    on a voluntary basis, while then working to solve them without government involvement.
    Generally, such markets often become more efficient over time as they will theoretically
    correct government failures. The process of mining somewhat counteracts this theory.
    Bitcoin’s blockchain system involves multiple miners competing to be first to
    successfully undertake verification work, where only the first successful miner
    will be rewarded, leading to significant delays in transaction processing times
    and costs. To counteract this, miners have become innovative and developed the
    technology that they use, but this advancement on its own is not enough. This
    approach remains problematic as it relies on the market naturally identifying
    cost driven solutions that are also environmentally beneficial. As outlined, this
    can work, but the most cost-effective solution will not always be an environmentally
    beneficial one, particularly as the cost-driven approach in the past has been
    for mining to occur in low cost jurisdictions like China, where the environmental
    costs of bitcoin mining are more pronounced. If markets identified more commercially
    effective means of improving efficiency this may see progress towards more environmentally
    efficient outcomes stall.
  prefs: []

- en: The alternative solution is to implement government regulation. Regulatory frameworks
    can help to internalise environmental costs, so that commercial-effective solutions
    directly take into account environmentally-effective ones. Such frameworks can
    introduce rules and requirements which have the effect of better controlling or
    mitigating the environmental impacts of cryptocurrency while they could also include
    conventional cap and trade schemes designed specifically for the cryptocurrency
    industry, to control the amount of electricity used by bitcoin mines. Alternatively
    (or additionally), incentivising the use of clean energy sources in bitcoin mining
    could be further encouraged as a more environmentally conscious developments in
    the industry. If one country introduces onerous regulations to improve the environmental
    impacts of cryptocurrencies, and this comes at a commercial cost, cryptocurrency
    miners may move offshore to a country that does not enforce or have such regulations
    in place (broadly like miners did to utilise low cost electricity in China). Regulations
    must therefore take into account the unconventional nature of bitcoin mines and
    their ability to easily relocate if regulations are unfavourable. Globally coordinated
    efforts to regulate cryptocurrency’s environmental impacts may mitigate this outcome,
    though present regulatory agreement and diverse policy approaches make this unlikely
    in the short term. However, there are many other issues that must be addressed
    in a regulatory construct in advance of such deep-rooted industrial concerns.
    There have bee many issues with the generation of fake ICOs, where energy is wasted
    in a manner that eventually leads to those operating the ICO simply walking away
    with the funds of unsuspecting investors. Such types of fraud have been exceptionally
    damaging for the industry at large, creating a broad opinion that cryptocurrencies
    have been ripe with fraud. This image was not helped as substantial rumours began,
    later supported by evidence that the exchanges had been largely driven by fake
    volumes traded. There are now developing broad fears that such interactions might
    have been misstated due to the widespread allegations that now exist based on
    the presence of fake volumes. In a recent SEC report,[⁵](#fn_42) Bitwise Asset
    Management examined exchanges for fake volume, and found that roughly 95% of reported
    trading volume in Bitcoin is fake or non-economic in nature. Bitwise used screen
    scrapers to collect live trading data from over eighty exchanges for a period
    of several months. The only ten exchanges that passed Bitwise’s tests were Binance,
    Bitfinex, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, bitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex.
    This research compared the number of website visits to trading volume across exchanges
    to identify suspects that participate in faking trading volume, as indicated by
    disproportionately high volume relative to website visits. In all, the report
    utilises forty-eight cryptocurrency exchanges, focusing on monthly traffic between
    November 2018 and April 2019\. There were nearly 800 million cryptocurrency exchange
    website visits in that time period, while the total reported trading volume was
    $1.96 trillion, of which only $272.5 billion appears to be real trading volume
    on non-volume faking exchanges. About 86% of the trading volume looks to be fake
    with 65% of that total real volume originating on Binance and Bitfinex, both of
    which have virtually no regulatory oversight. Such fake volume is found to be
    either the fraudulent movement of cash or those generated from washing trades
    as per the definition in the Bitwise Report[⁶](#fn_43) who also argues that the
    prices on exchanges with fake volume do not influence the price of bitcoin in
    the real spot market.

    would necessitate deep-rooted exchange regulation. Almost all foreign exchange
    flows through banks or currency houses where all transactions should run through
    an exchange that is regulated. In recent times, British banks are turning away
    cryptocurrency exchanges, and even closing customers’ accounts for wiring to an
    exchange, so even if they’d prefer to be based in the UK, exchanges have to open
    accounts in mainland European countries such as Slovenia. Without tight regulation,
    they fear the funds could be used by criminals on the dark web or for money laundering.
    If they are part of that process, they could get fined or shut down. Exchanges
    should then be allowed to manage ICOs, to reduce the number of fake or fraudulent
    ICOs that exist. Investors would then follow Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money
    Laundering processes. Many of the warnings issued by various countries also note
    the opportunities that cryptocurrencies create for illegal activities, such as
    money laundering and terrorism. Some of the countries surveyed go beyond simply
    warning the public and have expanded their laws on money laundering, counter-terrorism,
    and organized crimes to include cryptocurrency markets, and require banks and
    other financial institutions that facilitate such markets to conduct all the due
    diligence requirements imposed under such laws. For instance, Australia, Canada,
    and the Isle of Man recently enacted laws to bring cryptocurrency transactions
    and institutions that facilitate them under the ambit of money laundering and
    counter-terrorist financing laws. Some jurisdictions have gone even further and
    imposed restrictions on investments in cryptocurrencies, the extent of which varies
    from one jurisdiction to another. Some (Algeria, Bolivia, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan,
    and Vietnam) ban any and all activities involving cryptocurrencies. Qatar and
    Bahrain have a slightly different approach in that they bar their citizens from
    engaging in any kind of activities involving cryptocurrencies locally, but allow
    citizens to do so outside their borders. There are also countries that, while
    not banning their citizens from investing in cryptocurrencies, impose indirect
    restrictions by barring financial institutions within their borders from facilitating
    transactions involving cryptocurrencies (Bangladesh, Iran, Thailand, Lithuania,
    Lesotho, China, and Colombia).

    ambiguity with regards to cryptocurrencies. Blockchains do not work without a
    token, and tokens need to be traded in and out of fiat (government backed currencies
    like the US dollar). This means there will always be a chance to profit (in fiat
    terms), so governments needs to clarify their stance. One of the many questions
    that arise from allowing investments in and the use of cryptocurrencies is the
    issue of taxation. In this regard the challenge appears to be how to categorise
    cryptocurrencies and the specific activities involving them for purposes of taxation.
    This matters primarily because whether gains made from mining or selling cryptocurrencies
    are categorised as income or capital gains invariably determines the applicable
    tax bracket. One, singular universal approach might warrant further investigation
    when analysing the variety of tax treatments for cryptocurrency. For example,
    in the UK, when using cryptocurrencies, corporations pay corporate tax, unincorporated
    businesses pay income tax, individuals pay capital gains tax. While in Argentina
    and Spain, the assets are subject to income tax, while in Denmark they are subject
    to income tax with the losses deducted. In Israel, they are taxed as an asset,
    in Bulgaria cryptocurrency is taxed as a financial asset, while in Switzerland
    they are taxed as foreign currency. It is very easy to see how the broad treatment
    of cryptocurrency can be deemed to be confusing, but also possessing many pathways
    through which illicit behaviour can occur once international tax treaty’s and
    cross-border transfer legislation is also considered. Such international tax revenue
    could also be best served to be partially ring-fenced, acting as an insurance
    policy for any potential environmental damage that cryptocurrencies could generate.
    However, such legislative behaviour would necessitate a standardisation of the
    international approach.

    becoming more certain that innovative solutions are going to be needed to solve
    some substantial forthcoming issues with regards to energy usage and technological
    capacity. The major fuel used by these networks, due to its relatively majority-based
    Chinese point of origin, is coal-fired power plants, which has resulted in an
    extensive carbon footprint for each transaction. This raises questions about the
    environmental sustainability of cryptocurrencies. The participation in the validation
    and mining process of Bitcoin requires both special hardware and a substantial
    amount of energy, therefore, there is on-going carbon production. As the cryptocurrency
    industry grows, and the adoption of blockchain technology increases, it is increasingly
    important for cryptocurrencies’ blockchain technology to be more environmentally
    conscious. By prioritising efficiency, these new cryptocurrencies also reduce
    their environmental impact. In doing so, the industry neatly exemplifies how improving
    the environmental output of an industry can be linked to enhanced productivity
    and effectiveness. Coal and other fossil fuels are also the largest generator
    of electricity for the rest of the world, and coal is a significant contributor
    to man-made climate change. This reliance on fossil fuels has given rise to speculation
    that bitcoin’s energy consumption will continue to rise as it grows in popularity.
    This raises questions about the environmental sustainability of cryptocurrencies.

    Venezuela, Libya and Ethiopia represent the cheapest countries in which to run
    potential cryptocurrency mining operations. This makes such countries attractive
    to cryptocurrency miners. However, the political stability of some might not be

    substantial electricity consumption from coal in countries such as China. Further
    investigation of these issues are exceptionally important, as should they continue
