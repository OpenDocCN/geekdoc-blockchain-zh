- en: Although telemedicine is still practiced today, high-speed connections and improved
    organizational capability have enabled remote operation of medical equipment,
    known as telerobotic surgery. The technologies have a number of benefits, including
    enhanced performance and the ability to reach complex operations to geographically
    isolated places where trained surgeons are unavailable. This study proposed an
    early robotic solution for limited teleoperation tasks in a complex and unpredictable
    environment. So, the research is inspired by future human-robot collaboration.
    It focuses on limiting or preventing accidents between the robot and its environment.
    In order to enable access to robotic surgery equipment in a confined area, a fuzzy
    control method is used. We may infer that an adaptive robotic system capable of
    accomplishing limited tasks while also responding to external factors in an unpredictable
    and dynamic environment is potentially feasible.

- en: 'Teleoperated robotic systems have attracted the attention of many people during
    the last two decades due to their numerous medical and non-medical uses. The emergence
    of robots in medicine has opened new opportunities for advancement, not just in
    terms of surgeon precision and comfort, but also in terms of patient benefits.
    In terms of health applications, two major groups may be distinguished: remote
    - controlled surgery and teleoperated recovery robotic systems, both of which
    have shown significant potential in terms of improving healthcare delivery. Teleoperated
    surgery has been extensively researched and marketed in this line. The sensory-motor
    capabilities of humans have been significantly enhanced by telerobotic systems.
    The capacity of humans to attain increased sensorimotor abilities, allowing them
    to connect with things and places from a distance (Mehrdad et al., 2021). Authors
    in the domains of image analysis, machine learning, and automation have moved
    to geometric technologies for collecting and analysing images as a result of recent
    developments in technology in terms of memory and processing capability. In automation
    and immersive virtual reality research, information technology is employed to
    give efficient solutions in clinical imaging, practical surveillance, automation,
    and computer aided manufacturing (Thilahar & Thilahar, 2019).'

    module. The human operator will control the master unit, and the slave system
    will follow the master robot's actions for interaction with the environment. During
    surgery, the operative region is frequently the patient's body portion on which
    the procedure is being conducted. The operator will get sensory information from
    the operating area in feedback loop. The sensory information repeated by the leader
    robot for the operator allows her/him to complete the operation. In reality, the
    most serious worry with human-robot collaboration is safety (Haddadin & Hirzinger,
    2010; Haddadin et al., 2009).

    medical surgery. Remotely placed hospitals usually have limited resources and
    skilled physicians on a worldwide scale. This successful study demonstrates the
    feasibility and possibility of using telerobotic devices for telesurgery in rural
    and underserved locations. The fundamental issue in this scenario was a large
    delay. Despite these enlightening tests, current standard practice demands that
    the patient and the surgeon be at the same hospital. Robots solved the majority
    of the tasks that could not previously be completed due to security concerns (Bauer
    et al., 2008; Hägele et al., 2002). Researchers addressed the difficulty of safe
    human-robot interaction in 2017 while designing architecture for operating a teleoperated
    industrial manipulator used in surgical applications (Capolei et al., 2017). The
    investigation's goal was to insert and position a long and light surgical instrument,
    the laparoscope, properly and safely through a small incision in the patient's
    skin, which serves as the fulcrum point for tool motions. This eventually brought
    into question the idea of human interaction, as well as the design of a system
    that was reactive and safe enough while dealing with several constraints in such
    a sensitive and unpredictable situation. This challenging issue needs a well-organized
    architectural design capable of managing several events in real time. Telesurgery
    offers the ability to enable the “global exchange of medical expertise without
    the need for specialists to visit.” Another reason surgical telerobots are appealing
    is their ability to aid surgeons in their training. In addition to that it was
    found that the human collaboration might result in a significant decrease in workplace
    accidents as well as the optimization of production processes in a variety of
    economic industries (Bauer et al., 2008; Kaplan et al., 2016).

    and obtaining visual confirmation on the screen has been one of the most difficult
    issues in producing clinically effective telerobotic surgery. Multiple variables
    influence this latency, including the time necessary to translate video and motions
    into suitable signals and delay in the communication network itself. This work
    proposes an initial secured robotic solution for limited teleoperation tasks in
    a dynamic and unpredictable environment. The study explains the developed control
    architecture, which incorporates expertise from several disciplines such as control
    theory, computer vision and decision-making theory in its modular structure. The
    experiments are run on simulated systems. A rule-based attribute governs all of
    the system's components.

    are just a few of the modern approaches that can help improve healthcare applications
    (Abdelaziz et al., 2018; Ali et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018). Artificial intelligence
    techniques such as machine learning have also aided healthcare specialists' tasks
    by analyzing massive amounts of healthcare data accessible. Data analytics has
    showed the potential to find pattern and hidden aspects in health data, hence
    enhancing healthcare quality through efficient decision-making (Mehta & Pandit,
    2018). The usage of cloud in medical applications gives a way for processing and
    sharing medical reports, as well as delivering new healthcare services with more
    adaptability (Casola et al., 2016). The integration of robot assisted system is
    intended to provide some level of user flexibility while reducing manual interference.
    This unified system employs data mining methods to construct and develop computers
    capable of operating in a medical setting. IoT and robots have been widely used
    for solving a variety of healthcare challenges, ranging from remotely supporting
    physicians during surgery (Akkas et al., 2020; Joseph et al., 2017; Postolache
    et al., 2020).

    duty and making proper procedures better and less expensive than before. The benefit
    of using robots increases accuracy by reducing human error. A constant movement
    of the robot is required in several healthcare applications. In this case, the
    robot must discover an ideal path to the target while avoiding obstacles in congested
    locations. As a result, ensuring effective navigation is the primary focus of
    numerous studies (Hou et al., 2020). This is due to the typical robot's incapacity
    to handle a dynamic environment with stochastic mobility of people. Furthermore,
    due to people's unpredictable mobility, avoiding collisions in robotic environment
    is challenging, especially when operating at confined location. Many researches
    in the study have recently found the subject of robotic system obstacle detection
    (Ahn et al., 2018; Fraga-Lamas et al., 2019). IoT is employed in this case to
    do this without any physical interaction (Safeea et al., 2019). The device employs
    a map-based navigation system that generates a map of its surroundings while simultaneously
    tracking its position. When numerous robots are involved in the healthcare setting,
    it is critical to have an additional way of connectivity among them (Rodriguez-Losada
    et al., 2005). Its purpose is to prevent misinformation in robotic environment
    following the weak Internet access. IoT-enabled robotics serves as a companion
    to the handicapped and elderly who require particular care (Aly & Tapus, 2014).
    Although device to device interface is widely used in robotic systems, the incorporation
    of smart system can improve the efficiency of human-robot interaction. In (Sharif
    & Alsibai, 2017), researcher proposed a “Nao Robot” that can evaluate clinical
    data and communicate with patients. Patients would be able to interpret their
    body's vital indicators and draw assumptions about their health state after interacting
    with the robot. Furthermore, it can estimate the risk of heart disease in the
    future and prescribe lifestyle modifications to reduce medical hazards.

    help a physician at the time of surgery and care for patients. Gesture and posture
    information might be used to operate the robotic arm. Researchers in (Su et al.,
    2020) describe the creation of an Internet of Things-based collaborative control
    technique for robot-assisted microsurgery. The proposed methodology may handle
    multiple jobs in a scheduled manner and also regulating mobility limitations and
    collisions during surgery. Recently, the IoT enabled system has begun to use haptic
    technology (Sreelakshmi & Subash, 2017) to allow surgeons to work on patients
    from an isolated section via the robotic interface (Kim et al., 2018). Furthermore,
    the use of the Network to connect numerous robots and doctors may be impeded by
    network connectivity issues and quality of service (Guntur et al., 2019). This
    can have a significant impact on the precision and success of a surgical treatment.

    of feature, segmentation, and virtual region (Ganapathy et al., 2016; Kanimozhi

    altered the fuzzy membership function, which was utilized to focus the fusion
    over the detection system over fuzzy set. In (Banga et al., 2011) devised a fuzzy
    rule based for providing optimal routing over wireless communication. They have
    increased their network longevity and transmission performance. This is because
    of the application of fuzzy logic and intelligence principles. In (Kumar & Dhiman,
    2021), studies investigate a rule-based approach for predicting relevant information,
    as well as mathematical equations for fuzzy sets, which are used to determine
    the robustness of the system. The researcher in (Chatterjee, 2021) emphasized
    the importance of intellectual patent protection in the artificial intelligence
    field. The model for COVID 19 analytical analysis is described in (Vaishnav et
    al., 2021) utilizing machine learning methodologies. Researchers in (Mule et al.,

    environment, the robot must reason not just about itself but also about its surroundings
    in carryout appropriate actions. In the problem under consideration, the robot
    gets instructions that must cover a variety of scenarios and whose execution is
    affected by a number of context-sensitive decisions. What if, for example, the
    robot is awaiting the next order and an issue arises? Assume the robot is waiting
    for the next user's instruction while performing a restricted function, such as
    situating a tool; it is critical that the robot does not collide with any external
    rigid body due to the fragility or harmfulness of the handled object. As a result,
    the robot should be able to avoid any accidents. If the robot encounters a barrier
    while moving, it will halt and decide its next move.

    smoothly in an environment with dynamic external inflexible bodies. The created
    system solves generic teleoperation problems as well as limited activities. The
    management system, in particular, responds efficiently to external disturbances
    while adhering to the constraints specified. The fundamental benefit of a rule-based
    decision system is its ability to respond quickly to changing situations or failures.
    The entire vision system is capable of obtaining useful information from the field
    in real time, filtering out the robot and quickly notifying the higher level structure
    in the event of a probable incident. The suggested study aims to improve the network's
    efficiency in the medical area. Medical research is heavily focused on reducing
    energy use and improving node lifespan. Due to the dynamic nature of IoT networks,
    the study indicates that energy minimization is a critical issue. However, the
    performance might be enhanced by improving noise reduction or deploying more object
    recognition cameras to provide multiple viewpoints.
