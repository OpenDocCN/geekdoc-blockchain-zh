- en: 'Chapter 2: Blockchain ProgrammingSince the beginning of time, data capturing
    and sharing has always had a human element. There has always been a middleman
    present between you and your information. For example, a retailer is the middleman
    between you and a wholesaler.In that instance, the retailer becomes the central
    authority because your fresh produce is controlled by them. The retailer determines
    how many you can get and at what price. The middlemen have all the power and you
    have to just trust that they are putting your needs first and conducting business
    ethically.If you have ever watched movies online then you have made use of a BitTorrent
    file-sharing protocol. It is a peer-to-peer protocol that allows one to access,
    download and share copies of files that are located on various computers. No single
    computer controls a single file. In that way, the central authority has been totally
    done away with.Blockchain works the same way because it is completely decentralized.
    It completely cuts out the middleman and you aren’t forced to put all your trust
    into one entity.Blockchain Programming Fundamentals●     ConsensusBecause blockchain
    is decentralized, there are millions of nodes all over the world transmitting
    information. Not all nodes are the same though, some are connected to fast computers
    and some may be connected to slow computers. The slower computers will receive
    the data after the faster ones, but there still needs to be one blockchain that
    consists of the same information. Consensus protocols assist all the nodes by
    adjusting the data intermittently to ensure that at the end of the day they all
    have the same information and the blockchain is accurate.●     Hash functionsA
    Hash is a function that takes a lengthy numerical value and compresses it. It
    is then used to identify the data in a specific block on a chain.●     Distributed
    ledger technologyDLT uses cryptography to store information accurately and securely.
    Once the data has been stored, it cannot be changed and it can only be accessed
    through the use of a key or a cryptographic signature.●     Smart contract developmentSmart
    Contracts are programs that run on a blockchain. They are triggered by the terms
    of an agreement between two users. Essentially they are lines of code that state
    the terms of the agreement.●     CryptographyCryptography is taking plain text
    and converting it into code or taking code and converting it into plain text.
    its main function is to keep and share data but only be legible to those it is
    meant for. It is also used to authenticate users that want access to a specific
    network.Best Programming Languages for BlockchainC++C is a programming language
    that uses a procedural programming model and was originally developed to write
    operating systems. Attempting to develop a large-scale application in C proved
    difficult for a lot of programmers because there is no concept of classes and
    objects.In 1985 Bjarne Stroustrap released C++. C++ is an augmented C language.
    It is an Object-Oriented programming language, which means that it combines data
    and functions to make objects. This is helpful when developing apps because the
    code can easily be reused in other programs without having to be rewritten.C++
    took all the good elements of C, like its productivity, pliability and security
    and combined them with its object-oriented approach to create the main language
    for blockchain programming.Here are some reasons why it’s usually a blockchain
    programmer’s first choice:● C++ is one of the most fully fledged programming languages
    out there and it is improved upon regularly. Its functions are optimized because
    of its analytical methods and debuggers.● It has the ability to segregate different
    lines of code and encapsulate them so that they do not collide.● C++ is capable
    of polymorphism. This means it can perform multiple tasks separately. This aids
    in the performance of the digital ledger in its entirety.● It allows for multi-threading.
    Threads are a bunch of instructions that are supposed to be carried out at the
    same time. In blockchain development there will be some tasks that need to run
    concurrently and C++ allows for this.● C++ allows for better memory usage, which
    is essential because there’s a lot of information being passed around in the blockchain
    system.PythonPython is an easy-to-learn programming language. Its structure is
    based on a simple premise: Simplicity, readability, and minimalism. (Farr, 2018).
    It has garnered support from developers old and new because it has a fairly limited
    syntax which makes it easier to read.JavaScriptWhile JavaScript is well-known
    for adding interactivity to websites, it also possesses capabilities that are
    beneficial to blockchain. It can be used to construct an uncomplicated but fortified
    blockchain that can protect against hackers and any other unsavory characters.
    One thing it doesn’t have though, is the SHA256 hash function. SHA stands for
    Secure Hashing Algorithm. Hashing is the process of receiving an input of any
    length and producing an output of fixed length. 256 refers to the length of the
    output. When using the SHA256 function, regardless of the length of the input,
    the output will always be 256 bits long.SolidityThe Ethereum blockchain is superior
    by way of speed and ease of use. This is because it makes use of Solidity. It
    is an object-oriented and effective programming language that is mainly used to
    implement Smart contracts. It is also called the curly bracket language. Solidity
    merges JavaScript’s code and functions along with C++’s classes. This makes it
    the most intricate coding language. Despite that, it is still user friendly and
    there is a lot of information available on how to use it.GOLangGoLang (‘Go’ for
    short) is a programming language that was developed by Google in 2007\. It was
    only released for use by the public in 2012\. On inception, the aim was for it
    to take easy-to-use syntax from JavaScript and combine that with C++’s tried and
    tested security features. GoLang is run inside of an operating system which means
    it is able to handle many parts of a block chain at the same time. Ethereum’s
    Software Development Kit is written in GoLang so there are several blockchain
    apps that use this language.How to Become a Blockchain ProgrammerWith this book,
    you will gain a theoretical knowledge of blockchain technology, its benefits,
    drawbacks and its place in the ever-changing world. But beyond that you need technical
    skills that will allow you to do the practical work.You need to have an understanding
    of some major concepts, like:●     Consensus●     Hash functions●     Distributed
    ledger technologyA data structure is the model you follow to sort and store data
    so that it''s easy to find and amend later. It could also describe a stack of
    data values, how they relate and what functions you can apply to them. There are
    two simple data structures that blockchains combine:●     The linked list data
    structureLinked lists are organized into straight lines. The different components
    are linked with pointers to the first node. The first node is referred to as the
    head and it has two parts. One half of the node contains data and the other half
    makes reference to the next node. They are all structured the same way and always
    have something to refer back to.●     The stackThe stack is also a straight data
    structure. Its principle is; Last in, First out. So the last component in the
    stack is always taken out first. The first pointer is called ‘top.’ It’s how a
    programmer will keep track of the first component in the stack. Once you add another
    component to the stack, the top''s value increases by one and becomes two so that
    it always appears on top.Types of Blockchain DevelopersBlockchain Developers are
    responsible for building and improving upon all Blockchain-related applications.
    They develop Decentralized applications and Smart contracts. They also design
    the architecture and protocols for a blockchain. So developers make secure digital
    transactions possible by generating systems and applications that are able to
    record and store data, while preventing external changes and compromise.Core Blockchain
    DeveloperCore developers are responsible for the architecture of the Blockchain.
    They are in charge of designing the protocols needed to operate a blockchain solution.
    They also design consensus protocols and make big decisions.In order to be an
    effective core developer, you have to have a full understanding of Blockchain
    technology and its architecture. You have to know how hash, DLT and Consensus
    functions work. You also have to have a firm grasp on data structures and coding.These
    are some of their main duties:●     Designing blockchain features that enhance
    functionality●     Designing blockchain and consensus protocols●     Mapping out
    security for the network●     Quality assuranceBlockchain Software DeveloperSoftware
    developers put the architecture designed by core developers into practice. They
    generate decentralized applications in line with blockchain architecture and protocol.
    They deal with the front and back end development of these applications and they
    oversee the stack running the applications.These are some of their main duties:●     Use
    core developer designs to implement smart contracts●     Develop the front and
    backend of decentralized applications● Make sure that the applications are running
    as they should● Make sure that blockchain integrates well with other apps and
    services.'

  zh: 第2章：区块链编程从时间开始，数据捕获和分享一直都有人的元素。在你和你的信息之间总是存在一个中间人。例如，零售商是你和批发商之间的中间人。在这种情况下，零售商成为了中央权威，因为你的新鲜农产品由他们控制。零售商决定你能拿多少，以及以什么价格。中间人拥有所有权力，你只能相信他们首先考虑你的需求，并且以道德方式进行业务。如果你曾经在线观看电影，那么你已经使用了BitTorrent文件共享协议。这是一种点对点协议，允许你访问、下载和分享位于各种计算机上的文件副本。没有单台计算机控制单个文件，因此中央权威已经完全消失了。区块链以相同的方式工作，因为它是完全去中心化的。它完全剔除了中间人，你不必强迫自己对一个实体放心并把所有信任都放在其中。区块链编程基础●
    共识因为区块链是去中心化的，全世界有数百万个节点传输信息。然而，不是所有节点都是一样的，有些连接在快速计算机上，有些连接在慢速计算机上。慢速计算机将在快速计算机之后接收数据，但是仍然需要一个包含相同信息的区块链。共识协议通过调整数据，确保最终他们都拥有相同的信息，并且区块链是准确的。●
    哈希函数哈希是一个将长数字值压缩的函数。然后用于识别链上特定块中的数据。● 分布式分类技术DLT使用密码学准确和安全地存储信息。一旦数据被存储，就不能被改变，只能通过密钥或密码签名来访问。●
    智能合同开发智能合同是在区块链上运行的程序。它们受两个用户之间协议条款的触发。本质上，它们是陈述协议条款的代码行。● 密码学密码学是将明文转换为代码或将代码转换为明文。它的主要功能是保存和分享数据，但只有为其目标所可读。它还用于验证要访问特定网络的用户。区块链的最佳编程语言C++C是一种使用过程式编程模型的编程语言，最初是用于编写操作系统。尝试在C中开发大型应用程序对许多程序员来说都很困难，因为没有类和对象的概念。1985年Bjarne
    Stroustrap发布了C++。C++是增强的C语言。它是一种面向对象的编程语言，这意味着它结合了数据和功能以创建对象。这在开发应用程序时非常有帮助，因为代码可以轻松地在其他程序中重用而不必重新编写。C++采用了C的所有优点，比如其生产率、灵活性和安全性，并将其与面向对象方法相结合，创造了区块链编程的主要语言。以下是它通常是区块链程序员的首选的一些原因：●
    C++是其中功能最完善的编程语言之一，并且它经常得到改进。它的功能经过了优化，因为其分析方法和调试器。● 它有能力分离不同行的代码并封装它们，使它们不会冲突。●
    C++可以实现多态性。这意味着它可以分别执行多个任务。这有助于作为数字分类帐的整体的表现。● 它允许多线程。线程是一堆应该同时运行的指令。在区块链开发中，会有一些需要同时运行的任务，而C++允许这样做。●
    C++允许更好地使用内存，这很重要，因为在区块链系统中有大量的信息传递。PythonPython是一种易于学习的编程语言。它的结构基于一个简单的前提：简单性、可读性和简约性。它得到了老和新开发人员的支持，因为它的语法相对有限，可以更容易阅读。JavaScript尽管JavaScript以添加交互性到网站而闻名，但它也具有对区块链有益的能力。它可以用来构建一个简单但坚固的区块链，以防止黑客和其他不良角色。它唯一缺少的是SHA256哈希函数。SHA代表安全哈希算法。哈希是接收任何长度的输入并产生固定长度输出的过程。256是输出的长度。当使用SHA256函数时，无论输入的长度如何，输出始终为256位长度。Solidity以太坊区块链在速度和易用性方面是优越的。这是因为它使用了Solidity。它是一种面向对象和有效的编程语言，主要用于实现智能合同。它也被称为花括号语言。Solidity结合了JavaScript的代码和函数以及C++的类。这使得它成为了最复杂的编码语言。尽管如此，它仍然用户友好，而且有很多关于如何使用它的信息。GolangGoLang（简称为Go）是由Google于2007年开发的一种编程语言。它在2012年才释放供公众使用。在创立时，它的目标是将JavaScript的易于使用的语法与C++的经过考验的安全功能相结合。GoLang在操作系统内运行，这意味着它能够同时处理区块链的许多部分。以太坊的软件开发工具包是用GoLang编写的，因此有许多区块链应用程序使用这种语言。如何成为区块链程序员通过本书，你将获得区块链技术的理论知识，它的优点、缺点以及它在不断变化的世界中的地位。但除此之外，你需要掌握一些主要概念，比如：●
    共识● 哈希函数● 分布式分类技术数据结构是你遵循的模型，用于对数据进行排序和存储，以便以后方便查找和修改。它也可以描述一堆数据值，它们的关系以及可以应用于它们的函数。区块链结合的有两种简单数据结构：●
    链表数据结构链表被组织成直线。不同的组件通过指向第一个节点的指针链接。第一个节点称为头节点，它有两个部分。一个半节点包含数据，另一半指向下一个节点。它们的结构都是一样的，而且总是有东西可以回指。●
    栈栈也是一种直线数据结构。它的原则是：后进先出。所以栈中的最后一个组件总是首先被取出。第一个指针称为“顶部”。这是程序员跟踪栈中第一个组件的方式。一旦你在栈中添加另一个组件，顶部的值就会增加一，并变成两，所以它总是出现在顶部。区块链开发人员的类型区块链开发人员负责构建和改进所有与区块链相关的应用程序。他们开发去中心化应用程序和智能合同。他们还设计区块链的架构和协议。因此，开发人员通过生成能够记录和存储数据的系统和应用程序，同时防止外部改变和妥协，使安全的数字交易成为可能。核心区块链开发人员核心开发人员负责区块链的架构。他们负责设计运行区块链解决方案所需的协议。他们还设计共识协议并做出重大决定。为了成为一个有效的核心开发人员，你必须充分理解区块链技术及其架构。你必须知道哈希、DLT和共识函数如何工作。你还必须对数据结构和编码有牢固的掌握。这些是他们的一些主要职责：●
    设计增强功能的区块链特性● 设计区块链和共识协议● 绘制网络安全● 质量保证区块链软件开发人员软件开发人员将核心开发人员设计的架构实施到实践中。他们根据区块链架构和协议生成去中心化应用程序。他们处理这些应用程序的前端和后端开发，并监督运行应用程序的堆栈。这些是他们的一些主要职责：●
    使用核心开发人员的设计实现智能合同● 开发去中心化应用程序的前端和后端● 确保应用程序运行正常● 确保区块链与其他应用程序和服务完好无损地集成。
