- en: 'Chapter 2: Blockchain ProgrammingSince the beginning of time, data capturing
    and sharing has always had a human element. There has always been a middleman
    present between you and your information. For example, a retailer is the middleman
    between you and a wholesaler.In that instance, the retailer becomes the central
    authority because your fresh produce is controlled by them. The retailer determines
    how many you can get and at what price. The middlemen have all the power and you
    have to just trust that they are putting your needs first and conducting business
    ethically.If you have ever watched movies online then you have made use of a BitTorrent
    file-sharing protocol. It is a peer-to-peer protocol that allows one to access,
    download and share copies of files that are located on various computers. No single
    computer controls a single file. In that way, the central authority has been totally
    done away with.Blockchain works the same way because it is completely decentralized.
    It completely cuts out the middleman and you aren’t forced to put all your trust
    into one entity.Blockchain Programming Fundamentals●     ConsensusBecause blockchain
    is decentralized, there are millions of nodes all over the world transmitting
    information. Not all nodes are the same though, some are connected to fast computers
    and some may be connected to slow computers. The slower computers will receive
    the data after the faster ones, but there still needs to be one blockchain that
    consists of the same information. Consensus protocols assist all the nodes by
    adjusting the data intermittently to ensure that at the end of the day they all
    have the same information and the blockchain is accurate.●     Hash functionsA
    Hash is a function that takes a lengthy numerical value and compresses it. It
    is then used to identify the data in a specific block on a chain.●     Distributed
    ledger technologyDLT uses cryptography to store information accurately and securely.
    Once the data has been stored, it cannot be changed and it can only be accessed
    through the use of a key or a cryptographic signature.●     Smart contract developmentSmart
    Contracts are programs that run on a blockchain. They are triggered by the terms
    of an agreement between two users. Essentially they are lines of code that state
    the terms of the agreement.●     CryptographyCryptography is taking plain text
    and converting it into code or taking code and converting it into plain text.
    its main function is to keep and share data but only be legible to those it is
    meant for. It is also used to authenticate users that want access to a specific
    network.Best Programming Languages for BlockchainC++C is a programming language
    that uses a procedural programming model and was originally developed to write
    operating systems. Attempting to develop a large-scale application in C proved
    difficult for a lot of programmers because there is no concept of classes and
    objects.In 1985 Bjarne Stroustrap released C++. C++ is an augmented C language.
    It is an Object-Oriented programming language, which means that it combines data
    and functions to make objects. This is helpful when developing apps because the
    code can easily be reused in other programs without having to be rewritten.C++
    took all the good elements of C, like its productivity, pliability and security
    and combined them with its object-oriented approach to create the main language
    for blockchain programming.Here are some reasons why it’s usually a blockchain
    programmer’s first choice:● C++ is one of the most fully fledged programming languages
    out there and it is improved upon regularly. Its functions are optimized because
    of its analytical methods and debuggers.● It has the ability to segregate different
    lines of code and encapsulate them so that they do not collide.● C++ is capable
    of polymorphism. This means it can perform multiple tasks separately. This aids
    in the performance of the digital ledger in its entirety.● It allows for multi-threading.
    Threads are a bunch of instructions that are supposed to be carried out at the
    same time. In blockchain development there will be some tasks that need to run
    concurrently and C++ allows for this.● C++ allows for better memory usage, which
    is essential because there’s a lot of information being passed around in the blockchain
    system.PythonPython is an easy-to-learn programming language. Its structure is
    based on a simple premise: Simplicity, readability, and minimalism. (Farr, 2018).
    It has garnered support from developers old and new because it has a fairly limited
    syntax which makes it easier to read.JavaScriptWhile JavaScript is well-known
    for adding interactivity to websites, it also possesses capabilities that are
    beneficial to blockchain. It can be used to construct an uncomplicated but fortified
    blockchain that can protect against hackers and any other unsavory characters.
    One thing it doesn’t have though, is the SHA256 hash function. SHA stands for
    Secure Hashing Algorithm. Hashing is the process of receiving an input of any
    length and producing an output of fixed length. 256 refers to the length of the
    output. When using the SHA256 function, regardless of the length of the input,
    the output will always be 256 bits long.SolidityThe Ethereum blockchain is superior
    by way of speed and ease of use. This is because it makes use of Solidity. It
    is an object-oriented and effective programming language that is mainly used to
    implement Smart contracts. It is also called the curly bracket language. Solidity
    merges JavaScript’s code and functions along with C++’s classes. This makes it
    the most intricate coding language. Despite that, it is still user friendly and
    there is a lot of information available on how to use it.GOLangGoLang (‘Go’ for
    short) is a programming language that was developed by Google in 2007\. It was
    only released for use by the public in 2012\. On inception, the aim was for it
    to take easy-to-use syntax from JavaScript and combine that with C++’s tried and
    tested security features. GoLang is run inside of an operating system which means
    it is able to handle many parts of a block chain at the same time. Ethereum’s
    Software Development Kit is written in GoLang so there are several blockchain
    apps that use this language.How to Become a Blockchain ProgrammerWith this book,
    you will gain a theoretical knowledge of blockchain technology, its benefits,
    drawbacks and its place in the ever-changing world. But beyond that you need technical
    skills that will allow you to do the practical work.You need to have an understanding
    of some major concepts, like:●     Consensus●     Hash functions●     Distributed
    ledger technologyA data structure is the model you follow to sort and store data
    so that it''s easy to find and amend later. It could also describe a stack of
    data values, how they relate and what functions you can apply to them. There are
    two simple data structures that blockchains combine:●     The linked list data
    structureLinked lists are organized into straight lines. The different components
    are linked with pointers to the first node. The first node is referred to as the
    head and it has two parts. One half of the node contains data and the other half
    makes reference to the next node. They are all structured the same way and always
    have something to refer back to.●     The stackThe stack is also a straight data
    structure. Its principle is; Last in, First out. So the last component in the
    stack is always taken out first. The first pointer is called ‘top.’ It’s how a
    programmer will keep track of the first component in the stack. Once you add another
    component to the stack, the top''s value increases by one and becomes two so that
    it always appears on top.Types of Blockchain DevelopersBlockchain Developers are
    responsible for building and improving upon all Blockchain-related applications.
    They develop Decentralized applications and Smart contracts. They also design
    the architecture and protocols for a blockchain. So developers make secure digital
    transactions possible by generating systems and applications that are able to
    record and store data, while preventing external changes and compromise.Core Blockchain
    DeveloperCore developers are responsible for the architecture of the Blockchain.
    They are in charge of designing the protocols needed to operate a blockchain solution.
    They also design consensus protocols and make big decisions.In order to be an
    effective core developer, you have to have a full understanding of Blockchain
    technology and its architecture. You have to know how hash, DLT and Consensus
    functions work. You also have to have a firm grasp on data structures and coding.These
    are some of their main duties:●     Designing blockchain features that enhance
    functionality●     Designing blockchain and consensus protocols●     Mapping out
    security for the network●     Quality assuranceBlockchain Software DeveloperSoftware
    developers put the architecture designed by core developers into practice. They
    generate decentralized applications in line with blockchain architecture and protocol.
    They deal with the front and back end development of these applications and they
    oversee the stack running the applications.These are some of their main duties:●     Use
    core developer designs to implement smart contracts●     Develop the front and
    backend of decentralized applications● Make sure that the applications are running
    as they should● Make sure that blockchain integrates well with other apps and
    services.'
