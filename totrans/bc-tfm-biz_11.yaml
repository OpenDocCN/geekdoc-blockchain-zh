    technology and it will have a massive impact on how we live, work, and build our
    societies. Distributed ledgers facilitate trustless peer-to-peer transactions,
    removing the need for intermediaries and making data immutable, verifiable, and
    traceable. It has been said that blockchain will do for transactions what the
    advent of the internet did for the sharing of information. Leaders, organisations,
    and societies that want to innovate and lead the pack should be aware of Blockchain
    and how it will change—well everything. In writing this book, it was our objective
    to offer you some insights into how Blockchain could be used to create a better
    world and not just focus on the commercial benefits of Blockchain. Of course,
    Distributed Ledger Technology provides ample opportunities for organisations to
    create better products and services, reduce their costs, and improve their bottom
    line significantly. However, as may be clear by now, the technology can also be
    used for the social good and create a better, fairer, and more equal world. Of
    course, if you look at the statistics as discussed in [Chapter 4](ch0004.xlink.xhtml),
    you can argue that we have never had it better, but that does not mean that we
    can sit back and relax. Climate change is a severe threat to humanity, over 700
    million people still live in extreme poverty [147], corruption, fraud, money laundering
    activities, and censorship continue to take place on a wide scale across the globe,
    and Fair Trade often is not really fair at all. In addition, our current identity
    system is long overdue for a replacement, which in itself would help solve many
    of the Wicked Problems discussed in this book.

    the world experiences an accelerated change and many disruptive technologies are
    coming to fruition. Big data analytics, artificial intelligence, the Internet
    of Things, Virtual and Augmented Reality, 3D printing, robotics, and quantum computing
    are just a few of the technologies that will increasingly have an impact on our
    lives. When these technologies converge, a radical shift, or a ‘gestalt shift’,
    will occur, which means that the character of the experience will drastically
    change. All of a sudden, we can see the world through a different, more technologically
    advanced, lens and this opens up a completely new perspective. The convergence
    of multiple disruptive technologies will offer us new possibilities and solutions
    to improve our lives and create better organisations and societies, as well as
    build a better world all together. Let’s briefly discuss three of them, which
    we believe are also key to solving the Wicked Problems that have been discussed.
    We do not go into too much depth, because there are plenty of other books that
    cover these topics in great detail.

    and usage of data in high velocity, volume, variety, and variability. In recent
    years, we have been generating large amounts of data, which is expected to grow
    exponentially in the coming years [341]. Big data changes organisations, and their
    culture and identity, as well as decision-making [342, 343]. For many organisations,
    the most likely path to competitive advantage is via big data analytics [344].
    Hence, it is not only start-ups such as Uber or AirBnB that can profit from a
    data-driven approach [345]—any company has become a data business where big data
    analytics is now a prerequisite to understand the environment and remain competitive.
    Big data analytics offers organisations competitive advantage and can help not-for-profit
    organisations and governments create better products and services.

    and it is similar to looking into the rear-view mirror of your car—using a variety
    of structured datasets and statistical methods to achieve insights about what
    has happened from a second ago to decades ago. Predictive analytics improves decision-making
    across an organisation [346], in order to understand how to respond to the changing
    environment. It is your car’s navigation system that tells you the fastest route
    despite a traffic jam. [345a] Predictive analytics uses artificial intelligence
    to find patterns and relationships in multiple (un)structured data sources to
    create recommendations [347]. Organisations that use predictive analytics gain
    a competitive advantage, because they can anticipate the future [348]. Finally,
    prescriptive analytics transforms an organisation and is the final stage in understanding
    a business. It allows a permanent and real-time (re)alignment of (in)tangible
    assets based on recommendations obtained from analysing unstructured and structured
    data sources. It uses a variety of algorithms and data-modelling techniques to
    offer recommendations on how to take advantage of predictions provided. Continuing
    with the car metaphor, it is like a self-driving car bringing you autonomously
    to your destination. [345a]

    a shift in the power structure within the business; decision-making power moves
    from those leaders with the most experience to anyone who has access to data and
    the analytic tools to derive insights from it. In a data-driven business, the
    real decision-makers within an organisation are not senior managers or C-level
    executives, but those employees who face the customer or are directly involved
    in creating the product or service. Some leaders might be reluctant to accept
    this shift in power, but, only when all leaders accept such a power shift, can
    the organisation truly benefit from big data analytics. Empowered employees are
    more likely to collaborate with different stakeholders to create the best result
    for the business, because they feel more involved and more responsible for the
    success of the organisation. In this way, those organisations that want to remain
    competitive in a constantly changing and increasingly data-driven world should
    foster employee collaboration and promote the use of (advanced) analytics across
    the business, and network organisations in particular are in the right position
    to do so. However, big data analytics does not only offer benefits for commercial
    organisations. In fact, big data analytics is a key aspect of solving the Wicked
    Problems discussed in this book.

    has become a data business that happens to make product X or Y. The same goes
    for any not-for-profit or government institution—all have become data organisations
    that happen to offer service X or Y. For example, a car company is a data company
    that helps people move from A to B, whereas a bank is a data company that happens
    to help customers with their financial needs. Viewing your organisation from this
    new perspective will enable you to find new solutions, develop better products,
    and offer improved services. The same goes for the Wicked Problems discussed in
    this book. If we see them as a data problem, it will become a little bit easier
    to solve them.

    launched the Global Pulse initiative, which serves as an innovation lab to raise
    awareness of the opportunities that big data brings. The objective is to be a
    catalyst for big data adoption and bring together different stakeholders, such
    as big data scientists, data providers, governments, and development sector practitioners
    [269]. Climate change is one of the areas that can benefit from big data analytics
    by monitoring processes that previously could not be monitored. The UN’s Global
    Pulse data analytics initiative launched the Big Data Climate Challenge in 2014\.
    This programme funded, among others, programmes to monitor deforestation by combining
    satellite data, crowd-sourced witness accounts, and public data. These insights
    help policy-makers and organisations, such as Nestlé or Unilever, ensure that
    their activities do not worsen deforestation [349, 350]. On the other hand, poverty
    can be reduced by providing the right medicines to the right people at the right
    moment [351], as we have already shown in the fictional business in [Chapter 4](ch0004.xlink.xhtml).
    A programme called SMS for Life significantly improved the distribution of malaria
    drugs in Tanzania, by predicting demand more accurately [352]. A big data study
    by the World Bank revealed that, in many countries, people are not literally starving
    of hunger, because they have enough food, but that they are dying because the
    food was not nutritious enough. As a result, governments could change their aid
    by focusing on more nutritious food rather than subsidising rice or noodles [353].
    Fraud, corruption, or money laundering, in any industry, can also of course be
    reduced using big data analytics. With an estimated US$3.5 trillion in revenue
    lost every year due to fraudulent activities [354], there is a huge incentive
    for organisations to look into the details. Pattern recognition and anomaly detection
    will offer insights into cases that are out of the ordinary and require additional
    attention. The more such analytics can be automated using artificial intelligence,
    the better we will be able to find solutions to the Wicked Problems. It is for
    these reasons that the advances in artificial intelligence are so promising.

    developed by Google’s DeepMind, was released. Although previous versions of AlphaGo
    had been trained using human data, this version of the algorithm is completely
    self-trained, with no human intervention or historical data. This is a mind-blowing
    feature, especially given that, within three days of teaching itself how to play
    the game, it beat the version that beat Lee Sedol in 2016\. It did so using a
    new form of reinforcement learning where the algorithm became its own teacher.
    It played against itself, which meant that it always had a component of equal
    strength, and learned from every move it made. Although the previous version that
    beat Lee Sedol already surprised the world champion with moves he had never seen
    or thought about, the new version applies completely unknown strategies that it
    had taught itself. As a result, after 40 days it surpassed all previous versions
    of AlphaGo and, arguably, became the best AlphaGo player in the world. This was
    a significant event in the world of artificial intelligence, because it represented
    a new form of artificial intelligence—intuitive artificial intelligence, something
    that is remarkably more challenging than standard artificial intelligence.

    The largest taxi company in the world, Uber, owns no taxis, but uses smart algorithms
    to connect drivers and passengers. The largest telephone company in the world,
    WhatsApp, has no telecom infrastructure, but sends over 35 billion messages per
    day. Finally, the world’s second most valuable retailer, Alibaba, owns no inventory
    but uses algorithms to help others sell products. Companies such as Uber, WhatsApp,
    and Alibaba clearly show that artificial intelligence can disrupt an entire industry
    [345]. However, we are just at the start of this disruption and the coming decade
    will probably see all industries being disrupted thanks to artificial intelligence.

    and more data. Some organisations, such as Walmart, create and store dozens of
    petabytes of data every day [357]. Collecting and storing massive amounts of data
    is not, however, enough to solve some of the Wicked Problems. For this to happen,
    organisations must do more than simply analyse the data. It is about what actions
    you can derive from your data in order to add value. Algorithms define actions
    and they are pieces of software that are extremely good at very specific actions,
    much better than humans are. As a result, the more algorithms used within organisations,
    the more people will be out of a job in the future. In fact, 2013 research from
    Oxford University and Deloitte estimated that in the UK alone, more than 35% of
    current jobs are at high risk due to computerisation [358]. And the UK is not
    alone. The same research estimated that almost 47% of US jobs could be lost due
    to algorithmic business within one or two decades. A society with almost half
    the workforce without a job does sound frightening and is another Wicked Problem
    to be dealt with. However, if we prepare ourselves today it also offers great
    possibilities to drastically improve our societies.

    but business-related stories, such as quarterly earnings, involving stock market
    performance and corporate profits—stories, however, these used to be written by
    humans. Does this mean robot journalists are putting journalists out of business?
    No, at least not yet, although the developments in artificial intelligence that
    can write a readable novel are progressing rapidly. Also worth mentioning is Lapetus,

    to massive datasets, millions of videos/images/articles, etc. and the algorithms
    must figure out for themselves how to recognise different objects, sentences,
    images, etc. As a result, they can come up with solutions no humans could have
    thought of, so without big data this would not have been possible. For example,
    in 2016 a set of algorithms developed an encryption algorithm that humans could
    not decipher, because it was using patterns humans would never use [359]. Naturally,
    artificial intelligence is particularly well suited to solving Wicked Problems,
    because they can easily process large amounts of data and confusing information,
    link it back to any stakeholders involved, and propose solutions that could point
    us in the right direction. The more intelligent artificial intelligence becomes,
    the more useful it becomes in solving our Wicked Problems. In fact, already artificial
    intelligence can no longer be ignored when trying to solve Wicked Problems. For
    every Wicked Problem discussed in this book, it is vital to have vast amounts
    of data, and artificial intelligence can then be used to recognise patterns, discover
    (inter)dependencies, understand differences and similarities, classify data automatically,
    make predictions, and take action accordingly. Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind,
    the division within Google responsible for AlphaGo and doing ground-breaking research
    on artificial intelligence, said ‘the goal is to harness artificial intelligence
    for grand challenges. If we can solve intelligence in a general enough way, then
    we can apply it to all sorts of things to make the world a better place’ [360].
    The more data available to artificial intelligence, the better it will become,
    because deep learning feeds on big data. This is why the Internet of Things is
    so important, because it has the potential to increase the amount of data exponentially.

    to believe, were immune to automation are also being affected by artificial intelligence.
    There are already restaurants without staff, where the burgers are made by a robot
    or the sushi is delivered by a robot. The company Momentum Machines, for example,
    has made a robot that produces burgers, which replaces two or three fast food
    cooks. As Momentum Machines cofounder Alexandros Vardakostas said in 2012: ‘our
    device isn’t meant to make employees more efficient, it’s meant to completely
    obviate them.’ However, the redundancy does not stop there—the more complicated
    jobs such as accountants, truck drivers, or customer service agents will be taken
    over by algorithms and robots. If you believe that software development would

    in the first place. In 2017, they unveiled a new approach using neural networks

    that are more powerful, more efficient, and better to use than what developers
    can build. The more advanced artificial intelligence becomes in the next decade,
    the more jobs will disappear as a result. Therefore, a future in which robots

    energy firm RWE, fintech start-up GovCoin, and University College London to send
    welfare payments using the blockchain and record any payments sent or received
    by welfare recipients [362]. Finland takes it to the next level—they are the first
    country in the world to have started a large experiment with an unconditional
    basic income for a group of 2000 unemployed Finns, aged 25–58 years, in order
    to prepare for a jobless future. According to several Finnish experts, the blockchain
    technology offers significant benefits for an unconditional basic income scheme,
    including transparency, while ensuring privacy, automating government tasks, reducing
    any bureaucracies, and as such significantly reducing costs associated with government
    services [363]. An unconditional basic income is one solution to solving the issue
    of a jobless future and it will enable humans to focus on other aspects of life
    such as creativity and self-actualisation. Of course, a basic income for all citizens
    does not come cheap, so governments should streamline any tax systems currently
    in place, remove any social and tax benefits, and therefore opt for a simplified
    tax system. Blockchain would enable this, especially when a country uses an existing,
    or its own future, cryptocurrency such as the crypto-dollar, crypto-euro or crypto-yuan.

    is and what its different components are. At its core, Blockchain is nothing more
    than a database technology, but the implications of the technology are transformative
    and can be far reaching. Therefore, it is crucial that the organisation has a
    shared understanding of what Blockchain is and what it can do for your organisation
    or industry. As the wide range of Blockchain start-ups discussed in this book
    shows, Blockchain can be applied to any industry and any business objective. For
    each industry, Blockchain offers different opportunities, ranging from data or
    product provenance, improved identity, and verification systems, to increased
    payment efficiencies. Therefore, creating a shared understanding, at the board
    level, of what Blockchain can do for your business is a vital first step.

    win management support and buy in from the rest of the organisation. With the
    enormous potential of Blockchain, it is more a strategy matter than an IT one.
    This is particularly because, if you wish to take Blockchain seriously, it will
    take time and in the beginning the return on investments may be unclear and could
    even be negative. Possession of a shared understanding of the decentralised future
    of your business will help in achieving your long-term vision.

    Many problems can be solved with a database or even a spreadsheet. As blockchain
    technology is a financial investment, it is crucial to establish that it is the
    best solution for the problem at hand.

    problems that lend themselves to a blockchain-based solution. These include: roadblocks
    in supply chain and trade facilitation, where multiple parties need access to
    common data while needing to protect their commercial interests; protection of
    markets that rely on provenance; registration of title and rights; recording permissions
    for the use of digital assets and creative works; preservation of digital works
    in perpetuity; and recording transactions where it is important to make those
    transactions transparent to a network. Blockchain offers neutral territory for
    sharing information across organisational boundaries. In addition to these business
    service examples, blockchain technology can facilitate sharing information about
    trends, voting patterns, data analysis, and record keeping.'

    is not private or confidential. In a world of heightened data and privacy protection,
    this issue must be borne in mind before advertising information to participants
    on a public or permissioned network.

    contracts. Blockchain should be a means to an end, not the other way around. When
    deciding to require a token, understand clearly why you need a token and what
    sort of token, because there are plenty of decentralised solutions that do not
    require one.

- en: As is with any new technology that you wish to implement within your organisation,
    it is wise to start small and develop a minimum viable product (MVP). The best
    way to learn a new, disruptive technology is to start small and grow from there,
    and slowly implement it throughout the organisation. In addition, Blockchain differs
    from any other emerging technology because it often requires organisations to
    collaborate with industry partners, customers, or even competitors as, only through
    decentralised collaboration with your stakeholders, do the benefits of Blockchain
    become truly visible. Whether the product needs to serve a vertical organisational
    structure or a horizontal supply chain scenario (or both), all participants need
    to understand why certain information is being shared and to trust that personal,
    commercial-in-confidence, and industry-sensitive information is secure. Blockchain’s
    transparency can make all of these functions explicit (as outputs or nullities).

    time of publication, the adoption journey of this new technology has travelled
    to the same point that the internet had reached in 1994 or 1995\. Obviously, it
    will not take another 20 years for this new ecosystem to develop fully, but many
    of the technologies required for your decentralised organisation are still in
    their beta or even alpha stage of testing. This is why developing an MVP with
    your stakeholders is the best way to get started and ensure that the technology
    works as it should, before further expansion into your organisation.

    and technical architects, solidity developers, and cryptographers, but also data
    scientists, mathematicians, and security specialists. If you also want to do an
    Initial Coin Offering (ICO) at some stage, you also require ICO specialists, a
    new type of job that is rapidly becoming more important. Unfortunately, the market
    for Blockchain developers (a general term to include all of the above) is still
    very small, simply because the technology is still so new. Hence, it is important
    for your organisation to start hiring (or partnering with) the right Blockchain
    developers as soon as possible. Make sure that they have the right industry experience
    because Blockchain technology does differ per industry.

    organisations to implement blockchain solutions. These include traditional consultancy
    firms such as Accenture, IBM, KPMG or Microsoft, or you can turn to new more specialised
    firms such as Consensys or Chainsmiths.

    and an MVP, and lined up new resources, it is time to start expanding your efforts.
    With luck, your steps into the world of Blockchain result in tangible improvements
    to your business and your bottom line, which you can then use to start focusing
    on the impact of Blockchain on your core business. The MVP that you develop will
    help you create a long-term Blockchain strategy and roadmap, including your intended
    objectives such as increased efficiencies, reduced risks, better governance, or
    quality improvements.

    whether it will stay on the periphery of your organisation, only slightly affecting
    your business, or moves into the mainstream of your business, thereby radically
    changing your business. Whichever it is, by investing in one or more MVPs, you
    are prepared for the future ahead, because you have learned the capabilities needed
    to develop a decentralised business. This, in itself, it very valuable and will
    help you gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly decentralised society.

    returning the web to its decentralised and distributed nature. Today, the three
    biggest online companies, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, have enormous power, which
    they apply to increase shareholder return using their customers’ data. As Jonathan
    Taplin revealed in his 2017 book Move Fast and Break Things, this ‘surveillance
    capital’ actually increases inequality, does very little for the social good,
    and can actually be very bad for democracy [364]. It is time for change and to
    apply emerging technologies to improve our world rather than just increasing shareholders’
    returns. Of course, this does not mean that you cannot make money. In fact, the
    drive to make a good profit offers tremendous opportunities. The few billion people
    who are currently excluded are a great target market, if done in a fair and honest
    way. As we wrote in [Chapter 6](ch0006.xlink.xhtml), reducing climate change is
    a good business opportunity that can make millions while improving our world.

    effort of individuals, organisations, and governments. Governments should start
    applying Blockchain to improve government services, making it easier to do business
    and comply with the law. Blockchain offers so many opportunities for governments
    to reduce bureaucracy, remove inefficiencies, and help organisations do what they
    can do best: run a business and, hopefully, create a better world. On the other
    hand, organisations can apply Blockchain, as well as other emerging technologies,
    to develop better products and services, create a better customer experience,
    and return control of personal data to the customer. The immutability, verifiability,
    and traceability of data on a blockchain will result in more transparency and
    security, and bring a new level of privacy, currently lost in many countries.
    Finally, individuals will be able to directly transact with their peers, across
    time and space, in a secure manner. It will foster collaboration on a global scale
    unseen before, enabling individuals to help each other and make money along the
    way in new and innovative ways. Cryptography and encryption will ensure that individuals
    can trust each other without knowing each other, opening up new connections and
    trade across the globe.'

    Problems. Offering every citizen a digital and secure self-sovereign identity
    enables them to interact with other individuals, organisations, and governments
    in a secure, transparent and private manner. This would require governments to
    embrace blockchain and other emerging technologies, similar to the Estonian model,
    and create a digital-first strategy. Governments should no longer focus only on
    attracting companies with tax benefits, but also on those with efficiency benefits.
    Governments should remove any bureaucratic inefficiencies for organisations and
    individuals. After all, a government is a data organisation as well, which happens
    to enable a free, safe, equal, prosperous, clean environment in their citizens’
    best interests. Once self-sovereign identities are commonplace, it will become
    a lot easier to solve the other Wicked Problems and create a fair, transparent,
    and secure world for all. Of course, this does not mean that solving the other
    Wicked Problems can wait until we have a self-sovereign identity system in place.
    Existing organisations and start-ups, as well as governments and individuals,
    should embrace Blockchain technologies today to create a better world for tomorrow,
    by reducing climate change, ending poverty/corruption/fraud/money laundering and
    improving our democracies and Fair Trade. The technology is here and there is
    not a moment to lose.
