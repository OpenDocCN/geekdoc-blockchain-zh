- en: We live in exponential times. As might be clear by now, Blockchain is a disruptive
    technology and it will have a massive impact on how we live, work, and build our
    societies. Distributed ledgers facilitate trustless peer-to-peer transactions,
    removing the need for intermediaries and making data immutable, verifiable, and
    traceable. It has been said that blockchain will do for transactions what the
    advent of the internet did for the sharing of information. Leaders, organisations,
    and societies that want to innovate and lead the pack should be aware of Blockchain
    and how it will change—well everything. In writing this book, it was our objective
    to offer you some insights into how Blockchain could be used to create a better
    world and not just focus on the commercial benefits of Blockchain. Of course,
    Distributed Ledger Technology provides ample opportunities for organisations to
    create better products and services, reduce their costs, and improve their bottom
    line significantly. However, as may be clear by now, the technology can also be
    used for the social good and create a better, fairer, and more equal world. Of
    course, if you look at the statistics as discussed in [Chapter 4](ch0004.xlink.xhtml),
    you can argue that we have never had it better, but that does not mean that we
    can sit back and relax. Climate change is a severe threat to humanity, over 700
    million people still live in extreme poverty [147], corruption, fraud, money laundering
    activities, and censorship continue to take place on a wide scale across the globe,
    and Fair Trade often is not really fair at all. In addition, our current identity
    system is long overdue for a replacement, which in itself would help solve many
    of the Wicked Problems discussed in this book.

    years, we have been generating large amounts of data, which is expected to grow
    exponentially in the coming years [341]. Big data changes organisations, and their

    the most likely path to competitive advantage is via big data analytics [344].
    Hence, it is not only start-ups such as Uber or AirBnB that can profit from a
    data-driven approach [345]—any company has become a data business where big data
    analytics is now a prerequisite to understand the environment and remain competitive.

    across an organisation [346], in order to understand how to respond to the changing
    environment. It is your car’s navigation system that tells you the fastest route
    despite a traffic jam. [345a] Predictive analytics uses artificial intelligence
    to find patterns and relationships in multiple (un)structured data sources to
    create recommendations [347]. Organisations that use predictive analytics gain
    a competitive advantage, because they can anticipate the future [348]. Finally,
    prescriptive analytics transforms an organisation and is the final stage in understanding
    a business. It allows a permanent and real-time (re)alignment of (in)tangible
    assets based on recommendations obtained from analysing unstructured and structured
    data sources. It uses a variety of algorithms and data-modelling techniques to

    a shift in the power structure within the business; decision-making power moves
    from those leaders with the most experience to anyone who has access to data and
    the analytic tools to derive insights from it. In a data-driven business, the
    real decision-makers within an organisation are not senior managers or C-level
    executives, but those employees who face the customer or are directly involved
    in creating the product or service. Some leaders might be reluctant to accept
    this shift in power, but, only when all leaders accept such a power shift, can
    the organisation truly benefit from big data analytics. Empowered employees are
    more likely to collaborate with different stakeholders to create the best result
    for the business, because they feel more involved and more responsible for the
    success of the organisation. In this way, those organisations that want to remain
    competitive in a constantly changing and increasingly data-driven world should
    foster employee collaboration and promote the use of (advanced) analytics across
    the business, and network organisations in particular are in the right position

- en: The United Nations also saw the potential of big data analytics. In 2009, they
    launched the Global Pulse initiative, which serves as an innovation lab to raise
    awareness of the opportunities that big data brings. The objective is to be a
    catalyst for big data adoption and bring together different stakeholders, such
    as big data scientists, data providers, governments, and development sector practitioners
    [269]. Climate change is one of the areas that can benefit from big data analytics
    by monitoring processes that previously could not be monitored. The UN’s Global
    Pulse data analytics initiative launched the Big Data Climate Challenge in 2014\.
    This programme funded, among others, programmes to monitor deforestation by combining
    satellite data, crowd-sourced witness accounts, and public data. These insights
    help policy-makers and organisations, such as Nestlé or Unilever, ensure that
    their activities do not worsen deforestation [349, 350]. On the other hand, poverty
    can be reduced by providing the right medicines to the right people at the right
    moment [351], as we have already shown in the fictional business in [Chapter 4](ch0004.xlink.xhtml).
    A programme called SMS for Life significantly improved the distribution of malaria
    drugs in Tanzania, by predicting demand more accurately [352]. A big data study
    by the World Bank revealed that, in many countries, people are not literally starving
    of hunger, because they have enough food, but that they are dying because the
    food was not nutritious enough. As a result, governments could change their aid
    by focusing on more nutritious food rather than subsidising rice or noodles [353].
    Fraud, corruption, or money laundering, in any industry, can also of course be
    reduced using big data analytics. With an estimated US$3.5 trillion in revenue
    lost every year due to fraudulent activities [354], there is a huge incentive
    for organisations to look into the details. Pattern recognition and anomaly detection
    will offer insights into cases that are out of the ordinary and require additional
    attention. The more such analytics can be automated using artificial intelligence,
    the better we will be able to find solutions to the Wicked Problems. It is for
    these reasons that the advances in artificial intelligence are so promising.

    Data Climate Challenge）。这个项目资助了包括监测森林砍伐在内的其他项目，这些项目通过结合卫星数据、众包的目击证人和公共数据来监测森林砍伐。这些洞察帮助政策制定者和组织，如雀巢（Nestlé）或联合利华（Unilever），确保他们的活动不会加剧森林砍伐[349,

    Life”的计划通过更准确地预测需求，显著改善了坦桑尼亚的疟疾药物分配[352]。世界银行的一项大数据研究发现，在许多国家，人们并不是真的因为饥饿而饿死，因为他们有足够的食物，而是因为他们吃的东西营养不够。因此，政府可以通过关注更有营养的食物而不是补贴大米或面条来改变他们的援助方式[353]。在任何行业中，欺诈、腐败或洗钱都可以当然地通过大数据分析来减少。由于欺诈活动每年造成的估计收入损失高达3.5万亿美元[354]，组织有很大的动力去深入了解细节。模式识别和异常检测将提供关于异常案例的见解，这些案例需要额外关注。通过人工智能自动化这些分析，我们就能更好地找到解决“棘手问题”的解决方案。正是出于这些原因，人工智能的进步是如此有希望。

    must figure out for themselves how to recognise different objects, sentences,
    images, etc. As a result, they can come up with solutions no humans could have
    thought of, so without big data this would not have been possible. For example,
    in 2016 a set of algorithms developed an encryption algorithm that humans could
    not decipher, because it was using patterns humans would never use [359]. Naturally,
    artificial intelligence is particularly well suited to solving Wicked Problems,
    because they can easily process large amounts of data and confusing information,
    link it back to any stakeholders involved, and propose solutions that could point
    us in the right direction. The more intelligent artificial intelligence becomes,
    the more useful it becomes in solving our Wicked Problems. In fact, already artificial
    intelligence can no longer be ignored when trying to solve Wicked Problems. For
    every Wicked Problem discussed in this book, it is vital to have vast amounts
    of data, and artificial intelligence can then be used to recognise patterns, discover
    (inter)dependencies, understand differences and similarities, classify data automatically,
    make predictions, and take action accordingly. Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind,
    the division within Google responsible for AlphaGo and doing ground-breaking research
    on artificial intelligence, said ‘the goal is to harness artificial intelligence
    for grand challenges. If we can solve intelligence in a general enough way, then
    we can apply it to all sorts of things to make the world a better place’ [360].
    The more data available to artificial intelligence, the better it will become,

    There are already restaurants without staff, where the burgers are made by a robot

    basic income for a group of 2000 unemployed Finns, aged 25–58 years, in order
    to prepare for a jobless future. According to several Finnish experts, the blockchain
    technology offers significant benefits for an unconditional basic income scheme,
    including transparency, while ensuring privacy, automating government tasks, reducing
    any bureaucracies, and as such significantly reducing costs associated with government
    services [363]. An unconditional basic income is one solution to solving the issue
    of a jobless future and it will enable humans to focus on other aspects of life
    such as creativity and self-actualisation. Of course, a basic income for all citizens
    does not come cheap, so governments should streamline any tax systems currently
    in place, remove any social and tax benefits, and therefore opt for a simplified
    tax system. Blockchain would enable this, especially when a country uses an existing,
    or its own future, cryptocurrency such as the crypto-dollar, crypto-euro or crypto-yuan.

  zh: 第四步：开始招聘新人才
- en: Blockchain technology requires new specialists, including developers, business
    and technical architects, solidity developers, and cryptographers, but also data
    scientists, mathematicians, and security specialists. If you also want to do an
    Initial Coin Offering (ICO) at some stage, you also require ICO specialists, a
    new type of job that is rapidly becoming more important. Unfortunately, the market
    for Blockchain developers (a general term to include all of the above) is still
    very small, simply because the technology is still so new. Hence, it is important
    for your organisation to start hiring (or partnering with) the right Blockchain
    developers as soon as possible. Make sure that they have the right industry experience
    because Blockchain technology does differ per industry.

  zh: 区块链技术需要新的专家，包括开发者、商务和技术架构师、Solidity开发者以及密码学家，但同时也需要数据科学家、数学家和安全专家。如果您在某个阶段还想进行首次币发行（ICO），那么您还需要ICO专家，这是一种正在变得越来越重要的新工作类型。不幸的是，区块链开发者（一个包括上述所有内容的泛称）的市场仍然非常小，原因很简单，这项技术仍然非常新颖。因此，您的组织尽快开始招聘（或与合作伙伴）正确的区块链开发者非常重要。确保他们有正确的行业经验，因为区块链技术根据不同行业而有所不同。

    and an MVP, and lined up new resources, it is time to start expanding your efforts.
    With luck, your steps into the world of Blockchain result in tangible improvements
    to your business and your bottom line, which you can then use to start focusing
    on the impact of Blockchain on your core business. The MVP that you develop will
    help you create a long-term Blockchain strategy and roadmap, including your intended
    objectives such as increased efficiencies, reduced risks, better governance, or
    quality improvements.

    whether it will stay on the periphery of your organisation, only slightly affecting
    your business, or moves into the mainstream of your business, thereby radically
    changing your business. Whichever it is, by investing in one or more MVPs, you
    are prepared for the future ahead, because you have learned the capabilities needed
    to develop a decentralised business. This, in itself, it very valuable and will
    help you gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly decentralised society.

- en: The future is distributed and decentralised, and in the coming decade we are
    returning the web to its decentralised and distributed nature. Today, the three
    biggest online companies, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, have enormous power, which
    they apply to increase shareholder return using their customers’ data. As Jonathan
    Taplin revealed in his 2017 book Move Fast and Break Things, this ‘surveillance
    capital’ actually increases inequality, does very little for the social good,
    and can actually be very bad for democracy [364]. It is time for change and to
    apply emerging technologies to improve our world rather than just increasing shareholders’
    returns. Of course, this does not mean that you cannot make money. In fact, the
    drive to make a good profit offers tremendous opportunities. The few billion people
    who are currently excluded are a great target market, if done in a fair and honest
    way. As we wrote in [Chapter 6](ch0006.xlink.xhtml), reducing climate change is
    a good business opportunity that can make millions while improving our world.

  zh: 未来是分布式和去中心化的，在接下来的十年里，我们正在将网络归还给它去中心化和分布式本质。如今，谷歌（Google）、脸书（Facebook）和亚马逊（Amazon）这三家最大的在线公司拥有巨大的权力，它们利用这些权力通过用户数据提高股东回报。乔纳森·塔普林（Jonathan
    Taplin）在2017年的书《Move Fast and Break Things》中透露，这种“监控资本”实际上加剧了不平等，对社会的好处寥寥无几，实际上对民主可能非常不利[364]。是时候进行变革，利用新兴技术改善我们的世界，而不仅仅是提高股东回报。当然，这并不意味着你不能赚钱。实际上，追求可观的利润提供了巨大的机会。目前被排除在外的数十亿人是一个巨大的目标市场，只要以公平和诚实的方式去做。正如我们在[第6章](ch0006.xlink.xhtml)所写，减少气候变化是一个既能赚钱又能改善我们世界的绝佳商业机会。
- en: 'Solving the Wicked Problems discussed in this book requires a collaborative
    effort of individuals, organisations, and governments. Governments should start
    applying Blockchain to improve government services, making it easier to do business
    and comply with the law. Blockchain offers so many opportunities for governments
    to reduce bureaucracy, remove inefficiencies, and help organisations do what they
    can do best: run a business and, hopefully, create a better world. On the other
    hand, organisations can apply Blockchain, as well as other emerging technologies,
    to develop better products and services, create a better customer experience,
    and return control of personal data to the customer. The immutability, verifiability,
    and traceability of data on a blockchain will result in more transparency and
    security, and bring a new level of privacy, currently lost in many countries.
    Finally, individuals will be able to directly transact with their peers, across
    time and space, in a secure manner. It will foster collaboration on a global scale
    unseen before, enabling individuals to help each other and make money along the
    way in new and innovative ways. Cryptography and encryption will ensure that individuals
    can trust each other without knowing each other, opening up new connections and

  zh: 解决本书中讨论的棘手问题需要个人、组织和政府之间的协作努力。政府应开始运用区块链技术来改善公共服务，使做生意和遵守法律变得更加容易。区块链为政府提供了许多减少官僚主义、消除低效和帮助组织发挥最长处：经营业务，希望创造一个更美好的世界的机遇。另一方面，组织也可以运用区块链以及其他新兴技术，开发更好的产品和服务，创造更好的客户体验，并将个人数据的控制权归还给客户。区块链上数据的不可变性、可验证性和可追溯性将带来更多的透明度和安全性，并带来一个目前在许多国家丢失的新层次的隐私。最后，个人将能够以一种安全的方式，直接与他们的同伴进行跨时间和空间的交易。它将促进前所未有的全球范围内的协作，使个人能够互相帮助，并以新的和创新的方式赚钱。密码学和加密技术将确保个人能够在不了解对方的情况下彼此信任，在全球范围内开辟新的联系和贸易。
- en: Solving the identity crisis will be a catalyst for solving the other Wicked
    Problems. Offering every citizen a digital and secure self-sovereign identity
    enables them to interact with other individuals, organisations, and governments
    in a secure, transparent and private manner. This would require governments to
    embrace blockchain and other emerging technologies, similar to the Estonian model,
    and create a digital-first strategy. Governments should no longer focus only on
    attracting companies with tax benefits, but also on those with efficiency benefits.
    Governments should remove any bureaucratic inefficiencies for organisations and
    individuals. After all, a government is a data organisation as well, which happens
    to enable a free, safe, equal, prosperous, clean environment in their citizens’
    best interests. Once self-sovereign identities are commonplace, it will become
    a lot easier to solve the other Wicked Problems and create a fair, transparent,
    and secure world for all. Of course, this does not mean that solving the other
    Wicked Problems can wait until we have a self-sovereign identity system in place.
    Existing organisations and start-ups, as well as governments and individuals,
    should embrace Blockchain technologies today to create a better world for tomorrow,
    by reducing climate change, ending poverty/corruption/fraud/money laundering and
    improving our democracies and Fair Trade. The technology is here and there is
    not a moment to lose.

  zh: 解决身份危机将是解决其他棘手问题的关键。为每个公民提供一种数字化和安全的自我主权身份，使他们能够以一种安全、透明和私密的方式与其他个人、组织和政府互动。这需要政府像爱沙尼亚模式一样接受区块链和其他新兴技术，并制定以数字优先的策略。政府不应再只专注于通过税收优惠吸引公司，还应关注那些具有效率优势的公司。政府应消除组织和个人的官僚低效。毕竟，政府也是一个数据组织，它碰巧使公民在最佳利益下享有自由、安全、平等、繁荣和清洁的环境。一旦自我主权身份变得普遍，解决其他棘手问题并将公平、透明和安全的世界带给所有人将变得更加容易。当然，这并不意味着我们可以等待自我主权身份系统的建立来解决其他棘手问题。现有的组织、初创公司、政府和个体应立即接受区块链技术，通过减少气候变化、结束贫困/腐败/欺诈/洗钱并改善我们的民主和公平贸易，为明天的更好世界创造条件。技术已经在这里，没有一刻可以浪费。
