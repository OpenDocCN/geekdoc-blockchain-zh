- en: 'CHAPTER 2The Political EntrepreneurWhatever your aims are as an aspiring crypto
    entrepreneur, your success will disrupt the status quo of money and finance. They
    have power: these organizations are in control of their situation and can influence
    their future to their benefit. You will succeed in your mission and maintain the
    health of your organization if and when you replace that status quo. Your success
    is predatory; it lives off energy taken from the incumbent. We have to study the
    relationship between entrepreneurship and political power so that we are aware
    of the type of pressure that regulators and banks could apply to a crypto-organization.Notice
    how unusual it is to use the word “power” in an entrepreneurial context. Power
    is a political concept, and traditional startup companies have little to do with
    politics. Old-school entrepreneurs take the laws and regulations as a given and
    play it as it lays. Most entrepreneurs stay clear of the friction that comes from
    going against the political grain. Only the most successful entrepreneurs whose
    technology influences societal trends, activism, and election outcomes become
    politically relevant. If the politicians already have issues with a disrupted
    media landscape, as we saw in the case of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, we
    can expect that conflict to escalate with the introduction of disruptive money.
    Therefore, a crypto startup is more likely to succeed when it engages political
    power as part of its business model. You are going to get customers who used to
    be captives of elite institutions. The new crypto-assets that a startup creates
    and earns for its stakeholders take power and wealth away from traditional financial
    institutions.Free Market Technology with Political TeethThe internet is a catalyst
    for the general trend of decentralization that started after WWII. At the time,
    most of society was organized in large corporations and large governments. People
    enjoyed a uniform culture broadcast by mass media such as TV, newspapers, and
    radio (Tim Wu, The Master Switch , 2010). Information technology eroded traditional
    media such as newspapers and TV, while empowering marginalized groups and individuals
    through message boards and social media. We now live in a ‘custom-made’ society
    with differing lifestyles, cocoons, and echo chambers. Western societies especially
    are highly democratized, with power distributed among a large number of institutions
    and constituencies. Information technology tends to make society more open and
    flat, less hierarchical, and it tends to develop in cycles. First, an inventor
    makes a new medium available. As entrepreneurs learn the commercial angles of
    the medium, companies fight over the market, until the information flows from
    producers to consumers through corporate channels, curated and censored by the
    political status quo.Software is eating the world (Marc Andreessen in the Wall
    Street Journal, Why Software is Eating the World , 2011). For example computers
    connected by the internet have eaten snail mail, newspapers, radio, TV, music,
    and books. Money and the financial industry were immune to that trend for a long
    time. Since the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, all the money in circulation
    depended on central political power. The Bretton Woods System was backed by gold
    but ended in the early 70s when the U.S. stopped exchanging gold for dollars.
    However, the political foundation of currency remained: since then, in almost
    every country, the central bank creates fiat money which is used for payments
    as physical paper or electronic transfers between licensed banks. People trust
    fiat money for payments because of that political backing. Creating money was
    a privilege of sovereign entities: to win trust, the organization needs the political
    power to claim and defend the sole right to print money. Entrepreneurs had no
    reason to look at money and finance as value propositions because that political
    dependence ruled out competition from private entities. Law enforcement authorities
    have and will shut down any company that creates a private digital currency that
    succeeds. There was no sense in undermining the sovereignty of a state, so the
    software industry did not attempt to build products that “eat” money and finance.Shutting
    down a successful cryptocurrency is either impossible or prohibitively expensive.
    Bitcoin has a track record of immunity to political meddling; it is slippery on
    the defense and an indirect threat to any central bank or government that mismanages
    its money supply and public finances. Furthermore, banks are no longer the gatekeepers
    of financial progress. Any startup can offer a financial or payment service on
    top of a cryptocurrency. As the liquidity of cryptocurrencies grows, these new
    financial services will draw customers away from banks and perhaps even insurance
    companies, investment funds, and other financial institutions.A Cryptocurrency
    is a Virtual JurisdictionThree technical problems prevented the issuance of private,
    decentralized currency: the double-spend problem, decentralized consensus, and
    provably fair issuance of new money. Before the invention of cryptocurrencies,
    these obstacles prevented a guarantee of scarcity, which is needed for people
    to trust an asset as money. The launch of Bitcoin opened a new playing field.
    Private parties can now rely on software for transacting and storing value. Digital
    scarcity gives anyone a choice: you have the option to transact with fiat currency
    on closed corporate networks, or decentralized cryptocurrencies and exchanges.
    That choice will erode the power of banks.A crypto entrepreneur has to understand
    the role of political power in the money system. As it is, let us assume that
    political action is not a standard piece of your strategy. To a typical entrepreneur,
    political action looks like an unrewarding game. The type of person who starts
    a company is unlikely to consider a career as a politician, with the exception
    of established billionaires. On the contrary, an up-and-coming entrepreneur believes
    in free markets, voluntary transactions, plus-sum games, open innovation, satisfied
    customers, and profits earned by fair competition. These values have little to
    do with political action. However, the power of fiat money is political, to disrupt
    it your information technology needs the teeth to match and exceed that power.You
    could say that an immutable blockchain is a global, voluntary, virtual jurisdiction.
    You could also call it a ‘smart jurisdiction’ for ‘smart contracts.’ Bitcoin and
    Ethereum are not in a specific place; they function on the internet, as a global
    and distributed network. On a decentralized system, people transact, but their
    assets do not reside in a particular place. The people, when identified, might
    be subject to a traditional jurisdiction or another, but this is new technology,
    and the way the rules apply is vague, new, and most likely not defined. That is
    an advantage for people who choose to take responsibility for all the consequences
    of their transactions, both good and bad. Whatever financial game you are playing,
    there is no automatic authority there. The field is free and open. With the narrow
    exception of earned income, if a regulator has an issue with your transactions,
    the burden of discovery and investigation lies with them. You do not have to ask
    for permission; instead, they have to come to you and explain the rules, should
    they even bother. For example, if international travelers memorize the keys of
    an undeclared wallet with one million dollars worth of cryptocurrency, are they
    breaking the rule that says you must declare cash worth more than ten thousand
    dollars?Sovereign entities at odds with the established banking system already
    use crypto-assets—to apply an idea by Von Clausewitz—as a continuation of politics
    by other means. If politicians in North Korea and Iran achieve their ends using
    crypto-assets, should not others be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we
    are not used to thinking and acting as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility
    of free currency.Building on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire
    more ‘law’-like capabilities and more functionality for fundraising, they can
    compete with nation-states that rely on traditional laws. They become virtual
    jurisdictions: nation-like entities that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs,
    as agents of these sovereign entities, have to practice diplomacy. This territory
    of freedom has an analogy in the separation of church and state, which happened
    around five centuries ago in some places (Erik Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation
    of Money and State is the New Separation of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic
    church lost exclusive authority over its territory of religion, and also lost
    its jurisdiction over physical area to nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states
    and banks will lose their influence over money and finance (Martin van Creveld,
    The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We already have historical examples of
    decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes issued by private banks. That
    decentralized money disappeared when governments and banks founded central banks
    to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce decentralized money, with the
    added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat currency works similarly to
    banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by government debt. A central bank
    buys financial products on the open market, usually government bonds. It pays
    for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of the money is paper cash, but
    most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means that the government bonds
    become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and the created money is a
    liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends this money to private
    banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives fiat money back, it
    can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total supply in circulation.
    Other private regulated banks can also issue money through ‘fractional reserve’.
    They can lend out more money than they receive from the central bank or customers
    because they can expect most of their customers to keep their money in the bank.
    See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and money creation.The system
    of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public. The central bank can only
    circulate money that people trust will hold its value well enough. And ordinary
    banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve. Most of their customers
    keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion of these customers withdraw
    their money at any given time. A bank can maintain that fractional reserve as
    long as their customers trust that they can withdraw their money at any time.
    When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank run . In case a large portion
    of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and the bank does not have enough
    fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations, then that bank needs the central
    bank or the government to act as a lender of last resort. If no more significant
    lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s obligations, then it goes bankrupt.
    It is a sophisticated but centralized system. Crypto enthusiasts work on a future
    where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will
    replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat currency. We can expect
    cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features of the banking sector,
    and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders of magnitude. These new
    companies will share the benefits of this new financial system with their customers,
    which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies empower a slow but deliberate
    run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur who nibbles at
    the power that comes from sovereignty, you have to remember: It is not what you
    do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said that Bitcoin gives us, the users
    of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom. He acknowledged that you would not
    find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but “we can win a major
    battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.”
    (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings of Bitcoin Creator
    Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an essential idea for
    crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory of freedom? Technologies
    that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets, and the removal of friction
    in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said: “Governments are good at cutting
    off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks
    like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test
    was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of drugs,” where decentralized money
    proved resistant to coercion from regulation and law enforcement. People traded
    illegal goods on hidden websites, and they still do. The founder of the Silk Road,
    Ross Ulbright, did get caught because he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed
    off law enforcement agencies so much that they unleashed more force against him
    than his operational security could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie
    Shrem, battled with financial regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous
    trades are now under pressure to make their customers known. Not all companies
    that rely on a blockchain can defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin
    network itself has survived its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can
    stop this entity. Understanding why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part
    of your education on crypto-assets.Any entrepreneur who offers a product or service
    in a gray area has to prepare for battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset
    ATM providers, over-the-counter traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate
    in this gray area. Are you going to operate under a known brand, above the radar?
    Then your venture needs specialized legal advice before you even get started.
    Your executive team needs to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative
    is to keep your activities so far below the radar that regulators will not bother
    stopping you. Then you take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency
    without raising the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter
    traders can make a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to
    the law in most jurisdictions, they need a money transmitter license and comply
    with KYC/AML regulations. However, because the amounts they trade are either small
    or below the radar, they are not worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue
    working because, so far, they do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing
    a token without registering with the regulator. Some people run a project that
    is so small that they are willing to take the risk of unregulated business, rather
    than accepting the cost of getting permission. In case a startup company wants
    to sail close to the wind concerning rules, again, it is best with an attorney
    on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by
    a conflict with a nation-state adversary. The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous,
    and they organized themselves in companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum
    doubt whether it can withstand an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs
    a Silk Road-moment to show that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How
    Much Security Do You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional
    risk. They are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms
    so that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.The Political EntrepreneurWhatever your aims
    are as an aspiring crypto entrepreneur, your success will disrupt the status quo
    of money and finance. They have power: these organizations are in control of their

    replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat currency. We can expect
    cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features of the banking sector,
    and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders of magnitude. These new
    companies will share the benefits of this new financial system with their customers,
    which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies empower a slow but deliberate
    run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur who nibbles at
    the power that comes from sovereignty, you have to remember: It is not what you
    do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said that Bitcoin gives us, the users
    of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom. He acknowledged that you would not
    find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but “we can win a major
    battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.”
    (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings of Bitcoin Creator
    Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an essential idea for
    crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory of freedom? Technologies
    that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets, and the removal of friction
    in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said: “Governments are good at cutting
    off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks
    like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test
    was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of drugs,” where decentralized money
    proved resistant to coercion from regulation and law enforcement. People traded
    illegal goods on hidden websites, and they still do. The founder of the Silk Road,
    Ross Ulbright, did get caught because he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed
    off law enforcement agencies so much that they unleashed more force against him
    than his operational security could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie
    Shrem, battled with financial regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous
    trades are now under pressure to make their customers known. Not all companies
    that rely on a blockchain can defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin
    network itself has survived its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can
    stop this entity. Understanding why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part
    of your education on crypto-assets.Any entrepreneur who offers a product or service
    in a gray area has to prepare for battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset
    ATM providers, over-the-counter traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate
    in this gray area. Are you going to operate under a known brand, above the radar?
    Then your venture needs specialized legal advice before you even get started.
    Your executive team needs to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative
    is to keep your activities so far below the radar that regulators will not bother
    stopping you. Then you take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency
    without raising the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter
    traders can make a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to
    the law in most jurisdictions, they need a money transmitter license and comply
    with KYC/AML regulations. However, because the amounts they trade are either small
    or below the radar, they are not worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue
    working because, so far, they do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing
    a token without registering with the regulator. Some people run a project that
    is so small that they are willing to take the risk of unregulated business, rather
    than accepting the cost of getting permission. In case a startup company wants
    to sail close to the wind concerning rules, again, it is best with an attorney
    on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by
    a conflict with a nation-state adversary. The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous,
    and they organized themselves in companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum
    doubt whether it can withstand an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs
    a Silk Road-moment to show that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How
    Much Security Do You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional
    risk. They are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms
    so that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.Whatever your aims are as an aspiring crypto
    entrepreneur, your success will disrupt the status quo of money and finance. They
    have power: these organizations are in control of their situation and can influence
    their future to their benefit. You will succeed in your mission and maintain the
    health of your organization if and when you replace that status quo. Your success
    is predatory; it lives off energy taken from the incumbent. We have to study the
    relationship between entrepreneurship and political power so that we are aware
    of the type of pressure that regulators and banks could apply to a crypto-organization.Notice
    how unusual it is to use the word “power” in an entrepreneurial context. Power
    is a political concept, and traditional startup companies have little to do with
    politics. Old-school entrepreneurs take the laws and regulations as a given and
    play it as it lays. Most entrepreneurs stay clear of the friction that comes from
    going against the political grain. Only the most successful entrepreneurs whose
    technology influences societal trends, activism, and election outcomes become
    politically relevant. If the politicians already have issues with a disrupted
    media landscape, as we saw in the case of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, we
    can expect that conflict to escalate with the introduction of disruptive money.
    Therefore, a crypto startup is more likely to succeed when it engages political
    power as part of its business model. You are going to get customers who used to
    be captives of elite institutions. The new crypto-assets that a startup creates
    and earns for its stakeholders take power and wealth away from traditional financial
    institutions.Free Market Technology with Political TeethThe internet is a catalyst
    for the general trend of decentralization that started after WWII. At the time,
    most of society was organized in large corporations and large governments. People
    enjoyed a uniform culture broadcast by mass media such as TV, newspapers, and
    radio (Tim Wu, The Master Switch , 2010). Information technology eroded traditional
    media such as newspapers and TV, while empowering marginalized groups and individuals
    through message boards and social media. We now live in a ‘custom-made’ society
    with differing lifestyles, cocoons, and echo chambers. Western societies especially
    are highly democratized, with power distributed among a large number of institutions
    and constituencies. Information technology tends to make society more open and
    flat, less hierarchical, and it tends to develop in cycles. First, an inventor
    makes a new medium available. As entrepreneurs learn the commercial angles of
    the medium, companies fight over the market, until the information flows from
    producers to consumers through corporate channels, curated and censored by the
    political status quo.Software is eating the world (Marc Andreessen in the Wall
    Street Journal, Why Software is Eating the World , 2011). For example computers
    connected by the internet have eaten snail mail, newspapers, radio, TV, music,
    and books. Money and the financial industry were immune to that trend for a long
    time. Since the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, all the money in circulation
    depended on central political power. The Bretton Woods System was backed by gold
    but ended in the early 70s when the U.S. stopped exchanging gold for dollars.
    However, the political foundation of currency remained: since then, in almost
    every country, the central bank creates fiat money which is used for payments
    as physical paper or electronic transfers between licensed banks. People trust
    fiat money for payments because of that political backing. Creating money was
    a privilege of sovereign entities: to win trust, the organization needs the political
    power to claim and defend the sole right to print money. Entrepreneurs had no
    reason to look at money and finance as value propositions because that political
    dependence ruled out competition from private entities. Law enforcement authorities
    have and will shut down any company that creates a private digital currency that
    succeeds. There was no sense in undermining the sovereignty of a state, so the
    software industry did not attempt to build products that “eat” money and finance.Shutting
    down a successful cryptocurrency is either impossible or prohibitively expensive.
    Bitcoin has a track record of immunity to political meddling; it is slippery on
    the defense and an indirect threat to any central bank or government that mismanages
    its money supply and public finances. Furthermore, banks are no longer the gatekeepers
    of financial progress. Any startup can offer a financial or payment service on
    top of a cryptocurrency. As the liquidity of cryptocurrencies grows, these new
    financial services will draw customers away from banks and perhaps even insurance
    companies, investment funds, and other financial institutions.A Cryptocurrency
    is a Virtual JurisdictionThree technical problems prevented the issuance of private,
    decentralized currency: the double-spend problem, decentralized consensus, and
    provably fair issuance of new money. Before the invention of cryptocurrencies,
    these obstacles prevented a guarantee of scarcity, which is needed for people
    to trust an asset as money. The launch of Bitcoin opened a new playing field.
    Private parties can now rely on software for transacting and storing value. Digital
    scarcity gives anyone a choice: you have the option to transact with fiat currency
    on closed corporate networks, or decentralized cryptocurrencies and exchanges.
    That choice will erode the power of banks.A crypto entrepreneur has to understand
    the role of political power in the money system. As it is, let us assume that
    political action is not a standard piece of your strategy. To a typical entrepreneur,
    political action looks like an unrewarding game. The type of person who starts
    a company is unlikely to consider a career as a politician, with the exception
    of established billionaires. On the contrary, an up-and-coming entrepreneur believes
    in free markets, voluntary transactions, plus-sum games, open innovation, satisfied
    customers, and profits earned by fair competition. These values have little to
    do with political action. However, the power of fiat money is political, to disrupt
    it your information technology needs the teeth to match and exceed that power.You
    could say that an immutable blockchain is a global, voluntary, virtual jurisdiction.
    You could also call it a ‘smart jurisdiction’ for ‘smart contracts.’ Bitcoin and
    Ethereum are not in a specific place; they function on the internet, as a global
    and distributed network. On a decentralized system, people transact, but their
    assets do not reside in a particular place. The people, when identified, might
    be subject to a traditional jurisdiction or another, but this is new technology,
    and the way the rules apply is vague, new, and most likely not defined. That is
    an advantage for people who choose to take responsibility for all the consequences
    of their transactions, both good and bad. Whatever financial game you are playing,
    there is no automatic authority there. The field is free and open. With the narrow
    exception of earned income, if a regulator has an issue with your transactions,
    the burden of discovery and investigation lies with them. You do not have to ask
    for permission; instead, they have to come to you and explain the rules, should
    they even bother. For example, if international travelers memorize the keys of
    an undeclared wallet with one million dollars worth of cryptocurrency, are they
    breaking the rule that says you must declare cash worth more than ten thousand
    dollars?Sovereign entities at odds with the established banking system already
    use crypto-assets—to apply an idea by Von Clausewitz—as a continuation of politics
    by other means. If politicians in North Korea and Iran achieve their ends using
    crypto-assets, should not others be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we
    are not used to thinking and acting as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility
    of free currency.Building on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire
    more ‘law’-like capabilities and more functionality for fundraising, they can
    compete with nation-states that rely on traditional laws. They become virtual
    jurisdictions: nation-like entities that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs,
    as agents of these sovereign entities, have to practice diplomacy. This territory
    of freedom has an analogy in the separation of church and state, which happened
    around five centuries ago in some places (Erik Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation
    of Money and State is the New Separation of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic
    church lost exclusive authority over its territory of religion, and also lost
    its jurisdiction over physical area to nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states
    and banks will lose their influence over money and finance (Martin van Creveld,
    The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We already have historical examples of
    decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes issued by private banks. That
    decentralized money disappeared when governments and banks founded central banks
    to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce decentralized money, with the
    added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat currency works similarly to
    banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by government debt. A central bank
    buys financial products on the open market, usually government bonds. It pays
    for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of the money is paper cash, but
    most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means that the government bonds
    become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and the created money is a
    liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends this money to private
    banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives fiat money back, it
    can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total supply in circulation.
    Other private regulated banks can also issue money through ‘fractional reserve’.
    They can lend out more money than they receive from the central bank or customers
    because they can expect most of their customers to keep their money in the bank.
    See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and money creation.The system
    of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public. The central bank can only
    circulate money that people trust will hold its value well enough. And ordinary
    banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve. Most of their customers
    keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion of these customers withdraw
    their money at any given time. A bank can maintain that fractional reserve as
    long as their customers trust that they can withdraw their money at any time.
    When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank run . In case a large portion
    of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and the bank does not have enough
    fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations, then that bank needs the central
    bank or the government to act as a lender of last resort. If no more significant
    lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s obligations, then it goes bankrupt.
    It is a sophisticated but centralized system. Crypto enthusiasts work on a future
    where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will
    replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat currency. We can expect
    cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features of the banking sector,
    and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders of magnitude. These new
    companies will share the benefits of this new financial system with their customers,
    which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies empower a slow but deliberate
    run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur who nibbles at

    such as TV, newspapers, and radio (Tim Wu, The Master Switch , 2010). Information
    technology eroded traditional media such as newspapers and TV, while empowering
    marginalized groups and individuals through message boards and social media. We
    now live in a ‘custom-made’ society with differing lifestyles, cocoons, and echo
    chambers. Western societies especially are highly democratized, with power distributed
    among a large number of institutions and constituencies. Information technology
    tends to make society more open and flat, less hierarchical, and it tends to develop
    in cycles. First, an inventor makes a new medium available. As entrepreneurs learn
    the commercial angles of the medium, companies fight over the market, until the
    information flows from producers to consumers through corporate channels, curated
    and censored by the political status quo.Software is eating the world (Marc Andreessen
    in the Wall Street Journal, Why Software is Eating the World , 2011). For example
    computers connected by the internet have eaten snail mail, newspapers, radio,
    TV, music, and books. Money and the financial industry were immune to that trend
    for a long time. Since the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, all the money in circulation
    depended on central political power. The Bretton Woods System was backed by gold
    but ended in the early 70s when the U.S. stopped exchanging gold for dollars.
    However, the political foundation of currency remained: since then, in almost
    every country, the central bank creates fiat money which is used for payments
    as physical paper or electronic transfers between licensed banks. People trust
    fiat money for payments because of that political backing. Creating money was
    a privilege of sovereign entities: to win trust, the organization needs the political
    power to claim and defend the sole right to print money. Entrepreneurs had no
    reason to look at money and finance as value propositions because that political
    dependence ruled out competition from private entities. Law enforcement authorities
    have and will shut down any company that creates a private digital currency that
    succeeds. There was no sense in undermining the sovereignty of a state, so the
    software industry did not attempt to build products that “eat” money and finance.Shutting
    down a successful cryptocurrency is either impossible or prohibitively expensive.
    Bitcoin has a track record of immunity to political meddling; it is slippery on
    the defense and an indirect threat to any central bank or government that mismanages
    its money supply and public finances. Furthermore, banks are no longer the gatekeepers
    of financial progress. Any startup can offer a financial or payment service on
    top of a cryptocurrency. As the liquidity of cryptocurrencies grows, these new
    financial services will draw customers away from banks and perhaps even insurance
    companies, investment funds, and other financial institutions.A Cryptocurrency
    is a Virtual JurisdictionThree technical problems prevented the issuance of private,
    decentralized currency: the double-spend problem, decentralized consensus, and
    provably fair issuance of new money. Before the invention of cryptocurrencies,
    these obstacles prevented a guarantee of scarcity, which is needed for people
    to trust an asset as money. The launch of Bitcoin opened a new playing field.
    Private parties can now rely on software for transacting and storing value. Digital
    scarcity gives anyone a choice: you have the option to transact with fiat currency
    on closed corporate networks, or decentralized cryptocurrencies and exchanges.
    That choice will erode the power of banks.A crypto entrepreneur has to understand
    the role of political power in the money system. As it is, let us assume that
    political action is not a standard piece of your strategy. To a typical entrepreneur,
    political action looks like an unrewarding game. The type of person who starts
    a company is unlikely to consider a career as a politician, with the exception
    of established billionaires. On the contrary, an up-and-coming entrepreneur believes
    in free markets, voluntary transactions, plus-sum games, open innovation, satisfied
    customers, and profits earned by fair competition. These values have little to
    do with political action. However, the power of fiat money is political, to disrupt
    it your information technology needs the teeth to match and exceed that power.You
    could say that an immutable blockchain is a global, voluntary, virtual jurisdiction.
    You could also call it a ‘smart jurisdiction’ for ‘smart contracts.’ Bitcoin and
    Ethereum are not in a specific place; they function on the internet, as a global
    and distributed network. On a decentralized system, people transact, but their
    assets do not reside in a particular place. The people, when identified, might
    be subject to a traditional jurisdiction or another, but this is new technology,
    and the way the rules apply is vague, new, and most likely not defined. That is
    an advantage for people who choose to take responsibility for all the consequences
    of their transactions, both good and bad. Whatever financial game you are playing,
    there is no automatic authority there. The field is free and open. With the narrow
    exception of earned income, if a regulator has an issue with your transactions,
    the burden of discovery and investigation lies with them. You do not have to ask
    for permission; instead, they have to come to you and explain the rules, should
    they even bother. For example, if international travelers memorize the keys of
    an undeclared wallet with one million dollars worth of cryptocurrency, are they
    breaking the rule that says you must declare cash worth more than ten thousand
    dollars?Sovereign entities at odds with the established banking system already
    use crypto-assets—to apply an idea by Von Clausewitz—as a continuation of politics
    by other means. If politicians in North Korea and Iran achieve their ends using
    crypto-assets, should not others be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we
    are not used to thinking and acting as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility
    of free currency.Building on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire
    more ‘law’-like capabilities and more functionality for fundraising, they can
    compete with nation-states that rely on traditional laws. They become virtual
    jurisdictions: nation-like entities that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs,
    as agents of these sovereign entities, have to practice diplomacy. This territory
    of freedom has an analogy in the separation of church and state, which happened
    around five centuries ago in some places (Erik Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation
    of Money and State is the New Separation of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic
    church lost exclusive authority over its territory of religion, and also lost
    its jurisdiction over physical area to nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states
    and banks will lose their influence over money and finance (Martin van Creveld,
    The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We already have historical examples of
    decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes issued by private banks. That
    decentralized money disappeared when governments and banks founded central banks
    to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce decentralized money, with the
    added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat currency works similarly to
    banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by government debt. A central bank
    buys financial products on the open market, usually government bonds. It pays
    for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of the money is paper cash, but
    most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means that the government bonds
    become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and the created money is a
    liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends this money to private
    banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives fiat money back, it
    can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total supply in circulation.
    Other private regulated banks can also issue money through ‘fractional reserve’.
    They can lend out more money than they receive from the central bank or customers
    because they can expect most of their customers to keep their money in the bank.
    See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and money creation.The system
    of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public. The central bank can only
    circulate money that people trust will hold its value well enough. And ordinary
    banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve. Most of their customers
    keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion of these customers withdraw
    their money at any given time. A bank can maintain that fractional reserve as
    long as their customers trust that they can withdraw their money at any time.
    When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank run . In case a large portion
    of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and the bank does not have enough
    fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations, then that bank needs the central
    bank or the government to act as a lender of last resort. If no more significant
    lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s obligations, then it goes bankrupt.
    It is a sophisticated but centralized system. Crypto enthusiasts work on a future
    where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will
    replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat currency. We can expect
    cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features of the banking sector,
    and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders of magnitude. These new
    companies will share the benefits of this new financial system with their customers,
    which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies empower a slow but deliberate
    run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur who nibbles at
    the power that comes from sovereignty, you have to remember: It is not what you
    do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said that Bitcoin gives us, the users
    of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom. He acknowledged that you would not
    find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but “we can win a major
    battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.”
    (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings of Bitcoin Creator
    Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an essential idea for
    crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory of freedom? Technologies
    that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets, and the removal of friction
    in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said: “Governments are good at cutting
    off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks
    like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test
    was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of drugs,” where decentralized money
    proved resistant to coercion from regulation and law enforcement. People traded
    illegal goods on hidden websites, and they still do. The founder of the Silk Road,
    Ross Ulbright, did get caught because he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed
    off law enforcement agencies so much that they unleashed more force against him
    than his operational security could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie
    Shrem, battled with financial regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous
    trades are now under pressure to make their customers known. Not all companies
    that rely on a blockchain can defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin
    network itself has survived its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can
    stop this entity. Understanding why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part
    of your education on crypto-assets.Any entrepreneur who offers a product or service
    in a gray area has to prepare for battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset
    ATM providers, over-the-counter traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate
    in this gray area. Are you going to operate under a known brand, above the radar?
    Then your venture needs specialized legal advice before you even get started.
    Your executive team needs to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative
    is to keep your activities so far below the radar that regulators will not bother
    stopping you. Then you take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency
    without raising the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter
    traders can make a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to
    the law in most jurisdictions, they need a money transmitter license and comply
    with KYC/AML regulations. However, because the amounts they trade are either small
    or below the radar, they are not worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue
    working because, so far, they do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing
    a token without registering with the regulator. Some people run a project that
    is so small that they are willing to take the risk of unregulated business, rather
    than accepting the cost of getting permission. In case a startup company wants
    to sail close to the wind concerning rules, again, it is best with an attorney
    on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by
    a conflict with a nation-state adversary. The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous,
    and they organized themselves in companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum
    doubt whether it can withstand an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs
    a Silk Road-moment to show that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How
    Much Security Do You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional
    risk. They are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms
    so that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.Free Market Technology with Political TeethThe
    internet is a catalyst for the general trend of decentralization that started
    after WWII. At the time, most of society was organized in large corporations and
    large governments. People enjoyed a uniform culture broadcast by mass media such
    as TV, newspapers, and radio (Tim Wu, The Master Switch , 2010). Information technology
    eroded traditional media such as newspapers and TV, while empowering marginalized
    groups and individuals through message boards and social media. We now live in
    a ‘custom-made’ society with differing lifestyles, cocoons, and echo chambers.
    Western societies especially are highly democratized, with power distributed among
    a large number of institutions and constituencies. Information technology tends
    to make society more open and flat, less hierarchical, and it tends to develop
    in cycles. First, an inventor makes a new medium available. As entrepreneurs learn
    the commercial angles of the medium, companies fight over the market, until the
    information flows from producers to consumers through corporate channels, curated
    and censored by the political status quo.Software is eating the world (Marc Andreessen
    in the Wall Street Journal, Why Software is Eating the World , 2011). For example
    computers connected by the internet have eaten snail mail, newspapers, radio,
    TV, music, and books. Money and the financial industry were immune to that trend
    for a long time. Since the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, all the money in circulation
    depended on central political power. The Bretton Woods System was backed by gold
    but ended in the early 70s when the U.S. stopped exchanging gold for dollars.
    However, the political foundation of currency remained: since then, in almost
    every country, the central bank creates fiat money which is used for payments
    as physical paper or electronic transfers between licensed banks. People trust
    fiat money for payments because of that political backing. Creating money was
    a privilege of sovereign entities: to win trust, the organization needs the political
    power to claim and defend the sole right to print money. Entrepreneurs had no
    reason to look at money and finance as value propositions because that political
    dependence ruled out competition from private entities. Law enforcement authorities
    have and will shut down any company that creates a private digital currency that
    succeeds. There was no sense in undermining the sovereignty of a state, so the
    software industry did not attempt to build products that “eat” money and finance.Shutting
    down a successful cryptocurrency is either impossible or prohibitively expensive.
    Bitcoin has a track record of immunity to political meddling; it is slippery on
    the defense and an indirect threat to any central bank or government that mismanages
    its money supply and public finances. Furthermore, banks are no longer the gatekeepers
    of financial progress. Any startup can offer a financial or payment service on
    top of a cryptocurrency. As the liquidity of cryptocurrencies grows, these new
    financial services will draw customers away from banks and perhaps even insurance
    companies, investment funds, and other financial institutions.A Cryptocurrency
    is a Virtual JurisdictionThree technical problems prevented the issuance of private,

    a company is unlikely to consider a career as a politician, with the exception
    of established billionaires. On the contrary, an up-and-coming entrepreneur believes
    in free markets, voluntary transactions, plus-sum games, open innovation, satisfied
    customers, and profits earned by fair competition. These values have little to
    do with political action. However, the power of fiat money is political, to disrupt
    it your information technology needs the teeth to match and exceed that power.You
    could say that an immutable blockchain is a global, voluntary, virtual jurisdiction.
    You could also call it a ‘smart jurisdiction’ for ‘smart contracts.’ Bitcoin and
    Ethereum are not in a specific place; they function on the internet, as a global
    and distributed network. On a decentralized system, people transact, but their
    assets do not reside in a particular place. The people, when identified, might
    be subject to a traditional jurisdiction or another, but this is new technology,
    and the way the rules apply is vague, new, and most likely not defined. That is
    an advantage for people who choose to take responsibility for all the consequences
    of their transactions, both good and bad. Whatever financial game you are playing,

    by other means. If politicians in North Korea and Iran achieve their ends using
    crypto-assets, should not others be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we
    are not used to thinking and acting as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility
    of free currency.Building on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire
    more ‘law’-like capabilities and more functionality for fundraising, they can
    compete with nation-states that rely on traditional laws. They become virtual
    jurisdictions: nation-like entities that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs,
    as agents of these sovereign entities, have to practice diplomacy. This territory
    of freedom has an analogy in the separation of church and state, which happened
    around five centuries ago in some places (Erik Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation
    of Money and State is the New Separation of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic
    church lost exclusive authority over its territory of religion, and also lost
    its jurisdiction over physical area to nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states
    and banks will lose their influence over money and finance (Martin van Creveld,
    The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We already have historical examples of
    decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes issued by private banks. That
    decentralized money disappeared when governments and banks founded central banks
    to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce decentralized money, with the
    added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat currency works similarly to
    banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by government debt. A central bank
    buys financial products on the open market, usually government bonds. It pays
    for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of the money is paper cash, but
    most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means that the government bonds
    become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and the created money is a
    liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends this money to private
    banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives fiat money back, it
    can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total supply in circulation.
    Other private regulated banks can also issue money through ‘fractional reserve’.
    They can lend out more money than they receive from the central bank or customers
    because they can expect most of their customers to keep their money in the bank.
    See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and money creation.The system
    of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public. The central bank can only
    circulate money that people trust will hold its value well enough. And ordinary
    banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve. Most of their customers
    keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion of these customers withdraw
    their money at any given time. A bank can maintain that fractional reserve as
    long as their customers trust that they can withdraw their money at any time.
    When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank run . In case a large portion
    of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and the bank does not have enough
    fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations, then that bank needs the central
    bank or the government to act as a lender of last resort. If no more significant
    lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s obligations, then it goes bankrupt.
    It is a sophisticated but centralized system. Crypto enthusiasts work on a future
    where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will
    replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat currency. We can expect
    cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features of the banking sector,
    and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders of magnitude. These new
    companies will share the benefits of this new financial system with their customers,
    which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies empower a slow but deliberate
    run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur who nibbles at
    the power that comes from sovereignty, you have to remember: It is not what you
    do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said that Bitcoin gives us, the users
    of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom. He acknowledged that you would not
    find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but “we can win a major
    battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.”
    (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings of Bitcoin Creator
    Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an essential idea for
    crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory of freedom? Technologies
    that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets, and the removal of friction

    the law in most jurisdictions, they need a money transmitter license and comply
    with KYC/AML regulations. However, because the amounts they trade are either small
    or below the radar, they are not worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue
    working because, so far, they do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing
    a token without registering with the regulator. Some people run a project that
    is so small that they are willing to take the risk of unregulated business, rather
    than accepting the cost of getting permission. In case a startup company wants
    to sail close to the wind concerning rules, again, it is best with an attorney
    on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by
    a conflict with a nation-state adversary. The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous,
    and they organized themselves in companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum
    doubt whether it can withstand an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs
    a Silk Road-moment to show that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How
    Much Security Do You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional
    risk. They are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms
    so that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.The internet is a catalyst for the general
    trend of decentralization that started after WWII. At the time, most of society
    was organized in large corporations and large governments. People enjoyed a uniform
    culture broadcast by mass media such as TV, newspapers, and radio (Tim Wu, The
    Master Switch , 2010). Information technology eroded traditional media such as
    newspapers and TV, while empowering marginalized groups and individuals through
    message boards and social media. We now live in a ‘custom-made’ society with differing
    lifestyles, cocoons, and echo chambers. Western societies especially are highly
    democratized, with power distributed among a large number of institutions and
    constituencies. Information technology tends to make society more open and flat,
    less hierarchical, and it tends to develop in cycles. First, an inventor makes
    a new medium available. As entrepreneurs learn the commercial angles of the medium,
    companies fight over the market, until the information flows from producers to
    consumers through corporate channels, curated and censored by the political status
    quo.Software is eating the world (Marc Andreessen in the Wall Street Journal,
    Why Software is Eating the World , 2011). For example computers connected by the
    internet have eaten snail mail, newspapers, radio, TV, music, and books. Money
    and the financial industry were immune to that trend for a long time. Since the
    Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, all the money in circulation depended on central
    political power. The Bretton Woods System was backed by gold but ended in the
    early 70s when the U.S. stopped exchanging gold for dollars. However, the political
    foundation of currency remained: since then, in almost every country, the central
    bank creates fiat money which is used for payments as physical paper or electronic
    transfers between licensed banks. People trust fiat money for payments because
    of that political backing. Creating money was a privilege of sovereign entities:
    to win trust, the organization needs the political power to claim and defend the
    sole right to print money. Entrepreneurs had no reason to look at money and finance
    as value propositions because that political dependence ruled out competition
    from private entities. Law enforcement authorities have and will shut down any
    company that creates a private digital currency that succeeds. There was no sense
    in undermining the sovereignty of a state, so the software industry did not attempt
    to build products that “eat” money and finance.Shutting down a successful cryptocurrency
    is either impossible or prohibitively expensive. Bitcoin has a track record of
    immunity to political meddling; it is slippery on the defense and an indirect
    threat to any central bank or government that mismanages its money supply and
    public finances. Furthermore, banks are no longer the gatekeepers of financial
    progress. Any startup can offer a financial or payment service on top of a cryptocurrency.
    As the liquidity of cryptocurrencies grows, these new financial services will
    draw customers away from banks and perhaps even insurance companies, investment
    funds, and other financial institutions.A Cryptocurrency is a Virtual JurisdictionThree
    technical problems prevented the issuance of private, decentralized currency:
    the double-spend problem, decentralized consensus, and provably fair issuance
    of new money. Before the invention of cryptocurrencies, these obstacles prevented
    a guarantee of scarcity, which is needed for people to trust an asset as money.
    The launch of Bitcoin opened a new playing field. Private parties can now rely
    on software for transacting and storing value. Digital scarcity gives anyone a
    choice: you have the option to transact with fiat currency on closed corporate
    networks, or decentralized cryptocurrencies and exchanges. That choice will erode
    the power of banks.A crypto entrepreneur has to understand the role of political
    power in the money system. As it is, let us assume that political action is not
    a standard piece of your strategy. To a typical entrepreneur, political action
    looks like an unrewarding game. The type of person who starts a company is unlikely
    to consider a career as a politician, with the exception of established billionaires.
    On the contrary, an up-and-coming entrepreneur believes in free markets, voluntary
    transactions, plus-sum games, open innovation, satisfied customers, and profits
    earned by fair competition. These values have little to do with political action.
    However, the power of fiat money is political, to disrupt it your information
    technology needs the teeth to match and exceed that power.You could say that an
    immutable blockchain is a global, voluntary, virtual jurisdiction. You could also
    call it a ‘smart jurisdiction’ for ‘smart contracts.’ Bitcoin and Ethereum are
    not in a specific place; they function on the internet, as a global and distributed
    network. On a decentralized system, people transact, but their assets do not reside
    in a particular place. The people, when identified, might be subject to a traditional
    jurisdiction or another, but this is new technology, and the way the rules apply
    is vague, new, and most likely not defined. That is an advantage for people who
    choose to take responsibility for all the consequences of their transactions,
    both good and bad. Whatever financial game you are playing, there is no automatic
    authority there. The field is free and open. With the narrow exception of earned
    income, if a regulator has an issue with your transactions, the burden of discovery
    and investigation lies with them. You do not have to ask for permission; instead,
    they have to come to you and explain the rules, should they even bother. For example,
    if international travelers memorize the keys of an undeclared wallet with one
    million dollars worth of cryptocurrency, are they breaking the rule that says
    you must declare cash worth more than ten thousand dollars?Sovereign entities
    at odds with the established banking system already use crypto-assets—to apply
    an idea by Von Clausewitz—as a continuation of politics by other means. If politicians
    in North Korea and Iran achieve their ends using crypto-assets, should not others
    be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we are not used to thinking and acting
    as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility of free currency.Building
    on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire more ‘law’-like capabilities
    and more functionality for fundraising, they can compete with nation-states that
    rely on traditional laws. They become virtual jurisdictions: nation-like entities
    that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs, as agents of these sovereign entities,
    have to practice diplomacy. This territory of freedom has an analogy in the separation
    of church and state, which happened around five centuries ago in some places (Erik
    Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation of Money and State is the New Separation
    of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic church lost exclusive authority over
    its territory of religion, and also lost its jurisdiction over physical area to
    nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states and banks will lose their influence
    over money and finance (Martin van Creveld, The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We
    already have historical examples of decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes
    issued by private banks. That decentralized money disappeared when governments
    and banks founded central banks to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce
    decentralized money, with the added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat
    currency works similarly to banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by
    government debt. A central bank buys financial products on the open market, usually
    government bonds. It pays for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of
    the money is paper cash, but most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means
    that the government bonds become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and
    the created money is a liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends
    this money to private banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives
    fiat money back, it can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total
    supply in circulation. Other private regulated banks can also issue money through
    ‘fractional reserve’. They can lend out more money than they receive from the
    central bank or customers because they can expect most of their customers to keep
    their money in the bank. See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and
    money creation.The system of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public.
    The central bank can only circulate money that people trust will hold its value
    well enough. And ordinary banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve.
    Most of their customers keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion
    of these customers withdraw their money at any given time. A bank can maintain
    that fractional reserve as long as their customers trust that they can withdraw
    their money at any time. When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank
    run . In case a large portion of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and
    the bank does not have enough fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations,
    then that bank needs the central bank or the government to act as a lender of
    last resort. If no more significant lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s
    obligations, then it goes bankrupt. It is a sophisticated but centralized system.
    Crypto enthusiasts work on a future where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies
    and smart contracts will replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat
    currency. We can expect cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features
    of the banking sector, and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders
    of magnitude. These new companies will share the benefits of this new financial
    system with their customers, which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies
    empower a slow but deliberate run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs
    an entrepreneur who nibbles at the power that comes from sovereignty, you have
    to remember: It is not what you do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said
    that Bitcoin gives us, the users of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom.
    He acknowledged that you would not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,
    but “we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom
    for several years.” (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings
    of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an
    essential idea for crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory
    of freedom? Technologies that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets,
    and the removal of friction in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said:
    “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks
    like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their
    own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of
    drugs,” where decentralized money proved resistant to coercion from regulation
    and law enforcement. People traded illegal goods on hidden websites, and they
    still do. The founder of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbright, did get caught because
    he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed off law enforcement agencies so
    much that they unleashed more force against him than his operational security
    could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie Shrem, battled with financial
    regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous trades are now under pressure
    to make their customers known. Not all companies that rely on a blockchain can
    defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin network itself has survived
    its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can stop this entity. Understanding
    why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part of your education on crypto-assets.Any
    entrepreneur who offers a product or service in a gray area has to prepare for
    battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset ATM providers, over-the-counter
    traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate in this gray area. Are you
    going to operate under a known brand, above the radar? Then your venture needs
    specialized legal advice before you even get started. Your executive team needs
    to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative is to keep your activities
    so far below the radar that regulators will not bother stopping you. Then you
    take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency without raising
    the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter traders can make
    a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to the law in most jurisdictions,
    they need a money transmitter license and comply with KYC/AML regulations. However,
    because the amounts they trade are either small or below the radar, they are not
    worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue working because, so far, they
    do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing a token without registering
    with the regulator. Some people run a project that is so small that they are willing
    to take the risk of unregulated business, rather than accepting the cost of getting
    permission. In case a startup company wants to sail close to the wind concerning
    rules, again, it is best with an attorney on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin,
    Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by a conflict with a nation-state adversary.
    The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous, and they organized themselves in
    companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum doubt whether it can withstand
    an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs a Silk Road-moment to show
    that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How Much Security Do
    You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional risk. They
    are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms so
    that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.Software is eating the world (Marc Andreessen
    in the Wall Street Journal, Why Software is Eating the World , 2011). For example
    computers connected by the internet have eaten snail mail, newspapers, radio,
    TV, music, and books. Money and the financial industry were immune to that trend
    for a long time. Since the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, all the money in circulation
    depended on central political power. The Bretton Woods System was backed by gold
    but ended in the early 70s when the U.S. stopped exchanging gold for dollars.
    However, the political foundation of currency remained: since then, in almost
    every country, the central bank creates fiat money which is used for payments
    as physical paper or electronic transfers between licensed banks. People trust
    fiat money for payments because of that political backing. Creating money was
    a privilege of sovereign entities: to win trust, the organization needs the political
    power to claim and defend the sole right to print money. Entrepreneurs had no
    reason to look at money and finance as value propositions because that political
    dependence ruled out competition from private entities. Law enforcement authorities
    have and will shut down any company that creates a private digital currency that
    succeeds. There was no sense in undermining the sovereignty of a state, so the
    software industry did not attempt to build products that “eat” money and finance.Shutting
    down a successful cryptocurrency is either impossible or prohibitively expensive.
    Bitcoin has a track record of immunity to political meddling; it is slippery on
    the defense and an indirect threat to any central bank or government that mismanages
    its money supply and public finances. Furthermore, banks are no longer the gatekeepers
    of financial progress. Any startup can offer a financial or payment service on
    top of a cryptocurrency. As the liquidity of cryptocurrencies grows, these new

    decentralized money disappeared when governments and banks founded central banks
    to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce decentralized money, with the
    added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat currency works similarly to
    banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by government debt. A central bank
    buys financial products on the open market, usually government bonds. It pays
    for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of the money is paper cash, but
    most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means that the government bonds
    become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and the created money is a
    liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends this money to private
    banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives fiat money back, it
    can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total supply in circulation.
    Other private regulated banks can also issue money through ‘fractional reserve’.
    They can lend out more money than they receive from the central bank or customers
    because they can expect most of their customers to keep their money in the bank.
    See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and money creation.The system
    of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public. The central bank can only
    circulate money that people trust will hold its value well enough. And ordinary
    banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve. Most of their customers
    keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion of these customers withdraw
    their money at any given time. A bank can maintain that fractional reserve as
    long as their customers trust that they can withdraw their money at any time.
    When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank run . In case a large portion
    of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and the bank does not have enough
    fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations, then that bank needs the central
    bank or the government to act as a lender of last resort. If no more significant
    lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s obligations, then it goes bankrupt.
    It is a sophisticated but centralized system. Crypto enthusiasts work on a future
    where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will
    replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat currency. We can expect
    cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features of the banking sector,
    and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders of magnitude. These new
    companies will share the benefits of this new financial system with their customers,
    which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies empower a slow but deliberate
    run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur who nibbles at
    the power that comes from sovereignty, you have to remember: It is not what you
    do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said that Bitcoin gives us, the users
    of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom. He acknowledged that you would not
    find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but “we can win a major
    battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.”
    (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings of Bitcoin Creator
    Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an essential idea for
    crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory of freedom? Technologies
    that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets, and the removal of friction
    in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said: “Governments are good at cutting
    off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks
    like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test
    was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of drugs,” where decentralized money
    proved resistant to coercion from regulation and law enforcement. People traded
    illegal goods on hidden websites, and they still do. The founder of the Silk Road,
    Ross Ulbright, did get caught because he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed
    off law enforcement agencies so much that they unleashed more force against him
    than his operational security could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie
    Shrem, battled with financial regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous
    trades are now under pressure to make their customers known. Not all companies
    that rely on a blockchain can defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin
    network itself has survived its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can
    stop this entity. Understanding why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part
    of your education on crypto-assets.Any entrepreneur who offers a product or service
    in a gray area has to prepare for battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset
    ATM providers, over-the-counter traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate
    in this gray area. Are you going to operate under a known brand, above the radar?
    Then your venture needs specialized legal advice before you even get started.
    Your executive team needs to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative
    is to keep your activities so far below the radar that regulators will not bother
    stopping you. Then you take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency
    without raising the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter
    traders can make a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to
    the law in most jurisdictions, they need a money transmitter license and comply
    with KYC/AML regulations. However, because the amounts they trade are either small
    or below the radar, they are not worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue
    working because, so far, they do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing
    a token without registering with the regulator. Some people run a project that
    is so small that they are willing to take the risk of unregulated business, rather
    than accepting the cost of getting permission. In case a startup company wants
    to sail close to the wind concerning rules, again, it is best with an attorney
    on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by
    a conflict with a nation-state adversary. The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous,
    and they organized themselves in companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum
    doubt whether it can withstand an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs
    a Silk Road-moment to show that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How
    Much Security Do You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional
    risk. They are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms
    so that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.Shutting down a successful cryptocurrency is
    either impossible or prohibitively expensive. Bitcoin has a track record of immunity
    to political meddling; it is slippery on the defense and an indirect threat to
    any central bank or government that mismanages its money supply and public finances.
    Furthermore, banks are no longer the gatekeepers of financial progress. Any startup
    can offer a financial or payment service on top of a cryptocurrency. As the liquidity
    of cryptocurrencies grows, these new financial services will draw customers away
    from banks and perhaps even insurance companies, investment funds, and other financial
    institutions.A Cryptocurrency is a Virtual JurisdictionThree technical problems
    prevented the issuance of private, decentralized currency: the double-spend problem,
    decentralized consensus, and provably fair issuance of new money. Before the invention
    of cryptocurrencies, these obstacles prevented a guarantee of scarcity, which
    is needed for people to trust an asset as money. The launch of Bitcoin opened
    a new playing field. Private parties can now rely on software for transacting
    and storing value. Digital scarcity gives anyone a choice: you have the option
    to transact with fiat currency on closed corporate networks, or decentralized
    cryptocurrencies and exchanges. That choice will erode the power of banks.A crypto
    entrepreneur has to understand the role of political power in the money system.
    As it is, let us assume that political action is not a standard piece of your
    strategy. To a typical entrepreneur, political action looks like an unrewarding
    game. The type of person who starts a company is unlikely to consider a career
    as a politician, with the exception of established billionaires. On the contrary,
    an up-and-coming entrepreneur believes in free markets, voluntary transactions,
    plus-sum games, open innovation, satisfied customers, and profits earned by fair
    competition. These values have little to do with political action. However, the
    power of fiat money is political, to disrupt it your information technology needs
    the teeth to match and exceed that power.You could say that an immutable blockchain
    is a global, voluntary, virtual jurisdiction. You could also call it a ‘smart
    jurisdiction’ for ‘smart contracts.’ Bitcoin and Ethereum are not in a specific
    place; they function on the internet, as a global and distributed network. On
    a decentralized system, people transact, but their assets do not reside in a particular
    place. The people, when identified, might be subject to a traditional jurisdiction
    or another, but this is new technology, and the way the rules apply is vague,
    new, and most likely not defined. That is an advantage for people who choose to
    take responsibility for all the consequences of their transactions, both good
    and bad. Whatever financial game you are playing, there is no automatic authority
    there. The field is free and open. With the narrow exception of earned income,
    if a regulator has an issue with your transactions, the burden of discovery and
    investigation lies with them. You do not have to ask for permission; instead,
    they have to come to you and explain the rules, should they even bother. For example,
    if international travelers memorize the keys of an undeclared wallet with one
    million dollars worth of cryptocurrency, are they breaking the rule that says
    you must declare cash worth more than ten thousand dollars?Sovereign entities
    at odds with the established banking system already use crypto-assets—to apply
    an idea by Von Clausewitz—as a continuation of politics by other means. If politicians
    in North Korea and Iran achieve their ends using crypto-assets, should not others
    be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we are not used to thinking and acting
    as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility of free currency.Building
    on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire more ‘law’-like capabilities
    and more functionality for fundraising, they can compete with nation-states that
    rely on traditional laws. They become virtual jurisdictions: nation-like entities
    that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs, as agents of these sovereign entities,
    have to practice diplomacy. This territory of freedom has an analogy in the separation
    of church and state, which happened around five centuries ago in some places (Erik
    Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation of Money and State is the New Separation
    of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic church lost exclusive authority over
    its territory of religion, and also lost its jurisdiction over physical area to
    nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states and banks will lose their influence
    over money and finance (Martin van Creveld, The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We
    already have historical examples of decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes
    issued by private banks. That decentralized money disappeared when governments
    and banks founded central banks to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce
    decentralized money, with the added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat
    currency works similarly to banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by
    government debt. A central bank buys financial products on the open market, usually
    government bonds. It pays for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of
    the money is paper cash, but most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means
    that the government bonds become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and
    the created money is a liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends
    this money to private banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives
    fiat money back, it can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total
    supply in circulation. Other private regulated banks can also issue money through
    ‘fractional reserve’. They can lend out more money than they receive from the
    central bank or customers because they can expect most of their customers to keep
    their money in the bank. See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and
    money creation.The system of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public.
    The central bank can only circulate money that people trust will hold its value
    well enough. And ordinary banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve.
    Most of their customers keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion
    of these customers withdraw their money at any given time. A bank can maintain

    be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we are not used to thinking and acting
    as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility of free currency.Building
    on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire more ‘law’-like capabilities
    and more functionality for fundraising, they can compete with nation-states that
    rely on traditional laws. They become virtual jurisdictions: nation-like entities
    that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs, as agents of these sovereign entities,
    have to practice diplomacy. This territory of freedom has an analogy in the separation
    of church and state, which happened around five centuries ago in some places (Erik
    Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation of Money and State is the New Separation
    of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic church lost exclusive authority over
    its territory of religion, and also lost its jurisdiction over physical area to
    nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states and banks will lose their influence
    over money and finance (Martin van Creveld, The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We
    already have historical examples of decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes
    issued by private banks. That decentralized money disappeared when governments
    and banks founded central banks to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce
    decentralized money, with the added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat
    currency works similarly to banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by
    government debt. A central bank buys financial products on the open market, usually
    government bonds. It pays for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of
    the money is paper cash, but most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means
    that the government bonds become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and
    the created money is a liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends
    this money to private banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives
    fiat money back, it can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total
    supply in circulation. Other private regulated banks can also issue money through
    ‘fractional reserve’. They can lend out more money than they receive from the
    central bank or customers because they can expect most of their customers to keep
    their money in the bank. See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and
    money creation.The system of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public.
    The central bank can only circulate money that people trust will hold its value
    well enough. And ordinary banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve.
    Most of their customers keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion
    of these customers withdraw their money at any given time. A bank can maintain
    that fractional reserve as long as their customers trust that they can withdraw
    their money at any time. When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank
    run . In case a large portion of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and
    the bank does not have enough fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations,
    then that bank needs the central bank or the government to act as a lender of
    last resort. If no more significant lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s
    obligations, then it goes bankrupt. It is a sophisticated but centralized system.
    Crypto enthusiasts work on a future where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies
    and smart contracts will replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat
    currency. We can expect cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features
    of the banking sector, and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders
    of magnitude. These new companies will share the benefits of this new financial
    system with their customers, which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies
    empower a slow but deliberate run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs
    an entrepreneur who nibbles at the power that comes from sovereignty, you have
    to remember: It is not what you do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said
    that Bitcoin gives us, the users of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom.
    He acknowledged that you would not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,
    but “we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom
    for several years.” (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings
    of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an
    essential idea for crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory
    of freedom? Technologies that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets,
    and the removal of friction in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said:
    “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks
    like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their
    own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of
    drugs,” where decentralized money proved resistant to coercion from regulation
    and law enforcement. People traded illegal goods on hidden websites, and they
    still do. The founder of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbright, did get caught because
    he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed off law enforcement agencies so
    much that they unleashed more force against him than his operational security
    could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie Shrem, battled with financial
    regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous trades are now under pressure
    to make their customers known. Not all companies that rely on a blockchain can
    defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin network itself has survived
    its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can stop this entity. Understanding
    why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part of your education on crypto-assets.Any
    entrepreneur who offers a product or service in a gray area has to prepare for
    battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset ATM providers, over-the-counter
    traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate in this gray area. Are you
    going to operate under a known brand, above the radar? Then your venture needs
    specialized legal advice before you even get started. Your executive team needs
    to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative is to keep your activities
    so far below the radar that regulators will not bother stopping you. Then you
    take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency without raising
    the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter traders can make
    a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to the law in most jurisdictions,
    they need a money transmitter license and comply with KYC/AML regulations. However,
    because the amounts they trade are either small or below the radar, they are not
    worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue working because, so far, they
    do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing a token without registering
    with the regulator. Some people run a project that is so small that they are willing
    to take the risk of unregulated business, rather than accepting the cost of getting
    permission. In case a startup company wants to sail close to the wind concerning
    rules, again, it is best with an attorney on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin,
    Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by a conflict with a nation-state adversary.
    The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous, and they organized themselves in
    companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum doubt whether it can withstand
    an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs a Silk Road-moment to show
    that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How Much Security Do
    You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional risk. They
    are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms so
    that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.Three technical problems prevented the issuance
    of private, decentralized currency: the double-spend problem, decentralized consensus,
    and provably fair issuance of new money. Before the invention of cryptocurrencies,
    these obstacles prevented a guarantee of scarcity, which is needed for people
    to trust an asset as money. The launch of Bitcoin opened a new playing field.
    Private parties can now rely on software for transacting and storing value. Digital
    scarcity gives anyone a choice: you have the option to transact with fiat currency
    on closed corporate networks, or decentralized cryptocurrencies and exchanges.
    That choice will erode the power of banks.A crypto entrepreneur has to understand
    the role of political power in the money system. As it is, let us assume that
    political action is not a standard piece of your strategy. To a typical entrepreneur,
    political action looks like an unrewarding game. The type of person who starts
    a company is unlikely to consider a career as a politician, with the exception
    of established billionaires. On the contrary, an up-and-coming entrepreneur believes
    in free markets, voluntary transactions, plus-sum games, open innovation, satisfied
    customers, and profits earned by fair competition. These values have little to
    do with political action. However, the power of fiat money is political, to disrupt
    it your information technology needs the teeth to match and exceed that power.You
    could say that an immutable blockchain is a global, voluntary, virtual jurisdiction.
    You could also call it a ‘smart jurisdiction’ for ‘smart contracts.’ Bitcoin and
    Ethereum are not in a specific place; they function on the internet, as a global
    and distributed network. On a decentralized system, people transact, but their
    assets do not reside in a particular place. The people, when identified, might
    be subject to a traditional jurisdiction or another, but this is new technology,
    and the way the rules apply is vague, new, and most likely not defined. That is
    an advantage for people who choose to take responsibility for all the consequences
    of their transactions, both good and bad. Whatever financial game you are playing,
    there is no automatic authority there. The field is free and open. With the narrow
    exception of earned income, if a regulator has an issue with your transactions,
    the burden of discovery and investigation lies with them. You do not have to ask
    for permission; instead, they have to come to you and explain the rules, should
    they even bother. For example, if international travelers memorize the keys of
    an undeclared wallet with one million dollars worth of cryptocurrency, are they
    breaking the rule that says you must declare cash worth more than ten thousand
    dollars?Sovereign entities at odds with the established banking system already
    use crypto-assets—to apply an idea by Von Clausewitz—as a continuation of politics
    by other means. If politicians in North Korea and Iran achieve their ends using
    crypto-assets, should not others be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we
    are not used to thinking and acting as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility
    of free currency.Building on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire

    on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire more ‘law’-like capabilities
    and more functionality for fundraising, they can compete with nation-states that
    rely on traditional laws. They become virtual jurisdictions: nation-like entities
    that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs, as agents of these sovereign entities,
    have to practice diplomacy. This territory of freedom has an analogy in the separation
    of church and state, which happened around five centuries ago in some places (Erik
    Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation of Money and State is the New Separation
    of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic church lost exclusive authority over
    its territory of religion, and also lost its jurisdiction over physical area to
    nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states and banks will lose their influence
    over money and finance (Martin van Creveld, The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We
    already have historical examples of decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes
    issued by private banks. That decentralized money disappeared when governments
    and banks founded central banks to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce
    decentralized money, with the added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat
    currency works similarly to banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by
    government debt. A central bank buys financial products on the open market, usually
    government bonds. It pays for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of
    the money is paper cash, but most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means
    that the government bonds become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and
    the created money is a liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends
    this money to private banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives
    fiat money back, it can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total
    supply in circulation. Other private regulated banks can also issue money through
    ‘fractional reserve’. They can lend out more money than they receive from the
    central bank or customers because they can expect most of their customers to keep
    their money in the bank. See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and
    money creation.The system of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public.
    The central bank can only circulate money that people trust will hold its value
    well enough. And ordinary banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve.
    Most of their customers keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion
    of these customers withdraw their money at any given time. A bank can maintain
    that fractional reserve as long as their customers trust that they can withdraw
    their money at any time. When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank
    run . In case a large portion of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and
    the bank does not have enough fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations,
    then that bank needs the central bank or the government to act as a lender of
    last resort. If no more significant lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s
    obligations, then it goes bankrupt. It is a sophisticated but centralized system.
    Crypto enthusiasts work on a future where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies
    and smart contracts will replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat
    currency. We can expect cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features
    of the banking sector, and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders
    of magnitude. These new companies will share the benefits of this new financial
    system with their customers, which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies
    empower a slow but deliberate run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs
    an entrepreneur who nibbles at the power that comes from sovereignty, you have
    to remember: It is not what you do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said
    that Bitcoin gives us, the users of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom.
    He acknowledged that you would not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,
    but “we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom
    for several years.” (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings
    of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an
    essential idea for crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory
    of freedom? Technologies that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets,
    and the removal of friction in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said:
    “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks
    like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their
    own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of
    drugs,” where decentralized money proved resistant to coercion from regulation
    and law enforcement. People traded illegal goods on hidden websites, and they
    still do. The founder of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbright, did get caught because
    he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed off law enforcement agencies so
    much that they unleashed more force against him than his operational security
    could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie Shrem, battled with financial
    regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous trades are now under pressure
    to make their customers known. Not all companies that rely on a blockchain can
    defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin network itself has survived
    its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can stop this entity. Understanding
    why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part of your education on crypto-assets.Any
    entrepreneur who offers a product or service in a gray area has to prepare for
    battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset ATM providers, over-the-counter
    traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate in this gray area. Are you
    going to operate under a known brand, above the radar? Then your venture needs
    specialized legal advice before you even get started. Your executive team needs
    to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative is to keep your activities
    so far below the radar that regulators will not bother stopping you. Then you
    take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency without raising
    the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter traders can make
    a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to the law in most jurisdictions,
    they need a money transmitter license and comply with KYC/AML regulations. However,
    because the amounts they trade are either small or below the radar, they are not
    worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue working because, so far, they
    do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing a token without registering
    with the regulator. Some people run a project that is so small that they are willing
    to take the risk of unregulated business, rather than accepting the cost of getting
    permission. In case a startup company wants to sail close to the wind concerning
    rules, again, it is best with an attorney on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin,
    Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by a conflict with a nation-state adversary.
    The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous, and they organized themselves in
    companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum doubt whether it can withstand
    an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs a Silk Road-moment to show
    that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How Much Security Do
    You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional risk. They
    are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms so
    that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.You could say that an immutable blockchain
    is a global, voluntary, virtual jurisdiction. You could also call it a ‘smart
    jurisdiction’ for ‘smart contracts.’ Bitcoin and Ethereum are not in a specific
    place; they function on the internet, as a global and distributed network. On
    a decentralized system, people transact, but their assets do not reside in a particular
    place. The people, when identified, might be subject to a traditional jurisdiction
    or another, but this is new technology, and the way the rules apply is vague,
    new, and most likely not defined. That is an advantage for people who choose to
    take responsibility for all the consequences of their transactions, both good
    and bad. Whatever financial game you are playing, there is no automatic authority
    there. The field is free and open. With the narrow exception of earned income,
    if a regulator has an issue with your transactions, the burden of discovery and
    investigation lies with them. You do not have to ask for permission; instead,
    they have to come to you and explain the rules, should they even bother. For example,
    if international travelers memorize the keys of an undeclared wallet with one
    million dollars worth of cryptocurrency, are they breaking the rule that says
    you must declare cash worth more than ten thousand dollars?Sovereign entities
    at odds with the established banking system already use crypto-assets—to apply
    an idea by Von Clausewitz—as a continuation of politics by other means. If politicians
    in North Korea and Iran achieve their ends using crypto-assets, should not others
    be able to do it too? As ordinary people, we are not used to thinking and acting
    as sovereigns, but we can be open to the possibility of free currency.Building

    As ordinary people, we are not used to thinking and acting as sovereigns, but
    we can be open to the possibility of free currency.Building on Decentralized MoneyAs
    Bitcoin and Ethereum acquire more ‘law’-like capabilities and more functionality
    for fundraising, they can compete with nation-states that rely on traditional
    laws. They become virtual jurisdictions: nation-like entities that compete with
    nation-states. Entrepreneurs, as agents of these sovereign entities, have to practice
    diplomacy. This territory of freedom has an analogy in the separation of church
    and state, which happened around five centuries ago in some places (Erik Voorhees
    in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation of Money and State is the New Separation of Church
    and State , 2015) The Catholic church lost exclusive authority over its territory
    of religion, and also lost its jurisdiction over physical area to nation-states.
    Likewise, the nation-states and banks will lose their influence over money and
    finance (Martin van Creveld, The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We already
    have historical examples of decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes issued
    by private banks. That decentralized money disappeared when governments and banks
    founded central banks to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce decentralized
    money, with the added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat currency works
    similarly to banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by government debt.
    A central bank buys financial products on the open market, usually government
    bonds. It pays for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of the money is
    paper cash, but most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means that the
    government bonds become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and the created
    money is a liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends this money
    to private banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives fiat money
    back, it can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total supply in circulation.
    Other private regulated banks can also issue money through ‘fractional reserve’.
    They can lend out more money than they receive from the central bank or customers
    because they can expect most of their customers to keep their money in the bank.
    See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and money creation.The system
    of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public. The central bank can only
    circulate money that people trust will hold its value well enough. And ordinary
    banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve. Most of their customers
    keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion of these customers withdraw
    their money at any given time. A bank can maintain that fractional reserve as
    long as their customers trust that they can withdraw their money at any time.
    When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank run . In case a large portion
    of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and the bank does not have enough
    fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations, then that bank needs the central
    bank or the government to act as a lender of last resort. If no more significant
    lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s obligations, then it goes bankrupt.
    It is a sophisticated but centralized system. Crypto enthusiasts work on a future
    where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will
    replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat currency. We can expect
    cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features of the banking sector,
    and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders of magnitude. These new
    companies will share the benefits of this new financial system with their customers,
    which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies empower a slow but deliberate
    run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur who nibbles at
    the power that comes from sovereignty, you have to remember: It is not what you
    do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said that Bitcoin gives us, the users
    of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom. He acknowledged that you would not
    find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but “we can win a major
    battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.”
    (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings of Bitcoin Creator
    Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an essential idea for
    crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory of freedom? Technologies
    that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets, and the removal of friction
    in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said: “Governments are good at cutting
    off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks
    like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test
    was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of drugs,” where decentralized money
    proved resistant to coercion from regulation and law enforcement. People traded
    illegal goods on hidden websites, and they still do. The founder of the Silk Road,
    Ross Ulbright, did get caught because he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed
    off law enforcement agencies so much that they unleashed more force against him
    than his operational security could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie
    Shrem, battled with financial regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous
    trades are now under pressure to make their customers known. Not all companies
    that rely on a blockchain can defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin
    network itself has survived its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can
    stop this entity. Understanding why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part
    of your education on crypto-assets.Any entrepreneur who offers a product or service
    in a gray area has to prepare for battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset
    ATM providers, over-the-counter traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate
    in this gray area. Are you going to operate under a known brand, above the radar?
    Then your venture needs specialized legal advice before you even get started.
    Your executive team needs to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative
    is to keep your activities so far below the radar that regulators will not bother
    stopping you. Then you take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency
    without raising the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter
    traders can make a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to
    the law in most jurisdictions, they need a money transmitter license and comply
    with KYC/AML regulations. However, because the amounts they trade are either small
    or below the radar, they are not worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue
    working because, so far, they do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing
    a token without registering with the regulator. Some people run a project that
    is so small that they are willing to take the risk of unregulated business, rather
    than accepting the cost of getting permission. In case a startup company wants
    to sail close to the wind concerning rules, again, it is best with an attorney
    on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by
    a conflict with a nation-state adversary. The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous,
    and they organized themselves in companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum
    doubt whether it can withstand an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs
    a Silk Road-moment to show that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How
    Much Security Do You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional
    risk. They are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms
    so that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.Building on Decentralized MoneyAs Bitcoin and
    Ethereum acquire more ‘law’-like capabilities and more functionality for fundraising,
    they can compete with nation-states that rely on traditional laws. They become
    virtual jurisdictions: nation-like entities that compete with nation-states. Entrepreneurs,
    as agents of these sovereign entities, have to practice diplomacy. This territory
    of freedom has an analogy in the separation of church and state, which happened
    around five centuries ago in some places (Erik Voorhees in Bitcoin Magazine, Separation
    of Money and State is the New Separation of Church and State , 2015) The Catholic
    church lost exclusive authority over its territory of religion, and also lost
    its jurisdiction over physical area to nation-states. Likewise, the nation-states
    and banks will lose their influence over money and finance (Martin van Creveld,
    The Rise and Fall of the State , 1999).We already have historical examples of
    decentralized money: gold, silver, and banknotes issued by private banks. That
    decentralized money disappeared when governments and banks founded central banks
    to issue money. Cryptocurrency will reintroduce decentralized money, with the
    added benefit of near-instant global payments.Fiat currency works similarly to
    banknotes from private banks, but it is backed by government debt. A central bank
    buys financial products on the open market, usually government bonds. It pays
    for these bonds with money that it creates. Some of the money is paper cash, but
    most of it is numbers on a balance sheet. That means that the government bonds
    become assets on the central bank’s balance sheet, and the created money is a
    liability on their balance sheet. The central bank lends this money to private
    banks at interest. When it sells the bonds, and it receives fiat money back, it
    can destroy that money. That is how it controls the total supply in circulation.
    Other private regulated banks can also issue money through ‘fractional reserve’.
    They can lend out more money than they receive from the central bank or customers
    because they can expect most of their customers to keep their money in the bank.
    See Investopedia for more detail on central banking and money creation.The system
    of fiat currency relies on the trust of the public. The central bank can only
    circulate money that people trust will hold its value well enough. And ordinary
    banks make loans while keeping a fraction in reserve. Most of their customers
    keep their money in the bank, and only a small portion of these customers withdraw
    their money at any given time. A bank can maintain that fractional reserve as
    long as their customers trust that they can withdraw their money at any time.
    When that trust breaks down, you get a so-called bank run . In case a large portion
    of the customers attempts to withdraw money, and the bank does not have enough
    fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations, then that bank needs the central
    bank or the government to act as a lender of last resort. If no more significant
    lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s obligations, then it goes bankrupt.
    It is a sophisticated but centralized system. Crypto enthusiasts work on a future
    where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will
    replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat currency. We can expect
    cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features of the banking sector,
    and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders of magnitude. These new
    companies will share the benefits of this new financial system with their customers,
    which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies empower a slow but deliberate
    run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur who nibbles at

    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.We already have historical examples of decentralized
    money: gold, silver, and banknotes issued by private banks. That decentralized
    money disappeared when governments and banks founded central banks to issue money.
    Cryptocurrency will reintroduce decentralized money, with the added benefit of
    near-instant global payments.Fiat currency works similarly to banknotes from private
    banks, but it is backed by government debt. A central bank buys financial products
    on the open market, usually government bonds. It pays for these bonds with money
    that it creates. Some of the money is paper cash, but most of it is numbers on
    a balance sheet. That means that the government bonds become assets on the central
    bank’s balance sheet, and the created money is a liability on their balance sheet.
    The central bank lends this money to private banks at interest. When it sells
    the bonds, and it receives fiat money back, it can destroy that money. That is
    how it controls the total supply in circulation. Other private regulated banks
    can also issue money through ‘fractional reserve’. They can lend out more money
    than they receive from the central bank or customers because they can expect most
    of their customers to keep their money in the bank. See Investopedia for more
    detail on central banking and money creation.The system of fiat currency relies
    on the trust of the public. The central bank can only circulate money that people
    trust will hold its value well enough. And ordinary banks make loans while keeping
    a fraction in reserve. Most of their customers keep their money in the bank, and
    only a small portion of these customers withdraw their money at any given time.
    A bank can maintain that fractional reserve as long as their customers trust that
    they can withdraw their money at any time. When that trust breaks down, you get
    a so-called bank run . In case a large portion of the customers attempts to withdraw
    money, and the bank does not have enough fiat cash on hand to fulfill those obligations,
    then that bank needs the central bank or the government to act as a lender of
    last resort. If no more significant lender is available to cover the ‘run’ bank’s
    obligations, then it goes bankrupt. It is a sophisticated but centralized system.
    Crypto enthusiasts work on a future where banks are no longer necessary. Cryptocurrencies
    and smart contracts will replace banks, especially central banks who create fiat
    currency. We can expect cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets to inherit the features
    of the banking sector, and then we can see a boost of global finance by orders
    of magnitude. These new companies will share the benefits of this new financial
    system with their customers, which will eventually include everyone. Cryptocurrencies
    empower a slow but deliberate run on all the banks.The Territory of FreedomAs
    an entrepreneur who nibbles at the power that comes from sovereignty, you have
    to remember: It is not what you do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said
    that Bitcoin gives us, the users of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom.
    He acknowledged that you would not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,
    but “we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom
    for several years.” (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings
    of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an
    essential idea for crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory
    of freedom? Technologies that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets,
    and the removal of friction in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said:
    “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks
    like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their
    own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of
    drugs,” where decentralized money proved resistant to coercion from regulation
    and law enforcement. People traded illegal goods on hidden websites, and they
    still do. The founder of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbright, did get caught because
    he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed off law enforcement agencies so
    much that they unleashed more force against him than his operational security
    could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie Shrem, battled with financial
    regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous trades are now under pressure
    to make their customers known. Not all companies that rely on a blockchain can
    defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin network itself has survived
    its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can stop this entity. Understanding
    why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part of your education on crypto-assets.Any
    entrepreneur who offers a product or service in a gray area has to prepare for
    battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset ATM providers, over-the-counter
    traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate in this gray area. Are you
    going to operate under a known brand, above the radar? Then your venture needs
    specialized legal advice before you even get started. Your executive team needs
    to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative is to keep your activities
    so far below the radar that regulators will not bother stopping you. Then you
    take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency without raising
    the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter traders can make
    a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to the law in most jurisdictions,
    they need a money transmitter license and comply with KYC/AML regulations. However,
    because the amounts they trade are either small or below the radar, they are not
    worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue working because, so far, they
    do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing a token without registering
    with the regulator. Some people run a project that is so small that they are willing
    to take the risk of unregulated business, rather than accepting the cost of getting
    permission. In case a startup company wants to sail close to the wind concerning
    rules, again, it is best with an attorney on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin,
    Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by a conflict with a nation-state adversary.
    The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous, and they organized themselves in
    companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum doubt whether it can withstand
    an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs a Silk Road-moment to show
    that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How Much Security Do
    You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional risk. They
    are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms so
    that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network

    they need a money transmitter license and comply with KYC/AML regulations. However,
    because the amounts they trade are either small or below the radar, they are not
    worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue working because, so far, they
    do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing a token without registering
    with the regulator. Some people run a project that is so small that they are willing
    to take the risk of unregulated business, rather than accepting the cost of getting
    permission. In case a startup company wants to sail close to the wind concerning
    rules, again, it is best with an attorney on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin,
    Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by a conflict with a nation-state adversary.
    The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous, and they organized themselves in
    companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum doubt whether it can withstand
    an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs a Silk Road-moment to show
    that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How Much Security Do
    You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional risk. They
    are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms so
    that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.The Territory of FreedomAs an entrepreneur
    who nibbles at the power that comes from sovereignty, you have to remember: It
    is not what you do; it is who you piss off. Satoshi Nakamoto said that Bitcoin
    gives us, the users of cryptocurrency, a “few years” of freedom. He acknowledged
    that you would not find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but
    “we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom
    for several years.” (Phil Champagne, The Book of Satoshi: The Collected Writings
    of Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto , 2014) This “territory of freedom” is an
    essential idea for crypto entrepreneurs. Which technologies expand this territory
    of freedom? Technologies that support privacy, the interchangeability of assets,
    and the removal of friction in communications or transactions. As Satoshi said:
    “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks
    like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their
    own.”Bitcoin’s first freedom test was the operation of Silk Road, “the eBay of
    drugs,” where decentralized money proved resistant to coercion from regulation
    and law enforcement. People traded illegal goods on hidden websites, and they
    still do. The founder of the Silk Road, Ross Ulbright, did get caught because
    he bit off more than he could chew. He pissed off law enforcement agencies so
    much that they unleashed more force against him than his operational security
    could handle. Other early Bitcoiners, such as Charlie Shrem, battled with financial
    regulators. Exchanges that used to host anonymous trades are now under pressure
    to make their customers known. Not all companies that rely on a blockchain can
    defend the freedom it affords. However, the Bitcoin network itself has survived
    its trial by fire. So far, it seems that no one can stop this entity. Understanding
    why Bitcoin is uncensorable is an important part of your education on crypto-assets.Any
    entrepreneur who offers a product or service in a gray area has to prepare for
    battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset ATM providers, over-the-counter
    traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate in this gray area. Are you
    going to operate under a known brand, above the radar? Then your venture needs
    specialized legal advice before you even get started. Your executive team needs
    to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative is to keep your activities
    so far below the radar that regulators will not bother stopping you. Then you
    take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency without raising
    the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter traders can make
    a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to the law in most jurisdictions,
    they need a money transmitter license and comply with KYC/AML regulations. However,
    because the amounts they trade are either small or below the radar, they are not

    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can
    open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if the prize is parked under a
    streetlight in an open space, then the thief will not get that opportunity. A
    bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with a $30 lock, but only when
    secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence. Some bikes are so rusty
    that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions, authorities punish vehicle
    theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without an additional lock.Each
    piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later, the owner becomes familiar
    with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely apply that logic to your
    digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital locks and keys to protect
    against thieves with digital tools. We will look at the specifics of digital wallet
    security in a later chapter. For now, we consider that securing information is,
    at the foundation, the same as securing physical objects.The up-and-coming wave
    of crypto companies will contribute to the translation of physical security concepts
    into the digital sphere. Once that translation is complete, crypto-assets will
    have all the advantages of being digital, yet none of the drawbacks. At that point,
    they will be part of ordinary life as trusted utilities in the background that
    we use without much effort. The crypto-assets secured by cryptography, running
    on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge as a new normal that promotes
    a redistribution of power from central actors into broad communities of peers.
    The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started on the internet are going
    into third gear with crypto-assets.Any entrepreneur who offers a product or service
    in a gray area has to prepare for battles with regulators. Exchanges, crypto-asset
    ATM providers, over-the-counter traders, and issuers of tokenized assets all operate
    in this gray area. Are you going to operate under a known brand, above the radar?
    Then your venture needs specialized legal advice before you even get started.
    Your executive team needs to include an attorney with skin in the game. An alternative
    is to keep your activities so far below the radar that regulators will not bother
    stopping you. Then you take advantage of the innovation made possible by cryptocurrency
    without raising the risk. For example, small but professional over-the-counter
    traders can make a living holding an inventory of crypto-assets. According to
    the law in most jurisdictions, they need a money transmitter license and comply
    with KYC/AML regulations. However, because the amounts they trade are either small
    or below the radar, they are not worth the trouble for regulators. They can continue
    working because, so far, they do not piss anyone off.Another example is issuing
    a token without registering with the regulator. Some people run a project that
    is so small that they are willing to take the risk of unregulated business, rather
    than accepting the cost of getting permission. In case a startup company wants
    to sail close to the wind concerning rules, again, it is best with an attorney
    on the team.In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum has not yet been battle-tested by
    a conflict with a nation-state adversary. The founders of Ethereum are not pseudonymous,
    and they organized themselves in companies and foundations. Critics of Ethereum
    doubt whether it can withstand an attack from a nation-state actor. Ethereum needs
    a Silk Road-moment to show that it can resist regulators and law enforcement agencies.How
    Much Security Do You Need?Blockchains that are smaller than Ethereum face additional
    risk. They are secured by less proof-of-work mining, or experimental mining algorithms
    so that ordinary hackers can attempt so-called double-spend attacks, which undermine
    the trust of the user in the victimized blockchain. Also, these projects have
    fewer developers inspecting the code for bugs and exploits. An immutable and secure
    blockchain is expensive on multiple levels: energy invested for proof-of-work
    mining, open-source leadership and management, and attracting new developers and
    entrepreneurs to the ecosystem. It seems that a blockchain needs to grow big and
    stay on top to be immutable and safe.The creators of Bitcoin designed the network
    for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state actors; the security
    of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards in finance, Bitcoin
    is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game theory of mining,
    buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if the price of Bitcoin
    rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more miners. Each new mining
    rig invests more electric energy in the security of the chain. Although some people
    call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful, we can view Bitcoin as
    a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into financial security.Ethereum’s
    level of security is still an open question because its use of proof-of-work mining
    is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work a temporary solution while
    they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does not cost electricity or
    hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks of transactions. As mentioned
    in the previous section, another vulnerability is the public nature of the organization
    that develops Ethereum. The development team is organized in a foundation and
    seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin. The legible organization could face
    pressure from regulators or politicians. Even though the nodes that run the network
    stay independent, some actors could pressure the team into building features and
    backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through censorship, that will validate
    the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has a fixed issuance policy, a future
    dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized foundation. Ethereum Classic would
    then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’ smart contract, resistant to
    powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might fail under the pressure of a
    nation-state attack, it could still have enough security to support a set of less
    significant financial applications. Non-controversial companies could still rely
    on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators might not bother to apply
    pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup can account for the means
    and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection from those threats. Another
    category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require even less resistance to censorship.
    Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers that be, only need settlement
    assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum and other blockchains can do
    that better than middlemen or institutions. There is no need to over-secure every
    blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests a future with multiple blockchains.The
    security of assets depends on costs, risks, and rewards. We get hold of things
    we value and keep them secure. Whether these things are material or intangible,
    these costs and risks are physical. The challenge is to find the right security
    solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple metal lock. People who often
    ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp of the lock their two-wheeler
    needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle of a high-end brand needs a
    lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with a diamond-cutting tool can

    complete, crypto-assets will have all the advantages of being digital, yet none
    of the drawbacks. At that point, they will be part of ordinary life as trusted
    utilities in the background that we use without much effort. The crypto-assets
    secured by cryptography, running on a blockchain-based virtual jurisdiction, emerge
    as a new normal that promotes a redistribution of power from central actors into
    broad communities of peers. The decentralizing and fragmenting forces that started
    on the internet are going into third gear with crypto-assets.The creators of Bitcoin
    designed the network for a purpose that they expected would piss off nation-state
    actors; the security of proof-of-work mining matches that threat. By many standards
    in finance, Bitcoin is the most secure way of moving and storing money. The game
    theory of mining, buying, and selling keeps the cost of security accurate: if
    the price of Bitcoin rises, mining becomes more profitable, which attracts more
    miners. Each new mining rig invests more electric energy in the security of the
    chain. Although some people call this proof-of-work security inelegant and wasteful,
    we can view Bitcoin as a fair marketplace that transforms electrical energy into
    financial security.Ethereum’s level of security is still an open question because
    its use of proof-of-work mining is reluctant. The leadership considers proof-of-work
    a temporary solution while they develop a secure proof-of-stake model, which does
    not cost electricity or hardware but allows owners to earn fees by making blocks
    of transactions. As mentioned in the previous section, another vulnerability is
    the public nature of the organization that develops Ethereum. The development
    team is organized in a foundation and seems more hierarchical than that of Bitcoin.
    The legible organization could face pressure from regulators or politicians. Even
    though the nodes that run the network stay independent, some actors could pressure
    the team into building features and backdoors they want. If Ethereum fails through
    censorship, that will validate the proposition of Ethereum Classic, which has
    a fixed issuance policy, a future dedication to proof-of-work, and no centralized
    foundation. Ethereum Classic would then attract those startups that need a ‘naughty’
    smart contract, resistant to powerful would-be censors.Although Ethereum might
    fail under the pressure of a nation-state attack, it could still have enough security
    to support a set of less significant financial applications. Non-controversial
    companies could still rely on Ethereum’s blockchain. Governments and regulators
    might not bother to apply pressure to prevent these smaller disruptions. A startup
    can account for the means and motives of its adversaries, and seek protection
    from those threats. Another category of crypto-assets, gaming assets, require
    even less resistance to censorship. Ordinary assets, which do not offend the powers
    that be, only need settlement assurances for the transacting parties. Ethereum
    and other blockchains can do that better than middlemen or institutions. There
    is no need to over-secure every blockchain asset against censorship, which suggests
    a future with multiple blockchains.The security of assets depends on costs, risks,
    and rewards. We get hold of things we value and keep them secure. Whether these
    things are material or intangible, these costs and risks are physical. The challenge
    is to find the right security solution for each of our valuables. Consider a simple
    metal lock. People who often ride a bicycle or motorcycle have an intuitive grasp
    of the lock their two-wheeler needs. In most cities, a new or classic motorcycle
    of a high-end brand needs a lock worth at least $100\. A determined thief with
    a diamond-cutting tool can open that lock in ten minutes or less; however, if
    the prize is parked under a streetlight in an open space, then the thief will
    not get that opportunity. A bicycle with a price tag of $200 is usually safe with
    a $30 lock, but only when secured to a hard point such as a lamp post or fence.
    Some bikes are so rusty that they are not worth stealing. In some jurisdictions,
    authorities punish vehicle theft harshly, so that you can park a motorbike without
    an additional lock.Each piece of property has a threat model, and sooner or later,
    the owner becomes familiar with it. To keep your crypto-assets secure, you merely
    apply that logic to your digital environment as well. Digital assets have digital
    locks and keys to protect against thieves with digital tools. We will look at
    the specifics of digital wallet security in a later chapter. For now, we consider
    that securing information is, at the foundation, the same as securing physical
    objects.The up-and-coming wave of crypto companies will contribute to the translation
    of physical security concepts into the digital sphere. Once that translation is
