- en: The study aims at investigating the potential use of blockchain technology in
    procurement processes. To better understand how the procurement process works,
    the case study of Eni is analyzed. Eni seeks to decarburize all its products by
    2050, and its fight towards the energy transition is committed to working with
    suppliers ready to support it in this vision. After understanding the procurement
    process within Eni and identifying the potential uses of blockchain within these
    processes, the chapter proves that blockchain could be a powerful tool for the
    procurement process, especially for supplier qualification.

- en: The energy transition has been trending over recent years all over the world
    and particularly in Europe, fast-tracking the fusion of many technologies and
    shaping the new industrial environment (De Giovanni, 2021a). The energy sector
    is of the highest economic importance with a turnover of around EUR 1.9 trillion
    along the supply chain in the EU (Eurostat, 2018). This shows the significant
    impact the sector has on countries’ GDPs and how efficient the transition process
    should be to avoid massive capital and job losses.

    pledged in their 2030 framework on climate and energy to move gradually green
    (EEA, 2019), many companies in the energy sector have set up a clear roadmap,
    implemented many projects in different world regions and incorporated the 17 United
    Nations 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to comply with
    the new related regulations that are being implemented.

    criteria in line with sustainability. A careful selection and evaluation of suppliers
    are the initial steps to ensure the sustainability of supply chains (Wenyan S.,
    2017). This endeavor is carried out by the procurement department, which includes
    procuring goods, raw materials, services, infrastructure, and maintenance in exchange
    for financial assets (Preeker and De Giovanni, 2018). It is part of the upstream
    supply chain that has the most profound influence on the overall supply chain
    and can affect its resilience (Sarkis J., 2019). Green procurement, however, consists
    of considering environmental sustainability practices in the most traditional
    procurement activities, from supplier selection to equipment or service delivery
    (De Giovanni and Cariola, 2020).

    dedicated to public procurement simply because a robust procurement system fosters
    development and brings economic growth to a country (Sanchez, 2019). Following
    the same trend, procurement in the private sector represents one of the most significant
    expenses. A report on best practices in procurement, written by the Aberdeen Group,
    an international marketing company, explained that the procurement of goods and
    services not directly involved in the production processes usually constitutes
    thirty to sixty percent of its total expenditures (Orr, 2002). Being part of the
    upstream supply chain, procurement has a high level of influence on the remaining
    part of the supply chain and, this is true even in terms of sustainability.

    cooperation generally positively affects firm performance across social, green,
    and economic dimensions. It adds that investments in sustainability result in
    sufficient returns (Hollos D., 2012). Therefore, supplier cooperation is one of
    the strategic points that can influence a company’s plans to go green.

    for the long-term success of supply chains (Wenyan S., 2017). The choice of suitable
    suppliers is then made through a qualification process based on the information
    provided by potential suppliers. However, qualifying and evaluating suppliers
    in a sustainability context is a multi-dimensional and complex activity depending
    on information. Indeed, information is critical in improving relationships between
    suppliers. Increased coordination between supply chain actors could reduce risks,
    costs and improve a supply chains’ overall competitiveness (Badzar, 2016).

- en: When environmental information on suppliers is available, the qualification
    and selection of suppliers having high environmental performance can be facilitated
    (Sarkis J., 2019). Unfortunately, this information is not always accessible, and
    when it is, it is not easily certifiable or auditable. Furthermore, in order to
    be awarded lucrative contracts, suppliers tendering for a contract provide information
    on relevant environmental issues not necessarily accurate.

- en: Since supplier qualification in a sustainability context relies on data verification
    or auditable information, organizations must double-check all data provided in
    order to qualify the right supplier in line with the organization’s vision on
    sustainability. They should also implement more transparency in their procurement
    and qualification processes to counteract this imbalance due to asymmetric information
    (Badzar, 2016). For doing so, they have to access, certify and audit information
    available on suppliers. With technological advancements, these procurement practices
    are being revisited because companies are looking to new technologies for help
    (De Giovanni, 2021b). And, currently, one of the best technologies able to handle
    this significant sustainable information limitation barrier is Blockchain.

    the Blockchain can radically change the traditional business models (Laurent Probst,
    2016). In recent years, the Blockchain has attracted much attention from practitioners.
    To date, an increasing number of businesses embrace it since it promises a plethora
    of benefits, including increased transparency, time savings, cost savings, increased
    trust in the system, reduced tampering, reduced human error due to manual processes,
    and others (Torres de Oliveira, 2017). It is an innovative solution, and to date,
    various businesses from all sectors want to benefit from its advantages.

    a public ledger, containing information on every transaction made within a system
    (Bettina Warburg, 2019). It seems to be an up-and-coming solution that could enhance
    transparency, security, speed of work, and privacy (De Giovanni, 2020a). Blockchain
    offers the benefits like traceability, immutability, and security. This new technology,
    the main issues and challenges organizations face in procurement, could find an
    effective and sustainable solution and fix information certification issues (Fin.,
    2020).

    processes; however, most articles discuss the use of the Blockchain in public
    procurement, and just a few discuss the use of the Blockchain in procurement processes
    for sustainability improvement. Some articles also discuss the green supply chain
    or challenges faced by companies willing to move on green procurement (Santosh,
    2019) and how Blockchain can achieve this. Some others discuss information certification
    in the academic, art, and media sectors, but very few articles discuss blockchain
    technology’s use to certify supplier information related to sustainability for
    the procurement process. Therefore, further research is required to fully explore
    how blockchain technology can be used on procurement for sustainability purposes.

    Company - is a private Italian hydrocarbon company founded in 1953 under the presidency
    of Enrico Mattei (Bloomberg). It was privatized in 1998; still, the Italian state
    retains a minority shareholding. It is active in the oil, natural gas, petrochemical,
    power generation, and engineering sectors. It is present in 68 countries and has
    approximately 31,400 employees. Its revenues amounted to 43 billion euros in 2020\.
    Eni’s business model is based on operational excellence, carbon neutrality (2050),
    and alliances for development. Sustainability is an essential part of its business
    and is integrated into all its operations.

    an organization from monitoring its partners’ accurate data and leads to a disaster
    because the risk of making wrong decisions is high. Therefore, while having information
    is one of the main objectives of an organization, a practical, robust validation
    process is crucial to ensure that the given data is reliable. An in-depth analysis
    of the questions asked to the suppliers, the type of information requested by
    Eni, and the procedure followed during the qualification process shows that sustainability
    takes an essential place in Eni processes, so the information and documentation
    provided must be exact and accurate.

    have a significant incentive to conceal practices that may compromise their ability
    to continue to sell their products to their customers (De Giovanni, 2016). In
    the same way, to be awarded lucrative contracts, suppliers participating in the

    and processes. Auditing is a widely used tool for product and process verification.
    The British Standards Institution defines it as a documented and independent process
    and helps obtain proofs of statements of facts and determine to which extent requirements
    or policies, on which are based auditing criteria, are fulfilled (ISO 9001, 2015).
    The auditee’s activities, products, or processes are systematically examined to
    check their conformity to audit criteria. Although the method has proven to be
    effective and is still relevant, it would be costly and time-consuming for Eni
    if it were to audit all potential suppliers in the qualification process.

    party. Certification can be defined as the process through which an accredited
    organization delivers a written certificate with the audit report or a scoring
    system grade, guaranteeing that an organization complies with the requirements
    of a given standard (Global Standard, 2021). Certification companies are third
    parties that work with organizations to issue and check the validity of certificates
    for compliance with environmental regulations. Therefore, a company can refer
    to these accredited certification agencies to verify the authenticity of the information
    or documents provided by its partners. The method is also practical since accredited
    certification agencies are reliable; still, current methods for certifying and
    validating documents depend on third parties, generally requiring longer processing
    times, a lot of man work, phone calls, and emails (Trong, 2018).
