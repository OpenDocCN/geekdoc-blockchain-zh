- en: DigiByte is the blockchain that is owning the gaming space. It’s a unique system
    that works well with many interesting applications, from gaming to document management.
    The team at DigiByte has discovered the right mix of speed, accessibility, and
    utility for blockchains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One unique aspect of DigiByte is the five separate algorithms, each of which
    averages 20 percent of new blocks. This is a big deal because most blockchains
    are running on just one algorithm, and only the fastest nodes win tokens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of the five DigiByte algorithms accommodates a different type of miner,
    which has made the DigiByte protocol appealing to more users and increased decentralization.
    Because of this protocol’s approach, attackers would need to gain control of around
    60 percent of the total network hash rate to cause any problems. This would entail
    control of at least 93 percent of one algorithm and 51 percent of the other four
    (as compared to Bitcoin, which is running one algorithm and is subject to a 51
    percent attack). The 51 percent attack concept is one of the greatest weakness
    of the Bitcoin blockchain. If more than 51 percent of the miners in the Bitcoin
    network are controlled by one group, they can manipulate the Bitcoin blockchain.
    If the network is compromised, the token will lose its value and the data secured
    within the network will be compromised.

- en: DigiByte, also known as the cryptocurrency DGB, is a blockchain that is focused
    on gaming, payments, and security. The company is headquartered in Hong Kong and
    was founded by Jared Tate. Tate came from a military and early computer science
    background and was involved in Bitcoin for many years. After becoming frustrated
    in the development of Bitcoin core, he launched DigiByte in 2014 and raised a
    seed round of funding to expand his work in payment and trade.

- en: The DigiByte team has done amazing work that many other projects utilize. Currently,
    DigiByte is processing 300 transactions per second. To put that into perspective,
    Bitcoin does about seven transactions per second. The team has many inspiring
    goals for its project, including match Visa’s staggering transaction speed by
    2021.

- en: DigiByte is one of the most widely distributed networks, with more than 8,000
    nodes in 82 countries. It works similar to Bitcoin in that it can be used to move
    value between two parties quickly and at a very low cost. It also has some of
    the same functionality as Bitcoin in that it can secure a small amount of information
    within its blockchain. Through this mechanism, it allows you to secure data, documents,
    and contracts at an even faster speed than Bitcoin.

    The team offers up prizes for gaming through the platform and tweeting nice things

    within the gaming environment to facilitate a new type of digital advertising.
    It has a growing user base of more than 10,000\. It’s a form of permission marketing,
    where campaigns and incentives drive brand engagement with cryptocurrency prizes
    and bounties. The ability to do secure micropayments that are nearly borderless
    gives this type of marketing platform a very interesting competitive advantage.
  prefs: []

    also lets companies make payments and offer prizes of just about any size to anyone
    in the world. It will be exciting to see DigiByte marketing expand beyond the
    gaming industry.  ## Mining on DigiByte'

- en: DigiByte uses five mining algorithms to process transactions. Each algorithm
    accounts for 20 percent of all blocks created on the network. This system makes
    DigiByte a unique and diverse blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DigiByte team saw that there was greater advantage to gain by allowing more
    types of mining on its platform. In systems that have a single algorithm, only
    the fastest and latest technology will win. This creates a sort of cannibalistic
    arms race for technology and speed. Because it allows all different types of machines
    to successfully win tokens, the DigiByte system is open to greater diversity and
    participation.

- en: The multiplicity of DigiByte’s algorithms incentivizes more individuals to participate
    in mining by lowering the barrier to enter the network successfully. The decentralization
    that resulted from this diversity has attracted many interesting uses for the
    network. Cryptocurrency miners will often repurpose outdated Bitcoin mining equipment
    to use on the DigiByte network where they can still find utility for it.
