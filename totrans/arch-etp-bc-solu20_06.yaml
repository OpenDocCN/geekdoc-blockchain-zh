    engagements and how you as a VAR, IT vendor, or even solutions integrator can
    participate in the blockchain sales cycles. Blockchain solutions selling has a
    heavy focus on application development, compliance, and enterprise integration,
    so a focus on those areas is advisable. However, your organization is already
    likely helping clients in these areas of application development, compliance,
    and enterprise integration successfully, and therefore translating your existing
    skill base should not be difficult with the proper focused training of how blockchains
    provide value and can integrate with the organization.

    for enterprise IT hardware, software, and professional services. In some scenarios,
    the process of selling blockchain solutions is more straightforward than for traditional
    IT solutions. This is because of the significant lack of valid production blockchain
    options, especially in the financial sectors.

    blockchain technology or not, your main goal should be to provide value to your

    group. Developers are different in the way they think than your typical network
    engineer, for example. They are detailed, clearly identify with coding languages,
    use specific jargon, and like to solve problems. Developers are also going to
    be the one group of stakeholders who know how an application works from start
    to finish. They understand the runtime environments, the database structures,
    integration with the endpoint services, and the logging for compliance, for example.
    When presenting to the development stakeholders, you'll need to present a technical
    discussion, so you are well advised to bring talent who can discuss areas of focus.
    These areas include application programming interfaces (APIs) such as REST or
    Open APIs; development languages such as Go, Java, and Node; and integration options
    for distributed business applications that may run on smart contracts such as

    (BaaS) with a basic configuration to address the customer interests and provide
    value around reducing “pain points.” For example, if the demo is about Hyperledger
    Fabric and you're running this in IBM Bluemix, you're basically ready to go. If
    the customer base is made up of developers, I walk them through how to deploy
    chaincode (smart contracts). On the other hand, if the customer base involved
    is more executive level, then I want to focus on creating efficiency, showing
    the ease of use, and discussing any ROI/TCO savings that could be accomplished
    with the solution.

    with at one time or another to help identify the specific performance, security,

    a solutions feasibility. It's a demonstration process in principle that is usually
    a “visual” process for the customer to establish that the solution could work.
    This section contains my best practices with POCs.
  id: totrans-132
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, when I am performing a proof of concept, the critical thing I do is to
    discuss with the sales team that the customer has been vetted and has a procurement
    viability. (Has the customer been vetted financially?) As a best practice, your
    organization's account executives (AEs) should be vetting the proper leads and
    then following up with appropriate stakeholders to ensure that a POC is a valid
    and proper exercise for both the customer and the sales organization. From my
    experience, it's a wise decision to question the AE about customer validation
    to ensure that a POC is in the company's best interest from technical and business
    perspectives. It's one thing to perform a packaged 30-minute demo remotely, but
    it's a totally different situation to spend a weekend setting up for a specific
    use case and two days on-site. You as an engineer are fully responsible for your
    time and should want to ensure you're not “fishing in a dead lake.”
  id: totrans-133
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, I request that the customer and the sales team work directly with me
    to establish clear “success criteria” for the POC. This can be done via a conference
    call, for example, before going on-site. The POC must be clearly defined for you
    as an engineer; you must be able to state the goals and the desired results that
    are the success criteria. You can get in your car and drive aimlessly, or you
    can get in your car and have a destination. It's your choice to control the POC
    you're running, and I suggest you're clearly identified as the driver.
  id: totrans-134
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, I like to confirm with the sales executive that they have commitment
    from the customer that if we deliver on the success criteria, we will win the
    procurement. If the expectation is not set correctly with the customer, then it
    shows the sales team is weak, and you as an engineer may very well be involved
    in another exercise in futility.

    Lastly, resiliency is focused on how the blockchain platform will be available
    if a network node goes down and is sometimes compared to availability. For example,
    if your proposed blockchain solution is using Hyperledger Fabric and your design
    is using eight nodes/peers in a New Jersey data center, your deployment is very
    local with no geographic resiliency. What happens if the power grid goes down?

    but is not performing with lower transactions per second because of the additional
    induced network latency.

    decision on whether your use case would benefit from a blockchain. One of the
    main things I like about the IEEE decision tree is that it starts by asking whether
    traditional database technology meets your needs. This question really will filter
    the requirements remarkably easily. One of the challenges that you may also run
    into is that the blockchain industry is trying to make it seem that blockchains
    are the solution to every problem by using, a “hammer in search of a nail where
    every problem is made into a nail.” Reality is that if the customer does prefer
    or requires, for example, high transactions processing (over 1000 TPS), then you
    just ruled out a blockchain. On the other hand, if privacy, security, and compliance
    are the main concerns, then you may very well have a potential blockchain application
    use case.

    application and the customer relationship need to be supported and maintained.
    Generally, most of these responsibilities are turned over to the customer. However,
    your developers and engineers may very well need to be engaged when challenges
    arise, especially during a POC. For example, with R3 Corda there are two options
    to deploying Corda. The options are the open source version and the enterprise
    version. Generally, during a POC you''re supporting the customer and not the vendor,
    which is Corda. When the customer moves to Corda Enterprise, the support, updates,
    and customer management are handled directly by Corda.  ## Summary'

    how VARs, vendors, and integrators can participate in the blockchain sales cycle.
    Selling blockchain solutions requires a significant interaction with the development
    group. There are numerous roles around blockchain specialization, such as blockchain
    architects, blockchain marketers, blockchain developers, and sales engineers,

- en: Blockchains just like other IT solutions have specific tasks during the sales
    process that you will need to perform or participate in such as requests for proposals
    (RFPs), demos, and proof of concepts (POCs). Blockchain technology has specific
    benefits, such as providing transparency, provenance, and immutability, but also
    specific challenges to its adoption. Discussions with prospective customers and
    clients will be focused on technical requirements for IT networking, blockchain,
    and computer programming. Becoming a trusted advisor by establishing credibility
    with the customer base revolves around knowing your customer's business requirements
    as well as their business challenges—which can make all the difference in your
    success. Lastly, I discussed specific blockchain core competencies such as training,
    solutions design, application development, and best practices.
