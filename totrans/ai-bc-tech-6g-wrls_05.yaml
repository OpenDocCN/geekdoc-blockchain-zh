- en: In the coming era, 6G is expected to bring a new reality that contains billions
    of things, humans, connected cars, robots and drones that will produce Zettabytes
    of digital data. 6G is mainly used to design an inclusive digital and physical
    environment, which is able to sense it, understand it and programme it. Several
    countries around the world are competing to own 6G infrastructures and solutions
    since this new technology provides huge capabilities that will reshape how enterprises
    operate. Although 6G provides several advantages over existing technologies, security
    and privacy issues still need to be addressed. This is because 6G provides automatization
    of most critical processes, which produce a more wide and complex attack surface.
    Also, with 6G, the network becomes more vulnerable not only to direct security
    attacks but also to misbehaviour of automated processes that require to be recognized,
    and their effect should be minimized. This chapter provides a discussion of security
    and privacy issues in 6G and how the integration of blockchain and Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) with 6G can provide possible solutions to overcome these issues.
    The chapter starts by providing an overview of wireless communications technologies
    from 0 to 6G. This is followed by discussing the main security and privacy issues
    in 6G networks. Then, the integration of blockchain with 6G will be discussed
    by highlighting possible solutions to overcome security and privacy issues associated
    with 6G. The integration of 6G with AI will be also discussed by highlighting
    the importance of AI in 6G and how AI with 6G can provide better and effective
    security and privacy solutions. In the end, healthcare with 6G is presented as
    a use case by highlighting security issues and discussing the role of AI and blockchain
    in providing effective security solutions in the healthcare sector.

- en: Although the fifth generation or 5G of mobile communication network is not fully
    implemented, several studies started to talk about 6G (Sixth Generation) and its
    potentials. 6G is anticipated to enable unprecedented Internet of Everything (IoE)
    applications with enormously varied and challenging demands. 6G is intended as
    a space-aerial-terrestrial-ocean interconnected three-dimension network with multiple
    sorts of parts enabled by new technologies and standards to make the system more
    intelligent and flexible to meet varied requirements efficiently [[1](#CR1)].
    Some people argue that 6G networks will be just a faster version of 5G, but the
    reality is 6G, is a new improved version of 5G in almost all aspects. For instance,
    unlike the 5G network, coverage will not be confined to the ground level. Instead,
    it should cover the entire undersea surface area. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    capabilities also will be substantially higher on the 6G network [[2](#CR2)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 6G provides new attractive characteristics that will integrate capabilities
    of previous mobile communication technologies such as high reliability, massive
    connectivity, high throughput and network densification. 6G can be able to provide
    several benefits to various applications such as autonomous vehicles, sensing,
    implants, computing reality devices, smart wearables, and 3D mapping [[3](#CR3),
    [4](#CR4)]. 6G will also improve performance and maximize user Quality of Service
    (QoS). 6G is predicted to offer 1000 times faster wireless connectivity than 5G.
    Additionally, 6G is projected to enable ultra-long-range communication with a
    latency of less than 1 ms [[5](#CR5)].

- en: Although 6G provides unlimited advantages for various applications due to the
    huge capabilities it provides, security and privacy are the major issues that
    6G need to address. The integration of AI in 6G can be used to develop safer and
    secure systems, but it can also be used to create more dangerous attacks. Physical
    layer security measures can also be used as the first line of defence for safeguarding
    network portions that haven't been thoroughly explored. Therefore, there is a
    need for effective solutions to security and privacy challenges in 6G networks.

- en: Adopting one of the Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) such as blockchain
    is one of the solutions for overcoming security and privacy challenges in 6G.
    Blockchain is distributed, decentralized, and trustless network by eliminating
    the centralized authority. This improves transparency by sharing the transaction
    details between the participants in the network, provides rigorous security to
    prevent cyber-attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) and privacy to protect sensitive
    information and prevent data manipulation [[6](#CR6)]. Blockchain is also capable
    of storing data across the network immutably and securely. This eliminates the
    single point of failure and data manipulation [[7](#CR7)].

    issues in 6G is AI. The integration of AI with 6G will bring several benefits
    for overcoming 6G's security and privacy issues. Multi-layered intrusion detection
    and prevention employing deep reinforcement learning and Deep Neural Networks
    (DNN) can protect 6G against IP spoofing attacks, flow table overloading attacks,
    Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, control plane saturation attacks,
    and host location hijacking attacks. Machine learning (ML) techniques like Decision
    Trees and Random Forest can be also beneficial for detecting DDoS attacks in SDN
    systems because of their speed and accuracy.

- en: The evolution of mobile communication technologies passed through different
    phases. This section provides an overview of these different phases by highlighting
    the main advantages and drawbacks introduced by each generation. The discussion
    started from 0G or pre-cellular mobile telephony in 1970 to 6G that expected to
    be implemented in 2030.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 0G or Zero Generation refers to the pre-cellular mobile telephony technology
    used in the 1970s such as Radio telephones and the telephone in cars, which was
    introduced before the invention of cell phones. 0G utilized technologies including
    IMTS (Improved Mobile Telephone Service), OLT (Norwegian for Offentlig Landmobil
    Telefoni), PTT (Push to Talk), AMTS (Advanced Mobile Telephone System), and MTS
    (Mobile Telephone System) [[8](#CR8)]. Early example that utilized 0G technology
    was Autoradiopuhelin (ARP), which was introduced by Finland in 1971 and become
    the first public commercial mobile phone network. Also, Germany introduced B-NetZ
    in 1972 as a public commercial mobile phone network [[9](#CR9)].

- en: 1G or First-Generation technology for cellular networks was presented in the
    1980s. Nippon Telephone & Telegraph (NTT) in Tokyo, Japan, introduced the world's
    first cellular system in 1979\. Also, Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) and (TACS)
    in 1980 started to introduce their cellular systems across Europe [[8](#CR8)].
    1G was mainly designed for voice services in which it uses analogue signals to
    transmit information [[10](#CR10)]. 1G was the first step in the road to provide
    public and commercial mobile telephony. Although all 1G systems provided handover
    and roaming capability, the interoperability between countries was the major issue
    that faced 1G. This allows users to make voice calls only in one country. Also,
    1G suffered from the lack of security and privacy as voice calls were transmitted
    back to the radio towers, which make these calls susceptible to various attacks.
    Also, since voice calls are not encrypted, the data transmission and calls can
    neither be secure, nor private. 1G also suffered from poor voice links and low
    capacity and unreliable handoff [[11](#CR11)].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2G or Second-Generation technology was introduced in the early 1990s. The first
    2G system was introduced by Finland in 1991\. 2G is mainly based on digital modulation
    techniques, which enable both voice and short message services [[12](#CR12)].
    GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is the most well-known and commonly
    utilized 2G mobile communication system [[13](#CR13)]. GSM overcomes the limitation
    of 1G by allowing international roaming between phone providers, which enable
    users to utilize their phones in different places around the globe. Compared to
    1G, 2G provides better security and privacy since the encryption is applied on
    all text messages, which provide better security and allow only interned receiver
    to obtain messages and read it. Although 2G provides better security over 1G,
    it still has some issues such as crypto flaws, eavesdropping attack, SIM attack,
    fake base station (BS), absence of replay protection and DOS attack.

- en: 3G or Third-Generation technology of mobile communication was first introduced
    in 2000\. It was the first wireless communication technology that enables data
    transfer of 2 Mbps [[14](#CR14)]. 3G provides several advantages over 2G technology
    in which it provides faster communications that enable sending and receiving a
    large amount of data and enable high-speed video conferencing and 3D games. Also,
    with increased bandwidth and broadband capabilities with 3G, this allows web-based
    applications and audio and video streaming to work efficiently. On the other hand,
    3G presents some challenges or drawbacks. One of the major issues is energy efficiency
    in which 3G consumes significantly more power than 2G, so 3G needs different devices
    and drivers. This makes building an infrastructure for 3G more challenging. Also,
    3G needs high bandwidth requirements and costly fees for 3G licenses and agreements
    [[15](#CR15)]. UMTS (universal mobile telecommunications service) or what was
    called W-CDMA is the primacy technology in 3G. It represents the recessive that
    is compatible with prior generations of wireless technologies through its heterogeneity
    with the legacy GSM and AMPS technologies. The evolution of UMTS into high-speed
    packet access (HSPA) and advanced HSPA (HSPA + ) allowed for greater end-to-end
    network efficiency and eventually led to the advancement of the next generation
    of networks [[16](#CR16)].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4G or Fourth-Generation technology of mobile communication was first introduced
    in Stockholm in 2009\. 4G represents the communication standard that delivers
    demands for broadband data transmission and broadcasting. 4G was the main driver
    for the Internet of Things (IoT) that enables users and physical objects to connect
    anytime, anywhere using any network path. 4G is the successor of 3G that is produced
    to overcome limitations associated with 3G and enable broader bandwidth, better
    security and privacy and high-speed internet access. According to the ITU union,
    4G provides a data rate of 100 Mbps [[17](#CR17)]. 4G is mainly based on the invention
    of LTE (Long-Term Evolution), which provides an IP-based invention for data transmission.
    LTE provides seamless mobility, QoS, and low latency for packet-switched traffic.
    4G provides high-speed data rates up to 1Gbps, which provide high quality for
    audio and video streaming applications and online games. 4G also provides better
    security and privacy. On the other hand, 4G introduces some issues in which 4G
    consumes more power and need complicated and expensive hardware for implementation
    [[8](#CR8)].

- en: 5G or Fifth-Generation technology of mobile communication was first introduced
    in the late 2010s. The demands for considerably faster data rates for users, and
    the exponentially growing IoT applications and services have meant the telecom
    industry has had to evolve around these pressures. 5G can satisfy the demands
    of the public and companies by creating a truly mobile and wired connected community.
    This will only be achieved by improving the radio access interface, which requires
    a new larger range of frequency, expanded bandwidth for the increasing user base,
    and support for the ever-expanding IoT [[18](#CR18)]. There are various advantages
    to 5G. It transports a world with much improved mobile data broadband, ultra-responsiveness,
    ultra-reliability, ultra-low latency, ultra-fast data rates, and huge IoT capabilities.
    5G can support around one million per square kilometre while 4G can only support
    about 4,000 devices. This can enable more video and audio streaming without disruption.
    Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) is a new digital technique used
    in 5G that uses multiple targeted beams to highlight and follow users throughout
    a cell site. Coverage, speed, and capacity are all improved as a result [[19](#CR19)].
    5G is extremely compatible with WWWW (Wireless World Wide Web), which will create
    several applications using the high capabilities it provides.

    of several researchers, although 5G coverage is not yet being provided completely.
    The research has been started in 2019 to develop the 6G wireless technology. 6G
    provides new attractive characteristics that will integrate capabilities of previous
    mobile communication technologies such as high reliability, massive connectivity,
    high throughput and network densification. 6G with new capabilities will be able
    to provide several benefits to various applications such as AI, smart wearables,
    implants, autonomous vehicles, computing reality devices, sensing, and 3D mapping
    [[3](#CR3), [4](#CR4)]. 6G will improve performance and maximize user QoS. 6G
    is predicted to offer 1000 times faster wireless connectivity than 5G. Additionally,
    6G is projected to enable ultra-long-range communication with a latency of less
    than 1 ms [[5](#CR5)]. The average experienced downlink (DL) data rates for 6G
    are expected to be 100 Gbps and the number of devices per km² will be 10⁹.

    stages with each generation provided added capabilities, as shown in Fig. [1](#Fig1).
    The evolution started with supporting only voice calls with 1G and over the time
    the next generation focused on increasing bandwidth and speed of data transmission
    that allowed the appearance of novel web and internet applications. The developments
    continued to generate 5G that is the main driver for massive broadband and various
    IoT applications and services. The expectation talks about 6G and how it can change
    how businesses work by allowing automation and AI and creating a connected world.

    not consider the security and privacy of users in their priorities. This makes
    these technologies suffer from severe security and privacy issues including cloning,
    eavesdropping, authentication and authorization issues. Because of the execution
    of wireless applications, 4G began to consider security, although it faced numerous
    security and privacy issues [[20](#CR20)]. Then, 5G and 6G did the same but with
    security threats that need to be handled to take all the benefits of 6G wireless
    networks. Looking at the security in 6G should be combined with AI as 5G and 6G
    have almost fully integrated with AI, which led to what is called security automation.
    At the same time, adversaries with the power of AI have become more powerful and

    networks. With the growing amount of IoT devices, the network capacity has to
    reach a demand fast. Wireless local area networks or even Femtocells, for example,
    are preferred when trying to increase the capacity of a network; However, transmitted
    information intended for the certified user equipment is more vulnerable to eavesdroppers
    and unauthorized users. This is because of broadcasting features of wireless communications

    another security threat. Different radio access network technologies are starting
    to be integrated with 6G, these include mmWave, Wi-Fi, NB-IoT and Li-Fi. There
    are potential risks with the integration of these technologies and could pose

    or her own terms [[66](#CR66)]. Patients can also have access control thanks to
    blockchain cryptographic keys. Each patient has a “master” key that allows them
    to “unlock” their health data and share a copy with healthcare providers as needed.
    Patients can limit their actions to reading or writing information, and they can
    revoke keys if the device on which the key is stored becomes hacked [[67](#CR67)].

    data modification. Furthermore, with the help of AI with 6G, DoS and DDoS attacks
    can be detected and provide availability and accessibility of healthcare services
    24/7 for authorized users. As blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger,
    a single point of failure associated with centralized systems will not exist and
    data can be accessed from any node in the blockchain network. The combination
    of 6G with AI can also provide an effective security solution to social engineering
    and phishing attacks by utilizing multi-layered intrusion detection and prevention
    techniques [[68](#CR68)].

    huge capabilities it provides, security and privacy are the major issues that
    6G need to address. Blockchain technology can play an important role to resolve
    some of these issues. The integration of 6G with blockchain can help to tackle
    the limitations in network security. The decentralized and distributed features
    can help to overcome the single point of failure and DoS attacks. The immutability
    of data can also increase data integrity. In the same regard, intelligence is
    a key feature of 6G networks, as the integration of AI with 6G networks can learn
    to achieve self-configuration, self-optimization, self-organization, and self-healing,
    and ultimately improving feasibility. The integration can also provide several
    advantages to overcome security and privacy challenges in 6G. For instance, multi-layered
    intrusion detection and prevention employing deep reinforcement learning and DNN
    can protect 6G against DDoS, flow table overloading, control plane saturation,
    IP spoofing, and host location hijacking attacks. The chapter provided an overview
    of 6G by discussing the main security and privacy issues in 6G networks. Then,
    the integration of blockchain with 6G was discussed by highlighting possible solutions
    to overcome security and privacy issues associated with 6G. The integration of
    6G with AI was presented by highlighting the importance of AI in 6G and how AI
    can provide better and effective security and privacy solutions in 6G. In the
    end, healthcare with 6G was presented as a use case by highlighting security issues
    and discussing the role of AI and blockchain in providing effective security solutions
    in the healthcare sector.![](../images/517376_1_En_5_Chapter/517376_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.png)
