- en: About 2 years ago, I told my husband that instead of pursuing the usual path
    for a thirty-something general counsel at a start-up—toward the next bigger and
    better company—I would dive headfirst into the blockchain business world. He was
    … surprised. And I am certain that, as he politely smiled and asked “why?” he
    was wondering if I had hit my midlife crisis earlier than expected.

    from all over the world,” I began my explanation, watching his expression change
    from shock to confusion.

    Well, I have two choices here. I can stay general counsel and keep telling everyone
    how to optimize their candy enjoyment while reminding them of the various sugar-related
    risks, all the while secretly salivating with my hands and mouth pressed against
    the window of the candy store. Or I can get in and gorge on the candy. So I decided
    to do the latter. I’ll get in early, help build the blockchain industry, and enjoy
    the process firsthand, instead of vicariously through the experiences of my colleagues.

    this incredibly exciting and promising new industry. If you’ve kept up with the
    news at all, you might already know that the highs have been very high, and the
    lows have been, well, very low.

    public and obfuscating the technology. And I have seen the industry professionalize
    and filter out the phonies. I have met many so-called experts who ooze confidence
    but lack competence, but I have seen an increasing number of high-integrity professionals
    learn together and persistently develop use cases for this very complicated technology.

    giving five, ten, twenty million dollars to any early-stage company, with no product
    and hardly anything to show beyond an idea—just an allegedly “amazing team” and
    the word “blockchain” thrown in there somewhere.

    start-ups. I wanted to know what I was missing, what they were seeing that I wasn’t.
    I watched highly successful, grown men behave like my 8-year-old daughters do
    in Claire’s when they are overwhelmed by shiny objects. Thankfully, this unsustainable
    enthusiasm ended. We’re back to a much more prudent approach to investing.

    and innovation. And I have increasingly seen companies put a serious effort into
    developing the technology and ecosystem. I have had many conversations about what
    is possible. And I have even seen several pilots and proof of concepts enter production
    and materialize in the real world.

    whether Hyperledger, Ethereum, or some other blockchain platform is the best.
    Even ignoring the seeming convergence of platforms, this debate is a bit like
    asking whether a fork or a spoon is a better tool. The answer is obvious: it depends
    on what you’re eating. And sometimes chopsticks enhance the experience even more.'

    I am convinced that blockchain technologies will transform our lives in our lifetime.
    The changes will grow but at first will be small and focused on efficiencies—bigger,
    stronger, better, faster, and cheaper.

    technologies mature, and the regulatory dust settles, we will focus on building
    a more functional, beautiful, and just world. Remember in the Disney film *The
    Little Mermaid* when Ariel uses the fork to brush her hair? She explores the potential
    of the tool before she can optimize its use. Once we discover the proper use of
    this tool called blockchain, we will start solving problems that have historically
    seemed unsolvable. Right now, we’re still brushing our hair with a fork.

    when I started practicing law, everyone was looking for “SaaS lawyers.” To be
    clear, “SaaS lawyers” is not a thing, at least not anymore! SaaS (software as
    a service) was an innovation caused by the emergence of new technology at the
    time. Most people didn’t know much about it, so everybody was looking for SaaS
    lawyers to draft SaaS agreements.

    We had to train a generation of lawyers to negotiate and draft SaaS agreements.
    I am happy to report that most technology attorneys are well trained and proficient
    in SaaS agreements. These days “SaaS lawyers” are no longer a hot commodity; they
    are everywhere technology companies operate.

    models, and demands for new skills. The question of business models can be broken
    down into two distinct questions.

- en: The first question is what new value is created? Through research and numerous
    interviews, I identify seven prominent values that seem to be developing using
    blockchain technologies. The seven values are not exhaustive even today. They
    are merely those that I deem to be most promising. I expect that other values
    will develop over time.

- en: The second question is, who, if anybody, can monetize this value? In this book,
    I primarily focus on the first question. You may think that it is premature to
    answer the second question, especially because the answer to the first question
    is still developing. Throughout the book I point out opportunities for enterprises
    and start-ups, though how we monetize blockchain technology will evolve in the
    next 5 to 10 years. So, keep an open mind and stay tuned!

    out reckless, at times irresponsible, and often confused—but full of potential.
    After all, the naïve investors throwing millions of dollars at a product they
    know nothing about and the snake oil salesmen deceiving them all see *something*
    in blockchain. It’s a highly exciting, though admittedly imperfect, emerging industry,
    but I strongly believe that as it matures, it will be harnessed to solve problems
    that we haven’t ever even tried to solve, problems we didn’t think could be solved.
    It will just require discipline, creative thinking, and persistence on the part
    of those developing it.
