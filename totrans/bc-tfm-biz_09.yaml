    by France, Germany, and unexpectedly the United Kingdom. That’s not all—in total
    69 countries^([1](#note1)) held elections in 2017, ranging from national elections,
    to regional or local elections. Most these countries still use a pen and paper
    to have citizens cast their votes and the votes are counted manually afterwards
    by a group of volunteers. Although various security measures are in place to prevent
    fraudulent activities during elections, it is not that difficult to manipulate
    votes (often referred to as vote rigging) and interfere with the process of an
    election, and either add or remove vote share for candidates. It happens in many
    countries, although no one who won an election would of course ever admit to electoral
    fraud, and it will continue to happen if we stick to pencil and paper to cast
    our votes.

    voting. The first-known use of electronic voting happened in 1991, when Belgium
    experimented with two types of electronic voting in two locations for the general
    election of 1991\. Approximately 25 countries have followed since and have experimented
    with electronic voting, all with different rates of success. For example, the
    Netherlands followed Belgium after a few years, but stopped electronic voting
    in 2007, when it was revealed that there were significant security problems with
    the voting machines (namely, they could easily be hacked). Belgium, on the other
    hand, still allows electronic voting using magnetic cards. Other countries that
    have experimented with electronic voting are Australia, Brazil, Canada, France,
    India, Switzerland, and of course Estonia. Estonia is by far the most advanced
    country in terms of electronic voting, which is made possible by the Estonian
    Digital ID card, a mandatory smart card for government services based on Public
    Key Infrastructure. Estonia started with electronic voting in 2005 and, in 2007,
    it was the first country in the world to allow online voting. In the 2015 parliamentary
    elections, 30.5% of the Estonians eligible to vote did so over the internet [297].

    still done with a pencil and a paper. Apart from being very traditional, voting
    with a pencil and paper is a slow process that is prone to errors and fraud. But
    there are more problems with our current voting system. Voting, nowadays, has
    low utility, meaning that, although all votes are counted, not all votes count.
    Making votes count is the basis of democracy in many countries. As a result, when
    the majority wins, minorities are often neglected. In addition, voting fraud is

    Although voting is such a fundamental part of democracy, it is not perfect, which
    could have contributed to how democracy has, or has not, evolved in the world.
    Democracy has not changed for hundreds of years, despite different tests with

    Each vote counts and the outcome is determined by the majority of the votes. It
    originated in the fifth century bc, when the Athenian democracy allowed its male
    citizens to control the entire political process [298]. Currently, the only known
    direct democracy exists in two Swiss Cantons [299] and this is because direct
    democracies pose multiple problems for today’s society. First of all, there are
    so many topics that require a decision that it is impossible for all citizens
    to be informed about all topics, because it would require too much time. In addition,
    we do not have the technological capabilities, or the funds, to vote on every
    topic, because, as mentioned, voting is a slow and manual process. These two problems
    make a direct democracy impractical on a daily basis.

    a represented democracy, citizens will vote for a delegate who represents their
    constituents. The system of elected officials is adopted by almost all western-style
    democracies, including Australia, the Netherlands, and the USA. It has become
    so popular because it is seen as the most efficient form of democracy. However,
    a represented democracy presents its own problems. First of all, in many countries
    there is a disconnection between citizens and politicians, and citizens no longer
    trust the traditional parties of elected officials representing the citizens.
    Representatives are only loosely held accountable for their actions [300] and
    promises are not necessarily kept. In addition, the problem with having elected
    delegates is that corruption becomes possible. Power corrupts and, in some countries,
    delegates listen to money rather than the people who elected them. Finally, countries
    that use a two-party system, such as the USA, significantly limit the choices
    that citizens have, whereas in multi-party systems, such as in the Netherlands,
    coalitions need to be formed, often taking months. In both systems, progress is
    slow.

    multiple shareholders, or even goes public with thousands of shareholders, direct

    characteristics of voting that are vital for a democratic process. First, if you
    vote, you need to know that you will be able to submit your vote for it to be
    counted. This is called censorship resistance and it refers to the electoral fraud
    of disenfranchisement. The second characteristic is that, after casting, you need
    to know, and be certain, that your vote was included in the result. This is called
    consensus protocol and refers to the electoral fraud of misrecording votes. Finally,
    you need to know, and be certain, that your vote, and others, will not be changed
    after they have been cast. This is called immutability of votes and refers also
    to the electoral fraud of misrecording [303]. Without these three key aspects
    of voting, the democratic process is deemed to fail. Until today we have trusted
    electoral committees to ensure that these key characteristics were in place, at
    least in western democratic countries, and this is why it works. However, it is
    impossible for individuals to check to be 100% sure that their vote was included,
    counted, and not changed afterwards. Blockchain, however, being an immutable,
    verifiable, and traceable record of data, can change this and the combination
    of Blockchain and liquid democracy offers a chance to solve many, if not all,
    problems currently related to voting.

    a represented democracy. It is also known as ‘delegative democracy’, ‘proxy voting’,
    or ‘voluntary direct democracy’ and is a fairly new concept. Liquid democracy
    (see Figure 8.1) enables citizens to choose which role they want to take in the
    political process (or strategy process in the case of organisations). Either they
    choose to vote directly on individual policy issues or they can choose to delegate
    their vote to competent delegates who vote on their behalf.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Delegation of votes is policy specific, meaning that you can delegate your voting
    power to multiple experts in different domains and any vote can be retracted instantly.
    As a result, delegates who have attracted many votes, and so have gained a lot
    of power, can lose that power at any given moment [304]. Delegates are people
    with domain-specific knowledge that can influence decision-making if they manage
    to attract sufficient votes, resulting in better governance, because no, or fewer,
    politicians with more generic knowledge are involved in policy-making [300]. Different
    delegates can exercise different levels of decision-making power and the delegates
    involved in the political process depend on the topic up for a decision. In addition,
    delegates can re-delegate their voting authority on certain topics with which
    they feel less comfortable. In this way, experts can accumulate large amounts
    of voting authority relatively quickly [305], which is why a fluid democracy naturally
    evolves into a meritocracy.

- en: There are multiple advantages of liquid democracy [300], above all it being
    truly democratic, while solving the problems of a represented democracy. Individuals
    have complete freedom to decide how they want to vote—whether they want to remain
    passive and delegate all their votes to one person, or multiple representatives,
    whether they want to vote on each topic themselves, or even whether they do not
    want to vote at all. In addition, anyone can become a delegate and start collecting
    voting authority and as a consequence decision-making power. Political parties
    are no longer required to win votes and because individuals select delegates based
    on expertise and not political colour, everyone can tailor make ‘their own political
    party’ by selecting those experts, or friends, whom they trust most for the different
    topics. However, any delegate can just as easily lose any voting authority if
    they mislead the individuals who have entrusted their votes to them, work with
    lobbyists, or take money for their vote from organisations. As such, lobbyists
    will no longer be needed, corruption in politics will cease to exist, and delegates
    will be held directly accountable for their actions, saving billions of dollars
    annually. As a result, democracy evolves in a network of experts, making well-informed
    decisions that are not based on political grounds, resulting in better governance
    and strategy making.

    works. As the underlying technical infrastructure, Blockchain is important because
    it enables the casting and delegation of votes. It also prevents participants

    smart contracts, Public Key Infrastructure, cryptography, tokenisation, self-sovereign
    identity, verification, and reputation, in addition to algorithmic up/down voting
    of proposals. It would work as follows: anyone can propose legislation and the
    best, most popular, or best articulated proposals will receive the most votes
    and therefore have the greatest reach. The cream will rise to the top, similar
    to the voting systems that manage comments and articles on Reddit. The most popular
    proposals can be discussed and improved using consensus on the exact wording by
    those interested in the topic and with expert knowledge. Of course, any action
    related to creating a proposal will be recorded on the blockchain, so that it
    will always be possible to trace back how the proposal was developed and who was
    involved. Once one or more proposals are deemed ready for voting, a popular vote
    could be organised instantly and participants can vote, or they can delegate their
    vote, using their smartphone, tablet, or computer. Smart contracts will monitor
    any delegation of votes. In order to vote, your self-sovereign identity will be
    verified using the Public Key Infrastructure and biometrics information, so it
    is known who is voting as well as to prevent voting under duress because voting
    will no longer be required in a secure and private space (a scan of your face
    using your smartphone’s camera and your fingerprints, for example, could reveal
    if that would be the case). Your vote will be tokenised, time stamped, and added
    to the blockchain. At any time before the closing date you can change, withdraw,
    or (re-)delegate your vote. The blockchain will record all ‘transactions’, ensuring
    that the public can at any time inspect that their own vote has been submitted,
    has been included in the results, and has not been changed. Users can also see
    the number of votes each proposal has received. Results will be available instantly
    once the ‘e-ballot box’ closes. Of course, such a complex system requires significant
    administration and governance. Although the basic administration can be taken
    care of by artificial intelligence, humans would still need to be involved, similar
    to moderators on online platforms. These moderators can be selected based on their
    reputation, and possible shadow reputation, and can be held accountable at any
    time.'

    vote is included in the result and not changed afterwards. It would work by using
    the Public Key Infrastructure, cryptography, tokenisation of votes, and, although
    Estonia already enables voting online, initially it could require citizens to
    still go to a polling station where they can use a secure computer.

    which would mean a significant change to the constitution. It would also mean
    that, by voting for such constitutional change, representatives and parties would
    put themselves out of a job, which would mean loss of influence, power, and money.
    It is likely, therefore, that many elected representatives would not even start
    to think about implementation of a new democratic system and everything will remain
    as it is. For now, only progressive and digitally advanced governments such as

    to move to a new approach in voting, for popular television shows such as The

    voting. It would be relatively simple to implement and would familiarise a large
    group of people with blockchain and the possibilities of online voting. Television
    shows would benefit from increased transparency in their voting system. At the
    same time, organisations could start to look at developing new approaches to governance
    and shareholder or boardroom voting. ConsenSys, a developer of products based
    on Ethereum, was, in 2017, developing BoardRoom, a decision-making platform for

    verification system of Google+ to verify users, and Google Votes was a web application
    integrated into Google’s internal Google+ network. Anyone in the network could
    create issues, which, once created, were opened up for voting to all, or a select
    group of, users. Users could discuss the issues and vote or delegate their votes.
    The system enabled delegation advertisements, which enabled people to convince
    others why they should delegate their vote to them. This enabled group leaders

    years of operation, the employees at Google created 370 issues and 20,000 involved
    employees cast over 87,000 votes, of which 3.6% were delegated votes. The development

    small(er) organisations to test the workings of a liquid democracy, which in the

    ability to reorganise political power by trading votes. They can forgo their vote

    [310]. They built a digital platform that enabled citizens to tell the representative
    how to vote on the different issues. It is not a full liquid democratic system,

    just 1.2% of the vote so their representative was not elected to the city council.

    for the second time, they were told that they had to bribe a federal judge to
    participate [310], which shows the resistance that can be expected when moving
    to a new democratic system. Eventually, the idea moved into a not-for-profit organisation
    called Democracy Earth Foundation. This foundation uses an incorruptible identity
    platform to record votes and the platform was piloted during the 2017 Colombian
    Peace Referendum. The pilot enabled 7 million Colombians who fled the country

    secure online voting using blockchain, but the technology is still very new, so
    more research will be needed. Once the technology has become readily available
    for organisations, and potentially governments, to use, it will be necessary to
    educate the people. Liquid democracy will mean a radical shift in voting for citizens
    and it will require them to trust technology with which they might not be very
    familiar. Educating the public about how liquid democracy works could be achieved
    by using liquid democracy systems in popular TV shows, small organisations, or
    local governments. In particular, in commercial applications, such as the Google
    Votes experiment, blockchain technology is not, at first, required. The next step
    would be to have a new identity system in place, as explained in [Chapter 3](ch0003.xlink.xhtml).
    Self-sovereign identity is key to liquid democracy, because, once citizens can
    prove their identity through cryptography, it becomes possible to build a variety
    of new services on top of it, which is currently not even imaginable. From there
    on, more organisations and citizens can become aware of the possibilities of liquid
    democracy, leading eventually to a possible shift in democratic systems. However,
    it is highly unlikely that this will happen any time soon, because a shift in
    democratic systems will put all those politicians who voted in favour out of a

    [311]. The algorithm has an actual vote on where the company will invest. Fast
    forward this a few years and the board of directors could consist completely of
    algorithms that execute investment decisions based on the voting results of the
    shareholders of the company. Combining blockchain-based voting systems with smart
    contracts enables the automatic execution of a certain decision or policy based
    on the results of the election, which could significantly speed up the decision-making/democratic
    processes.

    is already used for proxy voting during annual general meetings (AGMs). These
    meetings tend to be high-cost events, with low shareholder participation. In an
    increasingly global world, where investments are made across the globe, investor
    engagement becomes important, but participating in person becomes more difficult.
    Therefore, a new solution is required that enables shareholders to exercise their
    rights in a secure and transparent way, which at the same time could foster cross-border
    investments. As a consequence, in 2016, Russia’s central securities depository,
    National Settlements Depository, a member of the Moscow exchange, developed and
    tested a blockchain prototype for proxy voting [312]. The open-source, e-proxy
    voting system prototype was developed to securely process electronic interaction
    between security holders and issuers when exchanging information during the meetings
    of the holders of the annual securities. The voting instructions are stored on
    a private blockchain, accessible to all nodes in the network. If a regulator needs
    to get access to these instructions, they can simply do so by joining the private
    blockchain network. All records are distributed among participating members, making
    the voting instructions immutable, verifiable, and traceable.

    Broadridge Financial Solutions, JPMorgan, Northern Trust, and Banco Santander
    successfully accomplished a blockchain pilot developed to improve transparency
    in the proxy voting process [313] during an AGM. The pilot acted as a ‘shadow’
    digital copy of votes cast by the shareholders. The objective of the pilot was
    to increase transparency during proxy voting as part of the AGM, and as a result
    to improve corporate governance. Blockchain-enabled voting during AGMs will remove
    the complexity of proxy voting during traditional AGMs, while increasing the quality
    and efficiency of proxy voting.

    democratic system and eliminate electoral fraud. At first, it could be used to
    simply improve the existing system of representative democracy. Bringing voting
    online using Blockchain, as seen in Estonia, makes votes immutable, verifiable,
    and traceable, which is a significant improvement to the existing system. It will
    reduce or eliminate electoral fraud, and will make results instantly available,
    as soon as the election closes. When votes are recorded on a blockchain, it will
    enable citizens to be 100% sure that their vote has been submitted, counted, and
    not been changed, while ensuring complete privacy for the voter. Although voting
    over the internet, as done in Estonia, might still be far away for many countries,
    improving and linking existing, albeit insecure, voting computers to the blockchain
    could already significantly improve the electoral processes. A natural next step
    would be to enable voting over the internet, so that voters could participate
    in the election without having to go to the ballot box, which will probably increase
    voter participation if citizens can vote anywhere by simply using their smartphone.
    In 2016, in the Australian state Victoria, Australia Post started developing a
    blockchain-based e-voting system. It is building an independent e-voting application,
    linked to its existing identity platform, which offers anonymous voting and prevents
    electoral fraud by allowing only one vote per identity and monitoring misuse.
    The localised solution for corporate, civic, and community organisations will
    help governments and the public become familiar with a new system, while offering
    insights into voter behaviour and preparing the traditional voting process for
    the 21st century [38].

    that the first organisations to start with this will be publicly listed companies,
    which want to improve corporate governance. Blockchain-enabled e-proxy voting
    will offer corporations a secure and immutable digital copy of voting instructions
    cast by shareholders during an AGM. In 2016, Nasdaq experimented with using blockchain
    to record ownership of securities and offer voting right assets based on those
    assets to shareholders [314]. The company worked with the Tallinn Stock Exchange
    and it benefited from the already developed digital identification solutions.
    Consequently, shareholders with the right voting right asset could view relevant
    information, transfer voting rights to a proxy, monitor the proxy, and recall
    if necessary and review previous meetings and votes [315].

    e-voting and e-proxy voting using Blockchain, perhaps there is a chance of slowly
    changing democratic systems as well. This will give policy-making processes back
    to the people, while creating an efficient, trustworthy, immutable, and verifiable
    electoral system that minimises fraud. It is a lot to ask of existing leaders
    in power and time will tell if there are governments who dare to take the leap
    forward.
