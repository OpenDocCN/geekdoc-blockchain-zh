    by France, Germany, and unexpectedly the United Kingdom. That’s not all—in total
    69 countries^([1](#note1)) held elections in 2017, ranging from national elections,
    to regional or local elections. Most these countries still use a pen and paper
    to have citizens cast their votes and the votes are counted manually afterwards
    by a group of volunteers. Although various security measures are in place to prevent
    fraudulent activities during elections, it is not that difficult to manipulate
    votes (often referred to as vote rigging) and interfere with the process of an
    election, and either add or remove vote share for candidates. It happens in many
    countries, although no one who won an election would of course ever admit to electoral
    fraud, and it will continue to happen if we stick to pencil and paper to cast
    our votes.

    voting. The first-known use of electronic voting happened in 1991, when Belgium
    experimented with two types of electronic voting in two locations for the general
    election of 1991\. Approximately 25 countries have followed since and have experimented
    with electronic voting, all with different rates of success. For example, the
    Netherlands followed Belgium after a few years, but stopped electronic voting
    in 2007, when it was revealed that there were significant security problems with
    the voting machines (namely, they could easily be hacked). Belgium, on the other
    hand, still allows electronic voting using magnetic cards. Other countries that
    have experimented with electronic voting are Australia, Brazil, Canada, France,
    India, Switzerland, and of course Estonia. Estonia is by far the most advanced
    country in terms of electronic voting, which is made possible by the Estonian
    Digital ID card, a mandatory smart card for government services based on Public
    Key Infrastructure. Estonia started with electronic voting in 2005 and, in 2007,
    it was the first country in the world to allow online voting. In the 2015 parliamentary
    elections, 30.5% of the Estonians eligible to vote did so over the internet [297].

    with a pencil and paper is a slow process that is prone to errors and fraud. But

    Each vote counts and the outcome is determined by the majority of the votes. It
    originated in the fifth century bc, when the Athenian democracy allowed its male
    citizens to control the entire political process [298]. Currently, the only known
    direct democracy exists in two Swiss Cantons [299] and this is because direct
    democracies pose multiple problems for today’s society. First of all, there are
    so many topics that require a decision that it is impossible for all citizens
    to be informed about all topics, because it would require too much time. In addition,
    we do not have the technological capabilities, or the funds, to vote on every

    democracies, including Australia, the Netherlands, and the USA. It has become
    so popular because it is seen as the most efficient form of democracy. However,
    a represented democracy presents its own problems. First of all, in many countries
    there is a disconnection between citizens and politicians, and citizens no longer
    trust the traditional parties of elected officials representing the citizens.
    Representatives are only loosely held accountable for their actions [300] and
    promises are not necessarily kept. In addition, the problem with having elected
    delegates is that corruption becomes possible. Power corrupts and, in some countries,
    delegates listen to money rather than the people who elected them. Finally, countries
    that use a two-party system, such as the USA, significantly limit the choices

    multiple shareholders, or even goes public with thousands of shareholders, direct

    vote, you need to know that you will be able to submit your vote for it to be
    counted. This is called censorship resistance and it refers to the electoral fraud
    of disenfranchisement. The second characteristic is that, after casting, you need
    to know, and be certain, that your vote was included in the result. This is called
    consensus protocol and refers to the electoral fraud of misrecording votes. Finally,
    you need to know, and be certain, that your vote, and others, will not be changed
    after they have been cast. This is called immutability of votes and refers also
    to the electoral fraud of misrecording [303]. Without these three key aspects
    of voting, the democratic process is deemed to fail. Until today we have trusted
    electoral committees to ensure that these key characteristics were in place, at
    least in western democratic countries, and this is why it works. However, it is
    impossible for individuals to check to be 100% sure that their vote was included,
    counted, and not changed afterwards. Blockchain, however, being an immutable,
    verifiable, and traceable record of data, can change this and the combination

    with domain-specific knowledge that can influence decision-making if they manage
    to attract sufficient votes, resulting in better governance, because no, or fewer,
    politicians with more generic knowledge are involved in policy-making [300]. Different
    delegates can exercise different levels of decision-making power and the delegates
    involved in the political process depend on the topic up for a decision. In addition,
    delegates can re-delegate their voting authority on certain topics with which

    will no longer be needed, corruption in politics will cease to exist, and delegates
    will be held directly accountable for their actions, saving billions of dollars

    related to creating a proposal will be recorded on the blockchain, so that it
    will always be possible to trace back how the proposal was developed and who was
    involved. Once one or more proposals are deemed ready for voting, a popular vote
    could be organised instantly and participants can vote, or they can delegate their
    vote, using their smartphone, tablet, or computer. Smart contracts will monitor
    any delegation of votes. In order to vote, your self-sovereign identity will be
    verified using the Public Key Infrastructure and biometrics information, so it
    is known who is voting as well as to prevent voting under duress because voting
    will no longer be required in a secure and private space (a scan of your face
    using your smartphone’s camera and your fingerprints, for example, could reveal
    if that would be the case). Your vote will be tokenised, time stamped, and added
    to the blockchain. At any time before the closing date you can change, withdraw,
    or (re-)delegate your vote. The blockchain will record all ‘transactions’, ensuring
    that the public can at any time inspect that their own vote has been submitted,
    has been included in the results, and has not been changed. Users can also see
    the number of votes each proposal has received. Results will be available instantly
    once the ‘e-ballot box’ closes. Of course, such a complex system requires significant
    administration and governance. Although the basic administration can be taken
    care of by artificial intelligence, humans would still need to be involved, similar
    to moderators on online platforms. These moderators can be selected based on their
    reputation, and possible shadow reputation, and can be held accountable at any
    time.'

    which would mean a significant change to the constitution. It would also mean
    that, by voting for such constitutional change, representatives and parties would
    put themselves out of a job, which would mean loss of influence, power, and money.
    It is likely, therefore, that many elected representatives would not even start

    to move to a new approach in voting, for popular television shows such as The

    voting. It would be relatively simple to implement and would familiarise a large
    group of people with blockchain and the possibilities of online voting. Television
    shows would benefit from increased transparency in their voting system. At the
    same time, organisations could start to look at developing new approaches to governance
    and shareholder or boardroom voting. ConsenSys, a developer of products based
    on Ethereum, was, in 2017, developing BoardRoom, a decision-making platform for
    organisations to simplify board member elections, budget allocation, shareholder
    voting, and more. Subsequently, larger organisations can start to experiment with

    about, they can empower other experts. With this idea, Flux participated in the

    called DemocracyOS. This was started in 2013 with the objective of hacking the
    democracy in Buenos Aires. The representatives from the local political party
    promised always to vote on political issues according to the will of the citizens
    [310]. They built a digital platform that enabled citizens to tell the representative
    how to vote on the different issues. It is not a full liquid democratic system,
    more a hybrid form of liquid and representative democracy. DemocracyOS achieved
    just 1.2% of the vote so their representative was not elected to the city council.
    However, the initiative did garner the attention of organisations and governments
    around the world, and eventually the government in Buenos Aires tried to use the
    system to get feedback from citizens. When DemocracyOS tried to run a candidate
    for the second time, they were told that they had to bribe a federal judge to
    participate [310], which shows the resistance that can be expected when moving
    to a new democratic system. Eventually, the idea moved into a not-for-profit organisation
    called Democracy Earth Foundation. This foundation uses an incorruptible identity
    platform to record votes and the platform was piloted during the 2017 Colombian
    Peace Referendum. The pilot enabled 7 million Colombians who fled the country
    during the war to vote, together with those aged under 18 years. Although these

    more research will be needed. Once the technology has become readily available
    for organisations, and potentially governments, to use, it will be necessary to
    educate the people. Liquid democracy will mean a radical shift in voting for citizens
    and it will require them to trust technology with which they might not be very
    familiar. Educating the public about how liquid democracy works could be achieved
    by using liquid democracy systems in popular TV shows, small organisations, or
    local governments. In particular, in commercial applications, such as the Google
    Votes experiment, blockchain technology is not, at first, required. The next step
    would be to have a new identity system in place, as explained in [Chapter 3](ch0003.xlink.xhtml).
    Self-sovereign identity is key to liquid democracy, because, once citizens can
    prove their identity through cryptography, it becomes possible to build a variety
    of new services on top of it, which is currently not even imaginable. From there
    on, more organisations and citizens can become aware of the possibilities of liquid
    democracy, leading eventually to a possible shift in democratic systems. However,
    it is highly unlikely that this will happen any time soon, because a shift in
    democratic systems will put all those politicians who voted in favour out of a

    intelligence. Customers, shareholders, or board members could use such a system
    to make decisions and, when combined with smart contracts, this could trigger
    automatic implementation of those decisions or investment choices. This does not
    have to be in the far future. Already, the Hong Kong-based venture capital firm
    Deep Knowledge Ventures has given an algorithm a seat on the board of directors
    [311]. The algorithm has an actual vote on where the company will invest. Fast
    forward this a few years and the board of directors could consist completely of

- en: Using blockchain in our democratic processes could significantly improve the
    democratic system and eliminate electoral fraud. At first, it could be used to
    simply improve the existing system of representative democracy. Bringing voting
    online using Blockchain, as seen in Estonia, makes votes immutable, verifiable,
    and traceable, which is a significant improvement to the existing system. It will
    reduce or eliminate electoral fraud, and will make results instantly available,
    as soon as the election closes. When votes are recorded on a blockchain, it will
    enable citizens to be 100% sure that their vote has been submitted, counted, and
    not been changed, while ensuring complete privacy for the voter. Although voting
    over the internet, as done in Estonia, might still be far away for many countries,
    improving and linking existing, albeit insecure, voting computers to the blockchain
    could already significantly improve the electoral processes. A natural next step
    would be to enable voting over the internet, so that voters could participate
    in the election without having to go to the ballot box, which will probably increase
    voter participation if citizens can vote anywhere by simply using their smartphone.
    In 2016, in the Australian state Victoria, Australia Post started developing a
    blockchain-based e-voting system. It is building an independent e-voting application,
    linked to its existing identity platform, which offers anonymous voting and prevents
    electoral fraud by allowing only one vote per identity and monitoring misuse.
    The localised solution for corporate, civic, and community organisations will
    help governments and the public become familiar with a new system, while offering
    insights into voter behaviour and preparing the traditional voting process for
    the 21st century [38].

    will offer corporations a secure and immutable digital copy of voting instructions
    cast by shareholders during an AGM. In 2016, Nasdaq experimented with using blockchain
    to record ownership of securities and offer voting right assets based on those
    assets to shareholders [314]. The company worked with the Tallinn Stock Exchange
    and it benefited from the already developed digital identification solutions.
    Consequently, shareholders with the right voting right asset could view relevant
    information, transfer voting rights to a proxy, monitor the proxy, and recall
    if necessary and review previous meetings and votes [315].

  zh: 然而，在政府转向基于区块链的投票之前，首先可能开始尝试的将是上市公司，它们希望改善公司治理。基于区块链的电子代理投票将为公司提供一个安全且不可篡改的数字副本，记录股东在公司年度股东大会（AGM）上投下的投票指示。2016年，纳斯达克尝试使用区块链来记录证券所有权，并根据这些资产向股东提供投票权资产[314]。该公司与塔林证券交易所合作，并从中受益于已经开发的数字身份验证解决方案。因此，拥有相应投票权资产的股东可以查看相关信息，将投票权委托给代理人，监控代理人，如有必要可以召回并回顾之前的会议和投票[315]。
- en: Once organisations and (local) governments have become familiar with online
    e-voting and e-proxy voting using Blockchain, perhaps there is a chance of slowly
    changing democratic systems as well. This will give policy-making processes back
    to the people, while creating an efficient, trustworthy, immutable, and verifiable
    electoral system that minimises fraud. It is a lot to ask of existing leaders
    in power and time will tell if there are governments who dare to take the leap
    forward.

  zh: 一旦组织和（地方）政府熟悉了基于区块链的在线电子投票和电子代理投票，或许就有机会逐渐改变民主制度。这将把政策制定过程还给人民，同时创建一个高效、值得信赖、不可篡改且可验证的选举体系，最小化欺诈。这对现有执政领导人的要求很高，时间将告诉我们是否有政府敢于迈出前进的一步。
