- en: As the cryptocurrency asset management space has grown at a fast pace, the speed
    of the industry’s implementation of rigid compliance controls and procedures has
    often played catch up to the inflows of capital into the space. Further contributing
    to lags in the implementation of rigorous compliance throughout the crypto fund
    space has been continued regulatory uncertainty in the space. This uncertainty
    has come across a range of areas from the most basic questions as to whether or
    not the crypto industry should be regulated, and therefore, have basic mandated
    compliance controls to more topic-specific items such as governments struggling
    to boost the rates of crypto tax compliance.[¹](#FPar1)

    has many different applications in the cryptocurrency and digital asset space.
    For example, there are technical applications of compliance in areas such as anti-money
    laundering (AML) compliance. This is covered in Chapter [5](513667_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml).
    Another aspect of compliance and governance is broad adherence to laws and rules
    promulgated by financial regulators and legislators. This will be covered in Chapter
    [6](513667_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml). In this chapter, we will cover the implementation
    of a compliance and governance framework at both the management company and fund
    level for crypto-asset managers.

    implementing the legislation passed by regulators. In the process of this implementation,
    the regulators will generally further define the specifics of the compliance requirements
    that a crypto-asset manager must adhere to. This process is known as regulatory
    *rulemaking*.

- en: Due to the fact that these mandatory compliance obligations are heavily influenced
    by the work of the regulators, mandatory compliance is also referred to as ***regulatory
    compliance***. Another term used for mandatory compliance is ***minimum compliance***
    because mandatory compliance refers to the minimum level of compliance obligations
    that a crypto-asset manager must adhere to in order to operate legally.

- en: As compared to mandatory compliance, ***voluntary compliance*** refers to the
    compliance obligations that a crypto-asset manager is not required to follow but
    voluntarily chooses to follow. There are two primary sources of these voluntary
    compliance obligations. The first comes in the form of what is known as ***regulatory
    guidance***. Regulatory guidance is effective advice from regulators as to how
    a certain mandatory practice should be implemented, as well as how compliance
    practices that are not yet mandatory but will likely be mandatory in the future
    should be addressed. Regulators often communicate guidance through methods such
    as speeches at industry conferences and by publishing position statements.

    mandatory compliance obligations on crypto-asset managers if they meet certain
    regulatory exemptions and therefore, are not required to be registered with a
    financial regulator. The short answer is that even if a crypto fund manager is
    not required to be registered, they are still subject to some form of supervision
    by financial regulators.

  zh: 许多人常见的混淆点是，如果加密资产管理者符合某些监管豁免条件，从而无需向金融监管机构注册，是否仍需遵守任何强制合规义务。简短答案是，即使加密基金管理者无需注册，他们仍需接受金融监管机构某种形式的监督。
- en: One of the most common examples of this would be in the U.S. under the Securities
    and Exchange Commission (SEC) regime. Under sections ***3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of
    the Investment Company Act*** ***of 1940 (‘40 Act)***, there are exemptions, commonly
    referred to as the private adviser exemption, under which a private fund manager
    inclusive of crypto-asset managers, would not be required to registered with the
    SEC. There are several of these exemptions including an exemption for certain
    types of venture capital funds. The original exemptions outlined in the ‘40 Act
    were further restricted by legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Act. While there
    are a number of technicalities to the specific application of the relevant SEC
    registration exemptions available to crypto fund managers, a key metric that is
    often utilized as a gateway issue to determine if a crypto manager would be eligible
    for a registration exemption is tied to the fund manager's assets under management
    (AUM). It is worth noting that for the purposes of determining eligibility with
    the exemption requirements a crypto fund manager's AUM is not always as straightforward
    as net assets or simply adding up the total of all investment capital received.
    Instead, the regulators calculate a number known as ***Regulatory Assets Under
    Management (RAUM)***. RAUM is different from AUM in that it is gross assets, which
    includes leverage, as well as adds in capital that may have been committed but
    not yet called from investors.[³](#FPar1)
  id: totrans-17

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在美国证券交易委员会（SEC）制度下，这是最常见的例子之一。根据1940年《投资公司法》第3（c）（1）和第3（c）（7）节，存在通常被称为私募顾问豁免的豁免，其中包括加密货币资产管理者的私募基金管理者无需向SEC注册。这些豁免中包括某些类型的风险资本基金。在《投资公司法》中最初规定的豁免进一步被如多德-弗兰克法案之类的立法限制。尽管对于加密货币基金管理者可用的具体SEC注册豁免的技术细节很多，但一个经常用作决定加密货币管理者是否有资格获得注册豁免的入门问题的关键指标与基金管理者的资产管理规模（AUM）相关。值得注意的是，对于确定与豁免要求相关的资格，加密货币基金管理者的AUM并不总是像净资产一样简单，或者仅仅是将所有投资资本相加。相反，监管机构计算出一个被称为**管理资产规模（RAUM）**的数字。RAUM与AUM的不同之处在于，它是总资产，包括杠杆，以及包括投资者尚未要求但可能已经承诺的资本。
    [³](#FPar1)
- en: If a private fund manager has an RAUM of less than $150 million, then they would
    generally be exempt from registering with the US SEC as an ***Investment Adviser
    (IA)***. This $150 million threshold applies on an ongoing basis and not at any
    particular time. For example, if a new crypto fund at launch has $50 million,
    then it would generally be exempt from IA registration. However, if the fund continues
    to raise capital, then once they hit $150 million, they would need to register.
    Similarly, if a crypto fund at launch attracts a great deal of interest from investors
    and will have $200 million on its first day of trading then it would need to register
    as an IA at launch.
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果一个私募基金管理者的RAUM小于1.5亿美元，那么他们通常可以免于向美国证券交易委员会（SEC）注册为投资顾问（IA）。这个1.5亿美元的标准是持续适用的，而不是在特定时间点适用。例如，如果一个新成立的加密货币基金在启动时拥有5000万美元，那么它通常可以免于注册IA。然而，如果该基金继续筹集资金，一旦达到1.5亿美元，它们就需要注册。同样，如果一个新成立的加密货币基金在第一天交易时吸引了大量投资者的兴趣，并将有2亿美元资金，那么它需要在启动时注册为IA。
- en: With an understanding of this framework in place we can now return to our original
    question of if a crypto-asset manager is below $150 million in RAUM, and therefore
    subject to SEC exemption, does this mean that they have no mandatory compliance
    requirements under the SEC? The answer is no. Even if a crypto fund is exempt,
    they still may be subject to reporting requirements. These types of exempt managers
    are therefore referred to not as IAs but Exempt Reporting Advisers (ERAs). A common
    form ERAs are required to file is US SEC Form ADV Part (1)(A).
  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在理解了这个框架的基础上，我们现在可以回到我们最初的问题上：如果一个加密货币资产管理者的管理资产规模（RAUM）低于1.5亿美元，并且因此受到美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的豁免，这意味着他们不需要遵守SEC的强制性合规要求吗？答案是不是。即使一个加密货币基金获得了豁免，它们仍然可能需要遵守报告要求。因此，这些类型的豁免管理者被称作不是投资顾问（IA），而是豁免报告顾问（ERAs）。ERAs需要提交的常见表格是美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的ADV表格第一部分（1）（A）。
- en: It is also important to note that in addition to reporting requirements, exempt
    crypto funds are also still subjected to a number of laws and rules that apply
    regardless of their registration status. An example of this would be restrictions
    on political donations given by a fund manager in order to secure business from
    the government, commonly known as the pay-to-play rule.[⁴](#FPar1) Additionally,
    simply because a crypto manager is exempt, this does not mean that they could
    not be subjected to examinations or be required to respond to information requests
    from regulators in much the same way that a registered entity would be required
    to respond to these items.

  zh: 还需要注意的是，除了报告要求，免于注册的加密基金仍需遵守许多无论其注册状态如何都适用的法律和规则。一个例子就是为从政府获得业务而给予基金管理者的政治捐赠限制，这通常被称为支付参与规则。[⁴](#FPar1)
    另外，即使加密管理者免于注册，这并不意味着他们不会受到监管机构的检查，或者不需要像注册实体那样回应信息请求。
- en: It is also important to keep in mind that regardless of any requirements for
    registration or exemption that may apply to a crypto-asset manager at the federal
    government level, such as with the SEC, there may also be different regional requirements
    for managers to register. In the US the example of this would be a requirement
    for a crypto-asset manager to register at the state level with the financial regulatory
    authority. State-level regulators may have additional regulations and reporting
    requirements that the crypto fund may need to adhere to as well.

  zh: 还需要牢记，无论适用于加密资产管理者联邦政府级别的注册或豁免要求如何，例如美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的情况，对于管理者来说可能还存在不同的地区注册要求。在美国，这方面的例子就是加密资产管理者需要向州级金融监管机构注册的要求。州级监管机构可能会有额外的规定和报告要求，加密基金可能也需要遵守。

    the compliance function at a crypto manager. When managing a crypto fund certain
    activities are performed by the employees of the fund manager and certain activities
    can be outsourced to third parties. As we introduced in Chapter [1](513667_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml),
    these third parties are commonly called ***vendors*** or ***service providers***.
    From a compliance perspective, the activities performed by employees of the fund

  zh: 所需的内部合规资源
- en: From a practical perspective, it is not considered best practice for a crypto
    fund to entirely outsource their compliance function to third-party service providers.
    A key reason for this is because by maintaining in-house ownership of compliance
    resources, the thinking is that the crypto fund will be more directly involved
    in ongoing compliance management. From a regulatory perspective, the vast majority
    of jurisdictions where crypto fund managers are likely to be based will be in
    locations where the financial regulators require the crypto fund to maintain an
    in-house ***Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)***. A CCO is the individual who is
    responsible for overseeing the compliance function at a crypto fund. An example
    of such a requirement in the UK is the requirement by the Financial Conduct Authority
    (FCA) for certain classes of crypto funds to maintain a CCO that holds the CF
    10 Compliance Oversight Function designation. Another example of this type of
    requirement is in the US for registered crypto funds to maintain a CCO is in SEC
    Rule 206(4)-7 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 从实际角度来看，将合规功能完全外包给第三方服务提供商并不被视为最佳实践。这主要是因为通过保持内部合规资源的归属，人们认为加密货币基金会更直接地参与持续的合规管理。从监管角度来看，加密货币基金管理者可能所在的绝大多数司法管区，都要求加密货币基金维持内部首席合规官（CCO）。CCO是负责监督加密货币基金合规功能的个人。例如，英国金融行为监管局（FCA）要求某些类别的加密货币基金维持持有CF
    10合规监督功能指定（CF 10 Compliance Oversight Function designation）的CCO。美国注册加密货币基金维持CCO的另一项此类要求是1940年投资顾问法案的SEC规则206(4)-7。
- en: To be clear this does not mean that a crypto fund cannot utilize third-party
    vendors to assist in the compliance function. What these regulatory rules mean
    is that an employee of the crypto fund itself must be designated as the CCO. You
    may be asking what is the purpose of an in-house designated CCO, if all the compliance
    work is outsourced? The purpose of requiring a in-house employee of the crypto
    asset manager to be designated as CCO is to make someone who is in-house directly
    accountable for ensuring that the compliance function is properly implemented
    and maintained. The motivating force behind this in-house CCO model therefore,
    is to create a sense of ownership and accountability within the crypto fund manager
    itself as opposed to having the ownership lie exclusively with third-party vendors.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 需要明确，这并不意味着加密货币基金不能利用第三方供应商协助合规功能。这些监管规则的含义是，加密货币基金本身必须指定一名员工为CCO。你可能会问，如果所有合规工作都外包了，内部指定CCO的目的是什么？要求加密货币资产管理者内部员工指定为CCO的目的，是让某人直接对确保合规功能得到适当实施和维护负责。因此，推动这种内部CCO模型的动力，是希望在加密货币基金管理内部创造一种归属感和责任感，而不是让所有权完全属于第三方供应商。

    operating manual, a crypto fund should also develop a similar manual, known as

    to an operations manual, the compliance manual could be one large document or
    instead certain areas of compliance could be broken out into smaller stand-alone
    documents as well. This procedure is often followed when several related compliance
    policies are grouped together and spun out into a separate document referred to

- en: As part of the crypto fund trading process, there are often a combination of
    mandatory and voluntary compliance-related checks that must be performed. An example
    of ***pre-trade compliance checks*** from the non-crypto world would be a prohibition
    in countries such as the US on a fund trading on what is known as ***material
    non-public information (MNPI)***. This type of information is also called ***insider
    information*** and trading on it therefore is called ***insider trading***. In
    the US one of the most famous insider trading cases in recent years involved the
    2009 failure of the Galleon Group hedge funds, which had over $7 billion under
    management at its peak, and subsequent conviction of the firm’s founder, Raj Rajaratnam.
    Although some questions have been raised as to whether or not traditional insider
    trading laws apply to the crypto space, many legal experts believe that the insider
    trading laws that have been utilized to prosecute individuals and funds trading
    in more traditional financial securities such as equities are still applicable

  zh: 作为加密基金交易过程的一部分，通常需要执行一些强制性和自愿性的合规性检查。来自非加密世界的***交易前合规检查***的一个例子就是美国等 countries
    对被称为***重大非公开信息 (MNPI)*** 的基金交易实施的禁令。这类信息也被称为***内幕信息***，因此利用这类信息进行的交易被称为***内幕交易***。美国最近几年最著名的内幕交易案件之一涉及Galleon
    Group对冲基金在2009年的破产，该基金在高峰时期管理的资产超过70亿美元，以及随后该公司创始人Raj Rajaratnam的定罪。尽管有人质疑传统内幕交易法律是否适用于加密领域，但许多法律专家认为，已经用于起诉传统金融证券如股票交易的个人的内幕交易法律仍适用于加密领域。[⑥](#FPar1)
- en: Returning to our pre-trade compliance check example, let us assume that a crypto
    manager wanted to ensure that they were not going to be trading in any cryptocurrencies
    in which they could be exposed to risk of insider trading allegations. In this
    case, the crypto fund manager could develop policies in their compliance manual
    related to MNPI including that any employee who believes they have been exposed
    to MNPI should report it to the compliance department who would then add the specific
    cryptocurrencies related to the MNPI to a list of securities that the firm was
    prohibited from trading for a period of time until the compliance department determined
    that the conflicts related to the crypto securities in question had been absolved.
    This type of list is referred to as a ***restricted list***. As part of the pre-trade
    compliance process, the cryptocurrencies on this restricted list can then be cross-referenced
    with potential proposed trades entered into the OMS prior to execution. If there
    is a match, and a proposed trade is entered into a restricted crypto then the
    OMS would automatically send an alert, also called a ***flag*** or ***red flag***.
    The trade would then not be able to proceed as trading in the security is restricted.
    Without this pre-trade compliance check, the trade may have proceeded and the
    crypto fund could have been in violation of insider trading laws or at the very
    least further exposed to unintended compliance risks.

  zh: 回到我们的交易前合规检查例子，假设一个加密基金经理希望确保他们不会交易任何可能面临内幕交易指控的加密货币。在这种情况下，加密基金经理可以在合规手册中制定与MNPI相关的政策，包括任何认为自己接触到MNPI的员工应向合规部门报告，合规部门随后将在一段时间内将特定与MNPI相关的加密货币添加到公司禁止交易的证券列表中，直到合规部门确定与所涉及的加密证券相关的冲突已经解决。这种列表被称为***限制列表***。作为交易前合规过程的一部分，可以将此限制列表与进入OMS的交易潜在建议进行交叉参考。如果存在匹配项，并且建议交易涉及限制性加密货币，则OMS将自动发送警报，也称为***标志***或***红旗***。交易
    then 将无法进行，因为交易受到限制。如果没有这种交易前合规检查，交易可能会继续进行，加密基金可能会违反内幕交易法律，或者至少会进一步暴露于无意中的合规风险。
- en: Another example of a trading compliance check would relate to the concept of
    fund ***position limits***. These are restrictions on the amount that a fund can
    hold of an individual or group of securities with certain predetermined characteristics.
    An example of a position limit could be that no individual cryptocurrency can
    consist of more than 10% of fund AUM. Another example would be that cryptocurrencies
    with a market capitalization of under $100 million cannot constitute more than
    5% of portfolio AUM. Position limit restrictions are often self-imposed by managers
    and detailed in the fund’s offering documentation, however, some specific position
    limits may also be implemented by regulators, and these are often mandatory in
    nature.

    of the firm. Once compliance documentation that outlines the firm’s compliance
    policies and procedures has been drafted, it is then circulated to all employees

    by regulators, for the crypto firm to have each employee sign a document called
    an attestation, where the employee states that they received the compliance manual
    and agree to adhere to the policies outlined therein. The practical problem with
    these attestations is that the crypto fund’s compliance policies and procedures

- en: If any historical presentations are located that are in violation of the compliance
    guidelines (i.e., are not labeled according to the crypto fund’s compliance policies)
    then corrective action could be taken by compliance. The nature of this corrective
    action would likely vary based on both the severity and frequency of the violations.
    For example, if a single violation was noted, then minor corrective action such
    as discussing the violation with the employee responsible for it could be taken.
    If several violations were noted over an extended period of time, then more significant
    corrective action could be taken. Examples of this would be rewriting the compliance
    policies in this area to ensuring more oversight of new presentations and retraining
    the entire business development department on the proper compliance procedures.
    Additionally, when compliance testing demonstrates a number of violations in a
    particular area the testing calendar will generally be revised to conduct more
    frequent testing, as well as surveillance, in the area in which the violations
    occurred to monitor for any future violations more closely. This type of compliance
    testing likely also seeks to monitor for items that are not actual violations
    of compliance policies but rather are approaching violations. These types of almost

    context. One of the most notable examples of such as word that should not be used

    last year. It would not be appropriate for the crypto fund’s personnel to write
    in an email to a prospective or existing client that, “we guarantee our fund will
    return at least 50% next year.” At a minimum, the compliance department would
    want to be made aware when such a word is utilized. It is not practical for the
    compliance department to manually read each email before it is sent, or even read

  zh: 通常，许多加密基金会采用合规政策，这些政策会限制在金融背景下通常不使用的某些众所周知词汇的使用。在客户沟通和演讲中，绝大多数情况下不应该使用的一个非常突出的例子是“保证”这个词。例如，假设一个加密基金去年回报了50%。加密基金的人员在给潜在或现有客户的电子邮件中写“我们保证我们的基金明年至少回报50%”是不合适的。合规部门至少希望在这些词汇使用时被告知。合规部门手动阅读每封在发送前或甚至已经发送的每封电子邮件是不切实际的。这样的工作量可能太大，无法实现规模化。因此，在这种情况下也利用自动化技术进行监控，以监管这些类型的电子通信。

- en: In a crypto-asset management context, fund governance can be defined as an interconnected
    systems of control and procedures that seek to promote independence, transparency
    and oversight.[⁷](#FPar1) Governance comes in many forms in a crypto fund, and
    as noted above the concept of governance is closely related to compliance. From
    a documentation perspective, the compliance policies and procedures of a crypto
    fund will often be a driver of the governance framework in place at a crypto fund.
    A common way that this will take place is through the use of committees. One example
    of firm-wide internal committees at the crypto-asset manager may also have governance-related
    oversight as well. Examples of these can include the compliance committee, operations
    committee, compensation committee, valuation committee and management committee.

  zh: 在加密资产管理的背景下，基金治理可以被定义为一系列寻求促进独立性、透明度和监督的控制和程序的互联系统。[⁷](#FPar1) 在加密基金中，治理有许多形式，正如上面所提到的，治理与合规性密切相关。从文件角度来看，加密基金的合规政策和程序通常会推动加密基金现有的治理框架。这种推动通常会通过委员会的使用来实现。加密资产管理者公司内常见的跨部门内部委员会也可能涉及治理相关的监督。这些委员会可能包括合规委员会、运营委员会、薪酬委员会、估值委员会和管理委员会。
- en: These committees can also be at the fund level themselves. An example of a fund-level
    committee would be a ***board of directors***. Each different fund vehicle managed
    by the crypto fund manager may have a board of directors; however, it is not always
    required, and different jurisdictions have different rules in this regard. Crypto
    fund boards may have a variety of different makeups. In a US context, it is common
    for an offshore board, such as those in the Cayman Islands, to have at least three
    members. In general, it is considered best practice for a fund board to consist
    of both individual that work for the crypto fund (i.e., affiliated members) and
    those that are external to the crypto fund (i.e., unaffiliated members). It is
    also considered best practice for there to be an odd number of directors so that
    there will not be any ties when it comes to votes undertaken by the board. Unaffiliated
    board members may come from a variety of sources and there are specialized service
    providers that have individuals that serve as professional fund directors. A common
    criticism of these professional directors is that these individuals can sit on
    large numbers of fund boards and therefore, they are spread too thin to be able
    to focus on any one fund relationship. To combat these criticisms many fund directorship
    vendors will self-impose limits with regard to the number of boards a single director
    may sit on.

  zh: 这些委员会也可以在基金层面上存在。例如，基金层面的委员会可以是**董事会**。由加密货币基金经理管理的每个不同的基金实体可能都有一个董事会；然而，这并非总是必须的，不同司法管辖区在这方面的规定也不同。加密货币基金董事会可能有各种不同的组成。在美国的情况下，一个位于开曼群岛等海外的董事会通常至少由三名成员组成。通常，被认为最佳实践的是基金董事会应由既为加密货币基金工作（即关联成员）也为加密货币基金外部（即非关联成员）的人组成。被认为是最佳实践的还有董事会成员数量应为奇数，这样在董事会进行投票时就不会有任何平局。非关联董事会成员可能来自各种来源，并且有专门的服务提供商拥有作为专业基金董事的个体。这些专业董事的常见批评是，这些个体可以坐在大量基金董事会，因此他们过于分散，无法专注于任何单一基金关系。为了应对这些批评，许多基金董事服务提供商将自行设定关于单一董事可坐拥董事会数量的限制。

- en: '*Approving tax distributions amounts to GP*—A tax distribution is a distribution
    of money typically made to LPs in order to offset each individual investor''s
    anticipated tax liability related to their investment in the fund. The purpose
    of these payments is to allow investors in a fund to be able to pay taxes related
    to their investment in a fund as opposed to provide them with profits. Tax distributions
    are typically paid by funds within a predetermined period of time, such as 60–90 days
    after the end of the fiscal year of a fund.'

- en: '*Allowing for investment limitations to be overridden*—When a crypto fund is
    formed a number of different investment restrictions may be placed with regard
    to the nature and size of certain investments. An example of this is the concept
    of position limits as we had outlined earlier in this chapter. In certain cases,
    the LPAC may have the right to approve or deny proposed crypto investments that

    event*** refers to a situation that is triggered when a single individual, or
    multiple persons as the case may be, that are essential to the management of a
    crypto fund are no longer able to perform their duties. Common occurrences that
    trigger a key person clause include the death of a key person, their incapacitation,
    if he takes bad actions that are determined to constitute items such as fraud
    or gross negligence, or if he is simply no longer involved in the day-to-day management
    of the fund for an extended period of time. After a key person clause is triggered,
    many crypto fund formation documents contain a provision that the LPs who hold
    that majority of the fund’s interest can vote to cease fund operations or place
    it in limited operations mode. Depending on the specific circumstances LPs may
    decide to pull the fund out of limited operations mode and continue normal investment
    activities. The LPAC may have authority to vote on ceasing fund operations or
    placing the fund into limited operations mode.'

  zh: 结论
- en: This chapter provided an overview of compliance and governance considerations
    for crypto-asset managers. We began this chapter by distinguishing the concepts
    of mandatory and voluntary compliance. Next, we discussed the extent to which
    crypto funds that are not registered with financial regulators may still be subjected
    to regulatory compliance oversight. We then proceeded to analyze in-house versus
    outsourced compliance functions. As part of this conversation, we considered the
    requirements in place for in-house compliance resources at a crypto fund. We then
    proceeded to discuss the development of a crypto fund’s compliance manual and
    Code of Ethics. As part of this conversation, we discussed the concept of crypto
    trading compliance including crypto-related insider trading risks. Compliance
    training was next discussed including an overview of firm-wide compliance training
    as well as department-specific and issue-specific compliance training. Other topics
    discussed in this chapter included compliance testing, surveillance and crypto
    governance mechanisms ranging from the board of directors and the role of the
    Limited Partner Advisory Committee (LPAC). Now that we have established a foundation
    in crypto fund manager compliance, in the next chapter we can expand our compliance
    analysis to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance for cryptocurrencies.
