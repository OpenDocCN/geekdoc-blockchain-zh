    of the industry’s implementation of rigid compliance controls and procedures has
    often played catch up to the inflows of capital into the space. Further contributing
    to lags in the implementation of rigorous compliance throughout the crypto fund
    space has been continued regulatory uncertainty in the space. This uncertainty
    has come across a range of areas from the most basic questions as to whether or
    not the crypto industry should be regulated, and therefore, have basic mandated
    compliance controls to more topic-specific items such as governments struggling
    to boost the rates of crypto tax compliance.[¹](#FPar1)

    has many different applications in the cryptocurrency and digital asset space.
    For example, there are technical applications of compliance in areas such as anti-money
    laundering (AML) compliance. This is covered in Chapter [5](513667_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml).
    Another aspect of compliance and governance is broad adherence to laws and rules
    promulgated by financial regulators and legislators. This will be covered in Chapter
    [6](513667_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml). In this chapter, we will cover the implementation
    of a compliance and governance framework at both the management company and fund

    that a crypto-asset manager must adhere to. This process is known as regulatory
    *rulemaking*.

    by the work of the regulators, mandatory compliance is also referred to as ***regulatory
    compliance***. Another term used for mandatory compliance is ***minimum compliance***
    because mandatory compliance refers to the minimum level of compliance obligations
    that a crypto-asset manager must adhere to in order to operate legally.

    compliance obligations that a crypto-asset manager is not required to follow but
    voluntarily chooses to follow. There are two primary sources of these voluntary
    compliance obligations. The first comes in the form of what is known as ***regulatory
    guidance***. Regulatory guidance is effective advice from regulators as to how
    a certain mandatory practice should be implemented, as well as how compliance
    practices that are not yet mandatory but will likely be mandatory in the future
    should be addressed. Regulators often communicate guidance through methods such
    as speeches at industry conferences and by publishing position statements.

- en: A common point of confusion for many people is whether or not there are any
    mandatory compliance obligations on crypto-asset managers if they meet certain
    regulatory exemptions and therefore, are not required to be registered with a
    financial regulator. The short answer is that even if a crypto fund manager is
    not required to be registered, they are still subject to some form of supervision
    by financial regulators.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most common examples of this would be in the U.S. under the Securities
    and Exchange Commission (SEC) regime. Under sections ***3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of
    the Investment Company Act*** ***of 1940 (‘40 Act)***, there are exemptions, commonly
    referred to as the private adviser exemption, under which a private fund manager
    inclusive of crypto-asset managers, would not be required to registered with the
    SEC. There are several of these exemptions including an exemption for certain
    types of venture capital funds. The original exemptions outlined in the ‘40 Act
    were further restricted by legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Act. While there
    are a number of technicalities to the specific application of the relevant SEC
    registration exemptions available to crypto fund managers, a key metric that is
    often utilized as a gateway issue to determine if a crypto manager would be eligible
    for a registration exemption is tied to the fund manager's assets under management
    (AUM). It is worth noting that for the purposes of determining eligibility with
    the exemption requirements a crypto fund manager's AUM is not always as straightforward
    as net assets or simply adding up the total of all investment capital received.
    Instead, the regulators calculate a number known as ***Regulatory Assets Under
    Management (RAUM)***. RAUM is different from AUM in that it is gross assets, which
    includes leverage, as well as adds in capital that may have been committed but
    not yet called from investors.[³](#FPar1)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a private fund manager has an RAUM of less than $150 million, then they would
    generally be exempt from registering with the US SEC as an ***Investment Adviser
    (IA)***. This $150 million threshold applies on an ongoing basis and not at any
    particular time. For example, if a new crypto fund at launch has $50 million,
    then it would generally be exempt from IA registration. However, if the fund continues
    to raise capital, then once they hit $150 million, they would need to register.
    Similarly, if a crypto fund at launch attracts a great deal of interest from investors
    and will have $200 million on its first day of trading then it would need to register
    as an IA at launch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With an understanding of this framework in place we can now return to our original
    question of if a crypto-asset manager is below $150 million in RAUM, and therefore
    subject to SEC exemption, does this mean that they have no mandatory compliance
    requirements under the SEC? The answer is no. Even if a crypto fund is exempt,
    they still may be subject to reporting requirements. These types of exempt managers
    are therefore referred to not as IAs but Exempt Reporting Advisers (ERAs). A common
    form ERAs are required to file is US SEC Form ADV Part (1)(A).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also important to note that in addition to reporting requirements, exempt
    crypto funds are also still subjected to a number of laws and rules that apply
    regardless of their registration status. An example of this would be restrictions
    on political donations given by a fund manager in order to secure business from
    the government, commonly known as the pay-to-play rule.[⁴](#FPar1) Additionally,
    simply because a crypto manager is exempt, this does not mean that they could
    not be subjected to examinations or be required to respond to information requests
    from regulators in much the same way that a registered entity would be required
    to respond to these items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also important to keep in mind that regardless of any requirements for
    registration or exemption that may apply to a crypto-asset manager at the federal
    government level, such as with the SEC, there may also be different regional requirements
    for managers to register. In the US the example of this would be a requirement
    for a crypto-asset manager to register at the state level with the financial regulatory
    authority. State-level regulators may have additional regulations and reporting
    requirements that the crypto fund may need to adhere to as well.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that we have established the two different types of compliance obligations,
    we can next discuss who is actually responsible for implementing and overseeing
    the compliance function at a crypto manager. When managing a crypto fund certain
    activities are performed by the employees of the fund manager and certain activities
    can be outsourced to third parties. As we introduced in Chapter [1](513667_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml),
    these third parties are commonly called ***vendors*** or ***service providers***.
    From a compliance perspective, the activities performed by employees of the fund
    are referred to as ***in-house compliance resources***. This is as compared to
    those compliance activities performed by third-party vendors external to the fund,
    that are known as ***outsourced compliance resources***.

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a practical perspective, it is not considered best practice for a crypto
    fund to entirely outsource their compliance function to third-party service providers.
    A key reason for this is because by maintaining in-house ownership of compliance
    resources, the thinking is that the crypto fund will be more directly involved
    in ongoing compliance management. From a regulatory perspective, the vast majority
    of jurisdictions where crypto fund managers are likely to be based will be in
    locations where the financial regulators require the crypto fund to maintain an
    in-house ***Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)***. A CCO is the individual who is
    responsible for overseeing the compliance function at a crypto fund. An example
    of such a requirement in the UK is the requirement by the Financial Conduct Authority
    (FCA) for certain classes of crypto funds to maintain a CCO that holds the CF
    10 Compliance Oversight Function designation. Another example of this type of
    requirement is in the US for registered crypto funds to maintain a CCO is in SEC
    Rule 206(4)-7 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be clear this does not mean that a crypto fund cannot utilize third-party
    vendors to assist in the compliance function. What these regulatory rules mean
    is that an employee of the crypto fund itself must be designated as the CCO. You
    may be asking what is the purpose of an in-house designated CCO, if all the compliance
    work is outsourced? The purpose of requiring a in-house employee of the crypto
    asset manager to be designated as CCO is to make someone who is in-house directly
    accountable for ensuring that the compliance function is properly implemented
    and maintained. The motivating force behind this in-house CCO model therefore,
    is to create a sense of ownership and accountability within the crypto fund manager
    itself as opposed to having the ownership lie exclusively with third-party vendors.

    operating manual, a crypto fund should also develop a similar manual, known as
    a ***compliance manual***, outlining compliance policies and procedures. Similar
    to an operations manual, the compliance manual could be one large document or
    instead certain areas of compliance could be broken out into smaller stand-alone
    documents as well. This procedure is often followed when several related compliance
    policies are grouped together and spun out into a separate document referred to
    as a ***Code of Ethics***.

    surrounding the crypto trading process for fund managers. As part of that discussion,
    we referenced the use of trading order management systems (OMS) to facilitate
    pre-trade compliance checks. In this section, we will now expand upon more specifics
    related to the purpose and types of pre- and post-trade compliance policies and
    procedures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As part of the crypto fund trading process, there are often a combination of
    mandatory and voluntary compliance-related checks that must be performed. An example
    of ***pre-trade compliance checks*** from the non-crypto world would be a prohibition
    in countries such as the US on a fund trading on what is known as ***material
    non-public information (MNPI)***. This type of information is also called ***insider
    information*** and trading on it therefore is called ***insider trading***. In
    the US one of the most famous insider trading cases in recent years involved the
    2009 failure of the Galleon Group hedge funds, which had over $7 billion under
    management at its peak, and subsequent conviction of the firm’s founder, Raj Rajaratnam.
    Although some questions have been raised as to whether or not traditional insider
    trading laws apply to the crypto space, many legal experts believe that the insider
    trading laws that have been utilized to prosecute individuals and funds trading
    in more traditional financial securities such as equities are still applicable
    to crypto.[⁶](#FPar1)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Returning to our pre-trade compliance check example, let us assume that a crypto
    manager wanted to ensure that they were not going to be trading in any cryptocurrencies
    in which they could be exposed to risk of insider trading allegations. In this
    case, the crypto fund manager could develop policies in their compliance manual
    related to MNPI including that any employee who believes they have been exposed
    to MNPI should report it to the compliance department who would then add the specific
    cryptocurrencies related to the MNPI to a list of securities that the firm was
    prohibited from trading for a period of time until the compliance department determined
    that the conflicts related to the crypto securities in question had been absolved.
    This type of list is referred to as a ***restricted list***. As part of the pre-trade
    compliance process, the cryptocurrencies on this restricted list can then be cross-referenced
    with potential proposed trades entered into the OMS prior to execution. If there
    is a match, and a proposed trade is entered into a restricted crypto then the
    OMS would automatically send an alert, also called a ***flag*** or ***red flag***.
    The trade would then not be able to proceed as trading in the security is restricted.
    Without this pre-trade compliance check, the trade may have proceeded and the
    crypto fund could have been in violation of insider trading laws or at the very
    least further exposed to unintended compliance risks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example of a trading compliance check would relate to the concept of
    fund ***position limits***. These are restrictions on the amount that a fund can
    hold of an individual or group of securities with certain predetermined characteristics.
    An example of a position limit could be that no individual cryptocurrency can
    consist of more than 10% of fund AUM. Another example would be that cryptocurrencies
    with a market capitalization of under $100 million cannot constitute more than
    5% of portfolio AUM. Position limit restrictions are often self-imposed by managers
    and detailed in the fund’s offering documentation, however, some specific position
    limits may also be implemented by regulators, and these are often mandatory in
    nature.

    such as a compliance manual, the next step is to implement the compliance function.
    A key part of this process is providing ***compliance training*** to employees
    of the firm. Once compliance documentation that outlines the firm’s compliance
    policies and procedures has been drafted, it is then circulated to all employees
    of the crypto firm. It is considered best practice, and in many cases often required
    by regulators, for the crypto firm to have each employee sign a document called
    an attestation, where the employee states that they received the compliance manual
    and agree to adhere to the policies outlined therein. The practical problem with
    these attestations is that the crypto fund’s compliance policies and procedures
    are often quite long and technical in detail and may not be easily understood
    by employees. Additionally, while compliance manuals tend to be quite long, they
    may not get into sufficient detail to properly address the specific compliance
    protocols and challenges involved in every employee’s job.

    compliance procedures should be implemented. To address these types of challenges,
    it is therefore considered helpful for crypto firms to conduct compliance training
    sessions. For a new crypto firm, all employees would typically undergo an initial
    training session. Additional compliance training would then also be implemented
    for new employees as they join the firm. Specifically, there are three types of
    ongoing training for employees after their initial training sessions. The first
    type is what is known as firm-wide compliance training.

    would not likely interact with prospective clients as part of their daily trading
    activities. Similarly, department-specific compliance training for the trading
    department of a crypto fund would cover more trading-focused compliance such as
    the above referenced prohibitions surrounding trading on MNPI. These types of

    topic may take place as these employees may utilize social media as part of the

    together, but they are distinct concepts.
  prefs: []

- en: The term ***compliance testing*** refers to when a backward-looking audit is
    conducted to determine the efficacy of the implementation of the compliance policies
    at the crypto fund. This can be compared to ***compliance surveillance*** that
    refers to an ongoing monitoring, either in real-time or close to real-time, to
    determine if a crypto fund’s day-to-day investment and operational activities
    are either in adherence or violation of the firm’s compliance policies and procedures.
    In practice, many compliance departments develop a testing calendar which they
    use throughout the year to roll through different compliance topics to test.

- en: We can look at a specific compliance area to cover an example of the way testing
    would work in practice. For our example, let us consider the business development
    function. Let us assume that a crypto fund’s compliance procedures outline that
    all presentations made for new clients must be labeled according to a numbering
    system and with the prospective client’s name. To test if the business development
    department was adhering to these procedures a test could be performed by pulling
    a randomly selected percentage of new client presentations created over a predetermined
    period of time, such as during the last since months.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If any historical presentations are located that are in violation of the compliance
    guidelines (i.e., are not labeled according to the crypto fund’s compliance policies)
    then corrective action could be taken by compliance. The nature of this corrective
    action would likely vary based on both the severity and frequency of the violations.
    For example, if a single violation was noted, then minor corrective action such
    as discussing the violation with the employee responsible for it could be taken.
    If several violations were noted over an extended period of time, then more significant
    corrective action could be taken. Examples of this would be rewriting the compliance
    policies in this area to ensuring more oversight of new presentations and retraining
    the entire business development department on the proper compliance procedures.
    Additionally, when compliance testing demonstrates a number of violations in a
    particular area the testing calendar will generally be revised to conduct more
    frequent testing, as well as surveillance, in the area in which the violations
    occurred to monitor for any future violations more closely. This type of compliance
    testing likely also seeks to monitor for items that are not actual violations
    of compliance policies but rather are approaching violations. These types of almost
    violations are referred to as ***yellow flag items*** or ***near-misses***.

    firm facilitates ongoing testing. This is largely because compliance surveillance
    is largely automated in nature through the use of technology. Certain areas of
    a crypto-asset manager are more amenable to this automated surveillance. One of
    the most common areas for compliance surveillance is trading. As outlined above,
    an automated surveillance system could produce flag alerts in the event of a potential
    violation in areas such as restricted list compliance. Once a flag was raised,
    the compliance department could then investigate the nature of this potential
    violation and take corrective action if necessary. Another example of an area
    of a firm that facilitates the use of automated compliance surveillance is with
    regard to electronic communication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Commonly, many crypto funds will employ compliance policies that would restrict
    the use of certain well-known words that are typically not utilized in a financial
    context. One of the most notable examples of such as word that should not be used
    in the vast majority of instances in client communications and presentations is
    the word, “guarantee.” For example, let’s say that a crypto fund returned 50%
    last year. It would not be appropriate for the crypto fund’s personnel to write
    in an email to a prospective or existing client that, “we guarantee our fund will
    return at least 50% next year.” At a minimum, the compliance department would
    want to be made aware when such a word is utilized. It is not practical for the
    compliance department to manually read each email before it is sent, or even read
    every email sent out. The volume is likely too much to be scalable. As such, automated
    technologies are utilized to conduct surveillance to monitor electronic communications
    in these types of situations as well.

- en: In a crypto-asset management context, fund governance can be defined as an interconnected
    systems of control and procedures that seek to promote independence, transparency
    and oversight.[⁷](#FPar1) Governance comes in many forms in a crypto fund, and
    as noted above the concept of governance is closely related to compliance. From
    a documentation perspective, the compliance policies and procedures of a crypto
    fund will often be a driver of the governance framework in place at a crypto fund.
    A common way that this will take place is through the use of committees. One example
    of firm-wide internal committees at the crypto-asset manager may also have governance-related
    oversight as well. Examples of these can include the compliance committee, operations
    committee, compensation committee, valuation committee and management committee.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These committees can also be at the fund level themselves. An example of a fund-level
    committee would be a ***board of directors***. Each different fund vehicle managed
    by the crypto fund manager may have a board of directors; however, it is not always
    required, and different jurisdictions have different rules in this regard. Crypto
    fund boards may have a variety of different makeups. In a US context, it is common
    for an offshore board, such as those in the Cayman Islands, to have at least three
    members. In general, it is considered best practice for a fund board to consist
    of both individual that work for the crypto fund (i.e., affiliated members) and
    those that are external to the crypto fund (i.e., unaffiliated members). It is
    also considered best practice for there to be an odd number of directors so that
    there will not be any ties when it comes to votes undertaken by the board. Unaffiliated
    board members may come from a variety of sources and there are specialized service
    providers that have individuals that serve as professional fund directors. A common
    criticism of these professional directors is that these individuals can sit on
    large numbers of fund boards and therefore, they are spread too thin to be able
    to focus on any one fund relationship. To combat these criticisms many fund directorship
    vendors will self-impose limits with regard to the number of boards a single director
    may sit on.

    that majority of the fund’s interest can vote to cease fund operations or place
    it in limited operations mode. Depending on the specific circumstances LPs may

- en: This chapter provided an overview of compliance and governance considerations
    for crypto-asset managers. We began this chapter by distinguishing the concepts
    of mandatory and voluntary compliance. Next, we discussed the extent to which
    crypto funds that are not registered with financial regulators may still be subjected
    to regulatory compliance oversight. We then proceeded to analyze in-house versus
    outsourced compliance functions. As part of this conversation, we considered the
    requirements in place for in-house compliance resources at a crypto fund. We then
    proceeded to discuss the development of a crypto fund’s compliance manual and
    Code of Ethics. As part of this conversation, we discussed the concept of crypto
    trading compliance including crypto-related insider trading risks. Compliance
    training was next discussed including an overview of firm-wide compliance training
    as well as department-specific and issue-specific compliance training. Other topics
    discussed in this chapter included compliance testing, surveillance and crypto
    governance mechanisms ranging from the board of directors and the role of the
    Limited Partner Advisory Committee (LPAC). Now that we have established a foundation
    in crypto fund manager compliance, in the next chapter we can expand our compliance
    analysis to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance for cryptocurrencies.
