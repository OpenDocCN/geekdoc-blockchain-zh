    number of actual blockchain deployments in enterprises is scarce. Only 1 percent

    were engaged in short-term planning or active experimentation with it. Furthermore,
    77 percent said they had no plans to investigate it further.

    many believe that, for various reasons, they will be generally immune to patent
    risks with the technology. Kaufman cautions that that assumption is wrong and
    that working with blockchain technology could be like walking through a minefield
    of patents. According to him, “A lot of parties are filing a lot of patent applications
    to cover a lot of aspects of blockchain technology.”

    especially early on, purposely did not seek patents,” Kaufman explains.

    around 2013 or 2014, when the technology really started to explode, this started
    to change. At first, we started to see a small number of filings. But since then,
    the increase in the numbers of patent publications worldwide has really taken
    off. In 2018, we saw over 2800 new patent families published worldwide. According
    to a conservative prediction, we will see 4,600 new patent families related to
    blockchain technology published in 2019\. We have observed almost exponential
    growth in blockchain patent filings since 2013\. I don’t see a reason why it would
    slow down any time soon.

    word “web” for the first time, but no one could explain to me what it was, much
    less how it would transform my life and become essential to nearly every aspect
    of being alive. But by the year 2000, when the Internet was emerging as the hottest
    trend and I was a college student in search of a distraction, I took a few minutes
    to download funny cat pictures at the UC Berkeley library. And now, just 15 years
    later, my life would most definitely be incomplete—and likely impossible—without
    the Internet. In fact, I get frustrated when my video streaming slows down for

    pace, the benefits of this complex technology are still a bit too abstract and
    removed from the average pedestrian. In sum, these are still early days. You are
