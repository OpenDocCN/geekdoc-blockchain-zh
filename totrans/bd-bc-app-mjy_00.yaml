- en: When I recently reconnected with Dr. Michael Yuan, he had just completed successfully
    fundraising for his blockchain project CyberMiles ($CMT), which later spun off
    a technology company called Second State. Dr. Yuan was staying at the forefront
    of blockchain technology and financing. I thought back to the way he had first
    described the core technical underpinnings of Blockchain for CMT, in a remarkable
    technical white paper, and how it had resonated with my own middleware architecture
    experience and understanding at the time. He was speaking a language I understood.
    Remarkably, the vision he had first laid out is being realized in Second State
    and applied to the enterprise blockchain markets.

    2000s, which is how we got to first meet. Open source software had gone from pariah
    status in late 1999 (“a cancer”) to the very bedrock of the Internet. By 2008
    “open source money,” as the Bitcoin concept was first called by its semi-anonymous
    authors, became public. What is remarkable about Bitcoin is that no one “owns
    it,” including any corporation or nation-state. It exists as an open source program
    on the Internet. Cryptocurrencies are the first killer app of open source ledgers
    as Internet-centric digital stores of value. It bears repeating that Bitcoin is
    so special in a way because it is not owned or operated by a single entity but
    in a sense is a decentralized property of the Internet. It is an open source program.
    The software implementation is under MIT Licenses (open source), which invites
    anyone with enough power to come, hash it out, and secure the network. As a result,
    the operators tend to cluster around cheap sources of power around the world because
    of the peculiar mathematics (the nuances of Bitcoin) required to secure the network.
    And it has come to pass that stores of value emerged *ex-nihilo* as open source
    crypto ledgers, the first killer app of the technology.

    the crypto financing landscape. Remarkable capital formation dynamics appeared,
    again ex-nihilism, in the ERC20 realm. The ICO phenomenon has established behind
    the shadow of a doubt that crypto asset capital markets have the capacity to revolutionize
    financing in general. It is marking a generational shift. The financial applications
    of cryptocurrencies are in their infancy; they are only ten years old, and the
    limits of this Internet money are more psychological than technical.

    Ledger Technology) that show even more promise in the future. Take, for example,
    the notions of (sovereign) identity and medical data attached to said identity.
    Today we can envision an Internet-centric (meaning decentralized) ID repository
    of properly secured and private biometric data. Let’s not forget that DLTs are
    distributed Internet-centric secured databases. For all you know, the DLT you
    are storing data with lives in generic cell phones with cheap algos. Instead of
    relying on a government to issue and validate identity, we now have within technical
    reach the notion of “internet Identity” in many onboarding applications. A video
    conference with trusted parties is enough to establish identity with a high level
    of trust. Many startups propose to offer this implementation of identity. To this
    identity one can attach medical data. This medical data, again philosophically,
    ultimately belongs to the individual. Technically speaking, distributed ledger
    technologies allow this to exist and, as a society, to reach for “earth-wide,
    Internet-centric” data constructs. The open source future is bright.

    by advances in ledger technology. Accounting, for all its boring reputation, seems
    to be essential to mankind’s progress. For example, in post-Revolution France,
    Napoleon used centralized ledgers, maintained centrally by a nation-state, written
    on paper, for the purpose of raising an army. IBM, the iconic American corporation,
    was born out of the late nineteenth century nationwide census in the United States.
    Punch cards were developed to tally the people across the vast continent. The
    counting problem led an engineering feat and the birth of Big Blue. The generations
    to come will use DLT in a variety of ways we cannot foresee today.

- en: 'But back to the present and Dr. Yuan. Michael and his focus on tooling for
    the smart contract ecosystem are insightful, informed, and timely. In this book,
    he quickly takes you down the ETH development path. Dapps are used here as concrete
    examples. The developer can quickly get to programming productivity, which is
    essential in this fast-moving ecosystem. This book is technical and covers many
    high-level aspects, including tokenomics. It is aimed at the practitioner and
    will take you through the steps to install your development environment and start
    BUIDLing a dapp. Go beyond the financial apps of DLTs and tap the vast potential
    smart contracts have to offer for the next generation of killer apps. The state
    of tools and indeed virtual machines in the DLT domain is rapidly evolving, and
    this book offers a comprehensive development introduction for the professional
    developer. HODL and BUIDL: The future is bright.'
