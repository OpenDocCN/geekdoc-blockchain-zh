- en: When I recently reconnected with Dr. Michael Yuan, he had just completed successfully
    fundraising for his blockchain project CyberMiles ($CMT), which later spun off
    a technology company called Second State. Dr. Yuan was staying at the forefront
    of blockchain technology and financing. I thought back to the way he had first
    described the core technical underpinnings of Blockchain for CMT, in a remarkable
    technical white paper, and how it had resonated with my own middleware architecture
    experience and understanding at the time. He was speaking a language I understood.
    Remarkably, the vision he had first laid out is being realized in Second State
    and applied to the enterprise blockchain markets.

  zh: 当我最近与迈克尔·袁博士重新取得联系时，他刚刚成功地为他的区块链项目CyberMiles ($CMT)完成了筹款，该项目后来又分离出了一家名为Second
    State的技术公司。袁博士一直站在区块链技术和融资的前沿。我想起了他最初是如何在一份技术白皮书里描述CMT的区块链核心技术的，那与我当时的中间件架构经验和理解产生了共鸣。他说的话我能听懂。令人印象深刻的是，他最初提出的愿景正在Second
    State得到实现，并应用于企业区块链市场。
- en: Dr. Yuan was an avid proponent of open source decentralization in the early
    2000s, which is how we got to first meet. Open source software had gone from pariah
    status in late 1999 (“a cancer”) to the very bedrock of the Internet. By 2008
    “open source money,” as the Bitcoin concept was first called by its semi-anonymous
    authors, became public. What is remarkable about Bitcoin is that no one “owns
    it,” including any corporation or nation-state. It exists as an open source program
    on the Internet. Cryptocurrencies are the first killer app of open source ledgers
    as Internet-centric digital stores of value. It bears repeating that Bitcoin is
    so special in a way because it is not owned or operated by a single entity but
    in a sense is a decentralized property of the Internet. It is an open source program.
    The software implementation is under MIT Licenses (open source), which invites
    anyone with enough power to come, hash it out, and secure the network. As a result,
    the operators tend to cluster around cheap sources of power around the world because
    of the peculiar mathematics (the nuances of Bitcoin) required to secure the network.
    And it has come to pass that stores of value emerged *ex-nihilo* as open source
    crypto ledgers, the first killer app of the technology.

  zh: 袁博士是2000年代初开放源代码去中心化的热烈倡导者，这就是我们第一次见面的方式。开源软件从1999年末的“癌症”地位变成了互联网的基石。到了2008年，比特币概念最初被称为“开源货币”公开出现。比特币的特别之处在于没有人“拥有”它，包括任何公司或国家实体。它作为互联网上的一个开源程序存在。加密货币是开源账本作为以互联网为中心的数字价值储存的第一款杀手级应用。需要重复的是，比特币之所以特别，是因为它不是由单一实体拥有或运营，从某种意义上说，它是互联网的分布式财产。它是一个开源程序。软件实现受到MIT许可证（开源）的保护，邀请任何有足够力量的人来参与，解决分歧，并保障网络的安全。因此，运营商往往聚集在全球各地便宜的能源周围，因为保障网络需要解决复杂的数学问题（比特币的细微差别）。结果是，作为开源加密账本的价值储存从无到有出现，这是这项技术的首款杀手级应用。
- en: The introduction of Ethereum and the concept of smart contracts have revolutionized
    the crypto financing landscape. Remarkable capital formation dynamics appeared,
    again ex-nihilism, in the ERC20 realm. The ICO phenomenon has established behind
    the shadow of a doubt that crypto asset capital markets have the capacity to revolutionize
    financing in general. It is marking a generational shift. The financial applications
    of cryptocurrencies are in their infancy; they are only ten years old, and the
    limits of this Internet money are more psychological than technical.

  zh: 以太坊的引入和智能合约的概念彻底改变了加密融资的格局。在ERC20领域，资本形成的动态再次从无到有，ICO现象在无疑问的阴影下确立了加密资产资本市场具有改变融资方式的能力。它标志着一代人的转变。加密货币的金融应用还处于起步阶段；它们只有十岁，这种互联网货币的局限更多的是心理上的而不是技术上的。
- en: However, it is perhaps the more philosophical applications of DLTs (Decentralized
    Ledger Technology) that show even more promise in the future. Take, for example,
    the notions of (sovereign) identity and medical data attached to said identity.
    Today we can envision an Internet-centric (meaning decentralized) ID repository
    of properly secured and private biometric data. Let’s not forget that DLTs are
    distributed Internet-centric secured databases. For all you know, the DLT you
    are storing data with lives in generic cell phones with cheap algos. Instead of
    relying on a government to issue and validate identity, we now have within technical
    reach the notion of “internet Identity” in many onboarding applications. A video
    conference with trusted parties is enough to establish identity with a high level
    of trust. Many startups propose to offer this implementation of identity. To this
    identity one can attach medical data. This medical data, again philosophically,
    ultimately belongs to the individual. Technically speaking, distributed ledger
    technologies allow this to exist and, as a society, to reach for “earth-wide,
    Internet-centric” data constructs. The open source future is bright.

    by advances in ledger technology. Accounting, for all its boring reputation, seems
    to be essential to mankind’s progress. For example, in post-Revolution France,
    Napoleon used centralized ledgers, maintained centrally by a nation-state, written
    on paper, for the purpose of raising an army. IBM, the iconic American corporation,
    was born out of the late nineteenth century nationwide census in the United States.
    Punch cards were developed to tally the people across the vast continent. The
    counting problem led an engineering feat and the birth of Big Blue. The generations
    to come will use DLT in a variety of ways we cannot foresee today.

- en: 'But back to the present and Dr. Yuan. Michael and his focus on tooling for
    the smart contract ecosystem are insightful, informed, and timely. In this book,
    he quickly takes you down the ETH development path. Dapps are used here as concrete
    examples. The developer can quickly get to programming productivity, which is
    essential in this fast-moving ecosystem. This book is technical and covers many
    high-level aspects, including tokenomics. It is aimed at the practitioner and
    will take you through the steps to install your development environment and start
    BUIDLing a dapp. Go beyond the financial apps of DLTs and tap the vast potential
    smart contracts have to offer for the next generation of killer apps. The state
    of tools and indeed virtual machines in the DLT domain is rapidly evolving, and
    this book offers a comprehensive development introduction for the professional
    developer. HODL and BUIDL: The future is bright.'
