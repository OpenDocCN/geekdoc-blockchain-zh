    immutable than others given their structure and governance. Ethereum, the second
    largest cryptocurrency system by market cap after Bitcoin, with arguably one of
    the most vibrant developer communities, decided to alter their blockchain in 2016\.
    A project from within the Ethereum community to set up a decentralized autonomous
    organization (DAO) was introduced, whereby governance over the system and community
    was to be integrated into the blockchain itself. In the process, however, a bug
    was introduced into the blockchain that allowed a hacker to siphon off US$50 million.
    Rather than allow the hack to persist (and due in large part to the fact that
    many of the investors in the DAO were also part of the governance structure of
    the system), the Ethereum community decided to fix the bug and “roll back” the
    blockchain to a state that existed prior to the hack—a state in which the transactions
    of the hacker did not exist and effectively restoring the siphoned monies to their
    original owners. In short, even the Ethereum blockchain is no longer considered

    at sea, sometimes multiple times. Legal cargoes can be topped up with illegal
    oil and customs officers are none the wiser when the blended cargo is landed.

    implement a fertilizer distribution system, following in the footsteps of most

    of their boosted crop yields. But, as with any situation where the government

    can fiddle records in order to sell subsidized fertilizer at the full market price

    or anything else, without any file size or file quantity limitations. This fingerprint
    is then hashed and added to a Factom blockchain. The protocol then anchors its
    chains in the Bitcoin public blockchain, piggy-backing off Bitcoin’s security
    and immutability. The result is an immutable, auditable imprint of the file’s
    contents and existence at a specific point in time. Users of the system can use
    this fingerprint to create an irrefutable audit trail of their data for purposes
    of compliance, anti-fraud and other use cases.

- en: Our experience in Honduras (see Chap. 6) serves to illustrate the challenges.
    The Factom protocol was to be used to digitize the Honduran property records,
    but the project stalled due to political turmoil. After that, we backed off dealing
    with governments and focused instead on loan origination. Coming out of the 2008
    financial crisis, many mortgage lenders were fined billions of dollars for loan
    documentation failures. We focused on documenting the process in a cryptographically
    secure, immutable fashion. However, we quickly discovered that any mistake is
    then cryptographically provable as well. We tried to deal with the issue by providing
    methods to then amend the record. We were able to sell the idea that, in the long
    run, this provides for a cheaper, more efficient system. But the institutional
    fear of liability for mistakes proved to be a persistent barrier to adoption.
    The detail in documenting a process was viewed as carrying unknown risks.

    to track the integrity of video surveillance data. The firm is also in the early
    stages of piloting a system to manage certificates and licenses for raw material
    imports that ensures the provenance of issued credentials, also for DHS.^([8](#Fn8))

    lives. Think of your driver’s license. When entering a bar, you present your ID,
    which includes your name, address, even whether or not you need to wear glasses
    when driving. All of that data is shared in addition to the key data element,
    your birthdate. But even your birthdate has unrequired data, as the bouncer only
    needs to know if you are above a certain age, not your exact date of birth. In
    a blockchain-based system, the identity data provided ensures cryptographic proof
    of accuracy and can be audited by a third party if need be.

    Bad implementation of digital identities is possible. Take the driver’s licence
    example. Even in a blockchain-based system, the government manages the rules that
    govern who is authorized to drive a vehicle. The technology does not protect against
    the government choosing to share, say, your address with the bar you are going
    to, allowing that bar to then market to you. In fact, the technology might not
    just allow this; it may enforce this without your direct knowledge or consent.

    and privacy that we are just beginning to work through and understand. Once upon
    a time, when people earned gold and silver coins, and spent gold and silver coins,
    the only records of transactions would be in ledgers, kept by businesses or people.
    This system of transactions and records provided by its very nature an expectation
    of privacy.

    guarding against search and seizure without a warrant, the records of transactions
    between parties are not just held by the parties, but the definitive records are
    held by banks, payment processors and increasingly by mobile app providers. In
    the US, the Bank Secrecy Act established that an expectation of privacy does not
    exist if the books are kept by third parties like banks and payment processors
    and not solely by the business or person themselves. While businesses and persons
    continue to have privacy in their contracts and agreements, once a transaction
    occurs through the banking and financial system, privacy ends.

    banking and financial system to report those transactions as they occur to the
    government, even if no legally defensible suspicion of a crime exists. This is
    because what activates a “suspicious activity report” can simply be a dollar amount,
    divorced from any context. Governments are increasingly eliminating economic privacy
    in the name of protecting the people.

    in commerce. Governments are moving to outlaw such technologies solely because
    it limits the government’s ability to ignore privacy rights. The goal is to manage
    economic activity in general, while justifying these actions in the name of protecting
    the people.
