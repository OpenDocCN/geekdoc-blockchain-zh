- en: Emotion is a collection of psychological states that includes subjective experience,
    expressive behaviors and peripheral physiological responses. They play a vital
    role in the process of creation, natural communications in day-to-day activity.
    Various physiological signals can measure these emotions. Among the biomedical
    signals, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are more useful in the analysis
    of emotions because emotions are the end product of our thinking, feeling, actions,
    reactions to people and circumstances. In the research of emotion recognition,
    one of the crucial challenges is to elicit a person’s target emotion and collect
    the EEG signal in the laboratory. This work is fruitful for researchers who surveyed
    the methods of emotion recognition using EEG. In this chapter, we have applied
    machine learning and neural network methods for emotions recognition. We have
    described EEG signals, preprocessing techniques, feature extraction and classification
    techniques used for emotion recognition. It is observed that machine learning
    methods are predominant in getting high-level features automatically from noninvasive
    EEG signals and they are less dependent on manually created features.

    perception, interaction and decision-making ability along with human intelligence
    [[1](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_001), [2](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_002)]. However,
    they were ignored by human–computer interaction (HCI) systems till the last decade.
    The HCI systems and digital media find potential applications in biomedical engineering,
    neuroscience, neuromarketing and other alternate areas of life, which are mainly
    affected by emotions. Hence, with the increasing demand for HCI, automatic human
    emotion recognition is gaining researchers’ attention. The emotion recognition
    can be done with text, speech, gesture movements and facial expressions, but electroencephalogram
    (electroencephalography (EEG)) gives a better outcome as it directly measures
    true feelings [[3](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_003), [4](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_004)].
    Rapid development in new wearable, handy, low-cost wireless headsets measuring
    EEG and classification of EEG signals without trained professionals has enormously
    increased its use, like sleep, management and much further combinational arrangement
    for signals. Emotion reorganization plays an important role in today’s era for
    research in medical finding for illness issues caused for illness. Further, the
    advanced signal investigation through feature extraction also holds much application
    in medical image processing. In emotion reorganization research, the basic challenges
    are elicited target emotion and collecting EEG signal in the research laboratory.
    This kind of emotion is generally stimulated with signals like audio, video, text
    and image [[5](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_005), [6](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_006)].
    For stability is concerned, the video among these four signals provides more stability.
    The general brain–computer interface (BCI) system is shown in [Figure 9.1](#b_9783110702507-009_fig_001).

    with rapidly enhancing emotions of Human Machine Interface (HMI) [[10](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_010)].
    Automated retrieval of emotional insist from physiological signals like EEG is
    gaining noticeable usability in the current trend, as computing in the context
    of human neural responses can lead to development of BCIs. The designed BCIs can
    be further programmed toward the development of neuroscientific and premedical
    aspects that progressively contribute to help out medically challenged people
    suffering from certain psychiatric/depression disorders. The emotion recognition
    process is shown in [Figure 9.2](#b_9783110702507-009_fig_002). Therefore, the
    development of a competent computer-aided method for advanced automated classification
    and detection of emotions is based on human response.

    samples for a set of training types. To solve the problems of overfitting and
    increase the accuracy of classification of CSP-based approaches, select few CSP
    features and neglect others, resulting in the loss of differentiating information.
    The algorithm performs FWR (feature weightings and regulation), which replaces
    some method based on the CSP method. It is applied to CSP, common spatiospectral
    patterns and regularized CSP on EEG data. The FWR method gives better classification
    accuracy than previous methods.

    transform for adaptive data decomposition using nonlinear NI EEG signals and nonstationary
    signals. For system execution time reduction and simplicity, 18 channels were
    chosen among 118 channels. Ten frequency-adaptive modes were obtained from each
    channel, and Welch power spectral density was used to find the most sensitive
    mode. Hilbert transform was applied on this mode to get the instantaneous frequency
    and instantaneous amplitude (IF and IA) features and fed to the LS-SVM classifier.
    Accuracy on BCI IV IIa dataset with IA and IF features was 95.19% and 94.6%, respectively.
    Zhang et al. [[7](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_007)] mention that interferences due
    to artifacts were removed in feature extraction by using the AR-CSP algorithm.
    The nonstationarity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) was resolved in a classifier
    with the method known as self-regulated supervised Gaussian fuzzy adaptive system
    art method. This algorithm selected samples on a priority basis and directly upgraded
    the fuzzy rules. The system has resolved the problem of overtraining and can be
    used in general.

    limitations that affect the analysis of a signal. If we compared signal-to-noise
    ratio, EEG has very little because it measures the brain activity mixed with artifacts.
    Hence, filtering and noise reduction techniques should be used to extract actual
    brain signal out of raw EEG. The EEG is a nonstationary signal [[7](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_007)]
    that varies across time varying signals. Hence, classifier trained on a limited
    amount of user data may poorly classify generalized data recorded for the same
    individual.

    varying magnitudes. This seriously affects the performance of the algorithms that
    are developed to generalize across the subjects, which in turn limits the use
    of EEG applications. To solve some of the problems mentioned above, domain-specific
    approaches are widely used, which has reduced the flexibility and generalization
    capability of the system.

    sophisticated knowledge is required about the dataset for its better performance.
    This property of deep learning has made it popular in the field of medical applications
    [[26](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_026)] involving large datasets that are otherwise

    preferred to achieve good results with the limited amount of data. It was observed
    that data augmentation had improved the performance of classification; still,
    more work is required to access the advantages of deep learning [[25](#b_9783110702507-009_ref_025)].
    One of the main reasons for using a deep neural network was to use raw EEG for
    classification. The deep learning algorithms can be generalized across subjects
    and facilitate learning across the tasks. The popularity of CNN shows a trend
    of using raw EEG compared to extracted features. The ability of CNN to use spatial
    and temporal features has given the remarkable improvement inaccuracy.

- en: The design of deep learning classification extensively depends on input formulation
    and network design. Various studies have been done so far related to BCI competition
    to compare classification outcome-based accuracy. Different deep learning techniques
    have their advantages as well as disadvantages. It is observed that by applying
    CNN’s method, the performance of deep networks such as Clued Attention Recurrent
    Model (CRAM) and fuzzy deep belief networks will improve. This chapter shows that
    the success of training a deep neural architecture is still not completely known.
    Design and characteristic novel architecture for feature extraction of EEG signal
    using CNN and emotion recognition have been demonstrated.
