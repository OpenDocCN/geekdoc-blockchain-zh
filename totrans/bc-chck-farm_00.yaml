    worms that roil and roll along white ceramic tile. A child’s socks and underwear
    are hung out to dry on a small rack next to the sink. It’s been raining all day.
    I’m in a small village in southern China, at the border of Jiangxi and Guangdong.
    I arrived in the village to try to understand how e-commerce has affected life
    here, with farmers selling goods directly to consumers, using WeChat’s robust
    mobile payment system. After missing the last bus back to the nearest city, I
    am now on an involuntary meditation retreat.

    conditions, which is why I’m staying at the most modern house in the village,
    by myself. It’s a two-story concrete building with an outhouse that has a ceramic
    squat toilet, just a few convenient steps away from the front door.

    a small plastic space heater that defeatedly wheezes lukewarm air. It’s the only
    sound I hear besides a low, watery gurgle, accompanied by the wind rattling through
    cracks of the window frame.

    emphasized by the silence of the village. My movements feel muffled and dull.
    I am unused to this kind of solitude, as someone who spends most of my time in
    cities, and I am scared—stuck in a new place with only the worms to talk to, maybe
    a ghost or two, replaying supernatural horror movies in my mind. Without the stimulation
    of light and sound, my mind turns over thoughts and stories on repeat, revisiting
    inconsequentially boring past moments like a mantra: Did Xinghai think I was a
    jerk because I didn’t say thank you earlier when he dropped me off? Did I end
    my e-mail to Gu in the wrong tone? What if I get stuck in this village forever?
    How slow would I be at harvesting rice? I get bored with my own thoughts and download
    a night-light app on my phone after scrolling through pages of App Store reviews.'

    I had been traveling for days, and in my exhaustion, his question took on a more
    existential note. It took me a minute before I could sputter, “I’m here to see
    you.”

- en: I felt the pull of rural China about three years ago, after visiting villages
    in Guizhou, seeing a side of China very different from the one portrayed in most
    forms of media. This pull was amplified by my need to challenge my own *metronormativity*—a
    portmanteau of “metropolitan” and “normative,” coined by the theorist and scholar
    Jack Halberstam.

- en: Metronormativity is pervasive—it’s the normative, standard idea that somehow
    rural culture and rural people are backward, conservative, and intolerant, and
    that the only way to live with freedom is to leave the countryside for highly
    connected urban oases. Metronormativity fuels the notion that the internet, technology,
    and media literacy will somehow “save” or “educate” rural people, either by allowing
    them to experience the broader world, offering new livelihoods, or reducing misinformation.

- en: For me, challenging this metronormativity is crucial. So much of the extended
    crises and the rise of authoritarian populism throughout the world has been a
    result of globalization. The urban-rural dynamic is central to globalization,
    with rural areas serving as the engine, the site of extractive industries from
    industrial agriculture to rare earth mining. I believe our ability to confront
    metronormativity will determine our shared future. We are intertwined across cities,
    villages, and national boundaries, bound by material circumstance.

    dusty highways past wind turbines and data centers, visited villages where artificial
    intelligence training data is made, and seen empty villages where all the young
    people have left for electronics factory jobs in cities. Rather than seeing the
    way technology has shifted or produced new livelihoods in rural China, I have
    been humbled to see the ways rural China fuels the technology we use every day,
    around the world.

    of rural versus urban, natural versus man-made, digital versus physical, and remote
    as disengaged versus metropolitan as connected. To question metronormativity demands
    a vision of living that serves life itself, and not just life in cities. Embarking
    on this line of questioning demanded a big change in my own core beliefs.

    its geographic distance from the United States, it remains a kind of periphery.
    These rural peripheries, the edges of the world, hidden from view, enable our
    existence in cities. These areas produce everything from the cotton in the clothes
    we wear to the minerals that create the computers in data centers. They also produce
    the food we eat. It is impossible to disentangle the countryside from food—food
    is at the core of the dynamic between the rural and the global. As humans, we
    eat to survive, and our appetite for food has carved new geographies and technologies
    into the world. Urbanite appetites, especially, have shifted rural economies,
    ecologies, and societies over the past three decades.

    climate change, which creates economic and ecological relationships at a dizzying
    array of scales throughout the world. Yet agriculture and what we eat are tangible
    manifestations of these entangled global issues that affect all of us. According
    to a recent United Nations report, a third of human greenhouse gas emissions stem
    from industrial agricultural practices. These same industrial agriculture practices
    have rearranged the way rural communities live, fomenting political change around
    the world.

- en: Conducting research in rural China meant that I could, selfishly, return to
    villages that I love being in. There was an allure to living at a pace and scale
    that felt comprehensible, to living in a place that felt grounded. It is easy
    to romanticize rural Chinese villages as idyllic scenes of nature, small and disengaged—yet
    many of them are sites of economies and agricultural practices that are foundational
    to our world. And as numerous historians, such as Robert Brenner and Sue Headlee,
    have shown, shifts in agriculture and rural politics were crucial for the transition
    into industrialization and capitalism throughout the world. In thinking through
    agriculture, through a sense of place and belonging, I was influenced by the writings
    of bell hooks and Wendell Berry, for whom being and belonging acquire a sense
    of urgency—especially in a political and economic system that dislocates people
    from place and community. It would have been easy to attribute the loss of belonging,
    of place, to just technology accelerating us into the singularity of despondency.
    But challenging my metronormativity meant challenging these ideas of the digital
    world versus the physical world, and pulling back the idea that becoming a Luddite
    and disengaging is the only way to reclaim a sense of belonging.

    in places that produce the technology we use, places that show how globally entangled
    we are with one another, allows me to confront the scarier question that technology
    poses: What does it mean to live, to be human right now? Looking at tech in rural
    China forced me to examine the ideologies that drive engineers and companies to
    build everything from AI farming systems and blockchain food projects to shopping
    sites and payment platforms. These assumptions about humans and the way the world
    *should* work are more powerful than sheer technical curiosity in driving the
    creation of new technologies and platforms. Embedded in these tools are their
    makers’ and builders’ assumptions about what humans need, and how humans *should*
    interact. It is not enough to critique these assumptions, because in simply critiquing,
    we remain caught in the long list of binaries: Tech is dehumanizing, tech brings
    liberation. Tech dragged the world into the mess it’s in, tech frees it from this
    mess. Tech creates isolation, tech connects marginalized communities. The difficult
    work that we face is to live and thrive beyond binaries and assumptions, and to
    aid and enable others to do so. How do we begin this work?'

    Lee Boggs wrote *The Next American Revolution*. Published in 2010, the book sounded
    an alarm bell for our present condition—a time when politics was no longer politics
    as usual, where traditional forms of protest were not enough to induce change,
    and when ecological disaster wrought by unfettered material and technological
    growth was looming. Despite all this, she pointed to a source of hope: “the great
    turning.” The great turning, a term borrowed from Buddhism, refers to a growing
    tidal wave of people now taking the first step toward change: addressing spiritual
    impoverishment. “These are the times to grow our souls,” she writes. The way to
    respond to crisis is to practice compassion and change the cycle of suffering.
    We can all actively practice compassion in our own way, whether we are doctors,
    teachers, or businesspeople. Engineers and makers and builders of technology have
    this opportunity; I hope this book sparks something for you. After all, code is
    words made executable—we must take care in what we say. And for those of us who
    see code as an apocryphal text, who see technology as indeed accelerating us toward
    a despondent, tightly controlled world, I hope this book reaffirms the power that
    you hold in *being human*, and demonstrates ways certain technologies might actually
    serve open systems. To spark the great turning, we need to transform our compassion,
    our imagination, and our society—we cannot focus on reforming our technologies
    alone. Most of all, I hope that this book brings you to parts of China that you
    might never visit, takes you beyond a map of abstractions, a flat map made by
    metronormativity.'
