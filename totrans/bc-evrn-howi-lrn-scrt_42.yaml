    amphitheater in Boston. The website showed gourmet food, hundreds of attendees,
    top business leaders from all over the world. How could I say no? This was the
    Global Blockchain Summit!

    conference room of maybe a dozen people. In one corner a half-eaten pizza drooped
    sadly over the edge of its cardboard box, soggy salad strewn about the table.

  prefs: []

    up in cardboard containers. But an animal makes them. It sits down on a nest and
    produces them out of some kind of egg hole. Nature—always something new!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s pretty great to get fresh eggs, especially when you’re friendly with the
    chickens that produced them. When you crack open a fresh egg, the yolk is electric
    yellow. Unlike the pale, watery yolks of store-bought eggs, those of fresh eggs
    are packed with an explosion of nutrients and goodness.

    anything but free. They live in this postmodern coop that was designed by a team
    from London’s Royal College of Art. They feast on high-end trail mix. They get
    electric heat in the winter. On a cost-per-egg basis, it’s about a dollar each.

    and give them a pep talk. “Come on, chicks!” I’ll shout. (That’s not sexist; that’s
    reminding them where they came from.) “Let’s get laying, ladies!”

    you can get them to produce more eggs during the winter by installing indoor lighting
    in your chicken coop. And I’m like, “Great. Now they want a tanning salon.”

    the garage, then eventually to the upstairs fridge when we’re ready to eat them.
  prefs: []

    eggs. It’s like they’re filled with gold. So you can imagine my dismay when the
    container caught on the door of the garage fridge and I dropped the eggs. Yolks
    of sadness, a fluorescent yellow disaster, my own Chickenobyl.

    The chickens sometimes get in the garage, where they leave us gifts, so that was
    mixed in, too. It was a fully loaded floor omelet. A flomelet.

    if you drop the basket, you lose all the eggs. That’s true. But it’s also true
    that you have to have some baskets. Otherwise you’re shuttling eggs one at a time
    between the coop and the upstairs refrigerator.
