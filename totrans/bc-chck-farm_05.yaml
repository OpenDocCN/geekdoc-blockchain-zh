    run an import-export business that sold millions of small birds like these. My
    uncle would frequently fly from the Pearl River Delta to the United States for
    trade shows, bringing sample boxes of fake birds, fake flowers, small baskets,
    little Styrofoam mushrooms and gnomes. He’d stay with my family for a few days,
    enjoying my mother’s cooking instead of the American fast food available on the
    road. Sometimes he would leave extra boxes of these trade show samples with us,
    no longer useful once deals were made. Stuck to them were always the words *Made

    I was made fun of every day for the “weird food” I’d bring for lunch. Chinese
    restaurants were still serving General Tso’s chicken and chop suey, without the
    elevation of San Francisco’s Mister Jiu’s. People who stopped at our stand didn’t
    even know what jade was, and often asked me if it was glass. Even if our stall
    sold the highest-quality jade and we demanded more money for it, customers would
    be unable to judge the quality themselves, and would become convinced that we
    were trying to swindle them. A lot of people already thought we were trying to
    swindle them, by virtue of being Chinese. So of course we sold the lowest-quality
    jade, hoping at least someone, maybe entranced by the green-blue swirl of color,
    would find the low price a little easier to entertain and make a harmless impulse
    purchase.

    Its original form in Latin means “to *renew*, to introduce something *as new*,”
    perhaps subliminally acknowledging that the category “entirely new” is difficult
    to define. The word “innovation” was derogatory in the age of monarchs, as it
    referred to political and economic change that could bring down empires, threatening
    the status of kings and elites. But slowly, throughout the Industrial Revolution,
    the phrase began to be seen as more positive when engineering culture took shape.
    In the early 1900s, Thorstien Veblen advocated the idea that technology was the
    output, the *product* of a group of male workers he termed “engineers.”^([1](notes-ch5.xhtml#notes-ch5-1))

    rural China, failure means the difference between a life of difficult manual labor,
    and a vague shot at being able to escape poverty. As China’s P2P (peer-to-peer)
    lending scandals unfold, they show that investing and failure are markedly different
    when it’s a VC firm taking the risk versus a seventy-year-old retiree. And for

    of Guangdong rice had unexpectedly high cadmium levels, due to fertilizer overuse.
    Yangguang village’s soil was fortunately unaffected. Still, a few years ago Farmer
    Qiu sensed that something else was wrong with the soil—it had become hardened
    and compact, vastly different from the soil he knew from childhood.

- en: Rice farming is a labor-intensive art. Some regions in China rely on methods
    that are ancient. The rice-fish-duck system, for example, is a dynamic living
    system that requires no chemical fertilizers or pesticides. The system uses fish
    that live in the flooded paddies eating insects as a natural insect repellent.
    Ducks also live in the paddies, providing fertilizer and an added repellent, against
    snails. During harvest season, the paddies are drained and the fish are easily
    caught and preserved in wine. The ducks live on for the next season. Paddies are
    also often small, given the geography of the mountainous rice-growing regions
    in southern China. Mechanization is difficult.

    is tied to everyone else’s. In Yangguang rice terraces, water moves through ancient
    paddies from the top of the mountain slowly down to the lowest terraces, in a
    form of natural irrigation. Every five years, farmers switch paddies through a
    lottery system, ensuring that no family is stuck with a paddy in a lower or higher
    region forever. No one has contiguous paddies from this random lottery system,
    making irrigation a space of constant negotiation. If your paddy is at the top
    of the mountain and you use up all the water by building a dam, you risk blocking
    water to your own paddy somewhere else, and also other families’. If you use pesticides
    in your paddy, residue will flow down into other paddies.

    sides of paddies can affect the testing of a neighbor’s site. Village meetings
    happen on account of this pesticide-free, organic rice-farming system. Xinghai
    shows me pictures from a recent meeting where farmers sat together, debating what
    to do about all the weeds, taking votes, estimating their yield and harvest for
    the season. As a cooperative, they all have a fiscal stake in the venture.

- en: Membership in the Rice Harmony Cooperative has been growing every year, and
    this is no small feat in modern China, where individualism is increasing and the
    memory of previously disastrous attempts at collectivization by the government
    remains. Yet the cooperative structure centers the community as the locus of decision-making,
    creating a collective investment that is resilient under the strain of strong
    personalities and politics. This is not an easy process to navigate, with cooperative
    members needing to resolve conflict rather than walk away from it. As a *shanzhai*
    endeavor, actions cannot be singular and individual. Xinghai and Qiu spend planting
    seasons in their own fields, and alongside other farmers, providing technical
    advice and negotiating interpersonal conflict.

    motion are shared among cooperative members. These machines have been built by
    Qiu and Xinghai, who worked with local blacksmiths to dice up existing machines,
    creating new blades and attachments. In front of the Rice Harmony lending library
    are two of these Frankenstein machines.

    and platforms to sell its rice, people, not technology, stand firmly at the helm
    of decision-making. It’s also an open process—during harvest seasons, Rice Harmony
    encourages visitors from all over the world to come to learn about organic farming.
    This type of farming, like any system, is not without its critics, who argue that
    it can’t scale up, it can’t create enough yield, that it’s not scientific like
    more engineered, industrial practices. Unsurprisingly, it is the local government
    that pushes scientific, rational forms of management, including the use of pesticides
    and fertilizers. Yet for all the debate on process, in Yangguang village, this
    farming is working.

    to renew, to change political and social structures. Innovation is literally an
    ecosystem for Rice Harmony—an ecosystem that does not scale across thousands or
    millions of users but across the spectrum of time instead, regenerating the soil
    and community ties from one planting season to the next. For that, you don’t need
    VC funding, a legion of engineers, or millions of users.

    of rice straw used as organic fertilizer. If innovation casts the spell of capitalism,
    in this mountain stronghold, I see *shanzhai* as a verb, used to cast a different
    kind of spell. To *shanzhai*. To turn protocols into practices that bind us together
    rather than centralize authority. To turn back the worship of scale and renew
    our commitments to care. I think back to the words I heard when I was a kid, the
    other magical phrase, *Made in China*, and the dismissive tone in the man’s voice.
    Barometers of success and innovation are invented by those with money, turning
    engagement into the surface-level interactions of informed users, rather than
    the deeper actions that tackle structural, social change by invested citizens
    willing to hold long village meetings. Entire entrepreneurship programs exist,
    funded by VCs, designed to foster what VCs see as the core values of innovation.
    Instead of continuing to accept success and innovation as empty containers, I
    propose new measures, understanding our world through *shanzhai*, through the
    ability to care, maintain, renew, and deepen commitments.

    help control pests. She whistles on her way up a mountain. A whole socioeconomic
    ecosystem stems from the technical farming infrastructure in this village. It
    makes me wonder what the parallel might be for our network infrastructure. And
    as scary as it might sound, to *shanzhai* the world will take time, as we confront
    our definitions of rationality, as we question intellectual property and what
    it means to exist meaningfully without boundaries of individual ownership. To
    *shanzhai* means we give up parts of our ego, rather than innovating a quick fix
    that scales to millions. After all, money and seed funds are finite, but time
    is long and ever passing, leaving us with more questions than answers.
