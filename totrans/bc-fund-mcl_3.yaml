    must decide whether to lead blockchain development; participate in the development
    with ecosystem partners; or wait until others develop the platforms and applications
    and join later. As the first quote above from Vitalik Buterin attests, blockchains
    promise to radically disrupt some business models. Therefore, blockchain’s threat
    of taking third-parties out of the equation opens up a whole new world of automation
    and efficiency that should (rightly) have most C-suite executives doing their
    homework. The second quote from Warren Buffet expresses a rather impotent view
    of Bitcoin, and seems to suggest it’s not worth an executive’s time (at least
    not yet). In our research, blockchain’s dissenters made similar statements, such
    as *“there are no legitimate use cases”*, and *“blockchains are over-hyped”*.
    The third quote seems to suggest blockchains are best left to the younger generation.
    Which opinions are most compelling? Wading through the arguments and evidence,
    we grant that, as we enter 2020, blockchains for business are indeed following
    a traditional technology hype cycle. However, the point is that most technologies
    eventually do mature; managers eventually learn to adapt them for purposeful use;
    and ultimately, innovations like blockchains become institutionalized as part
    of our technical architecture. This is already happening for the early-adopters
    discussed throughout this guide. Bottom line: we believe executives need to give
    blockchain technologies even more attention than they are giving to other technological
    innovations, like analytics or artificial intelligence. Why? Whereas most innovation
    decisions happen within the boundaries of the firm, blockchains are shared applications
    that require shared decision making with ecosystem partners. It requires an unprecedented
    level of cooperation with competitors and other mindshifts that only an executive
    can champion efficaciously.'

    most in-demand technical skill*** for 2020 in the United States; United Kingdom;
    France; Germany; and Australia. Information technology professionals will need
    to learn how to develop, test and integrate decentralized applications (dApps).
    Additionally, blockchain technologies likely will represent only 20 to 30 percent
    of an end-to-end-system, so IT students and IT professionals must learn how to
    integrate dApps with traditional applications. Specifically, dApps will be integrated
    with data collection devices like Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Radio Frequency
    Identification (RFID); with existing systems of records like Enterprise Resource
    Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software; and with web-based
    and mobile user interfaces. Chapters [3](chapter03.xhtml) and [8](chapter08.xhtml)
    will be of particular interest to IT professionals and students.

    triple-entry booking in which every transaction has three entries: the credit,
    the debit, and the public receipt stored on a shared ledger (see [Figure 0.1](#f_0_1)).
    With blockchain technologies, every transaction in the ledger is already verified,
    balances are guaranteed to be correct and current, and everything is transparent.
    Accountants will need to understand the implications on bookkeeping, reconciliations,
    audits, and accounts payable and receivable. Mike Walker, Senior Director of Applied
    Innovation and Digital Transformation for Microsoft said, *“Reconciliations are
    on the endangered species list”*. However, this does not mean that the demand
    for accounting skills will decrease. Blockchain technologies could actually create
    more value-added work for accountants by freeing them up to tackle tasks that
    require judgement and advice. According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants
    in England and Wales (ICAEW):'

    other value-adding activities will expand. To properly audit a company with significant
    blockchain-based transactions, the focus of the auditor will shift. There is little
    need to confirm the accuracy or existence of blockchain transactions with external
    sources, but there is still plenty of attention to pay to how those transactions
    are recorded and recognized in the financial statements, and how judgmental elements
    such as valuations are decided.”*'

    When the ‘Internet of Value’ becomes ubiquitous, individuals will be in charge
    of their data; they will decide its worth and with whom they will share it. Instead
    of paying Google or Facebook to post advertisements, marketers likely will pay
    consumers directly to watch an advertisement. Marketers will have to employ new
    methods to find consumers and to gain their attention and trust. Social media
    platforms, like the blockchain-based Steemit, already allow the community to decide

    technologies promise patient empowerment. From a patients’ perspective, our confidential
    healthcare data—like immunizations; blood tests; diagnoses; allergies; prescription
    medicines; treatments; surgical procedures; behaviors (like smoking or exercising)—are
    in the possession of doctors, governments, health care providers, employers, and
    insurance providers. Increasingly, people are concerned about what TTPs and governments
    might do with their healthcare data. For example, millions of people have given
    their DNA to ‘find their ancestors’, but what if the data was sold to insurance
    companies? Might they use genetic weaknesses to determine coverage and insurance
    rates or to decline coverage altogether? Alternatively, if everyone’s healthcare
    data were stored on a blockchain, individuals could decide with whom to share
    their information. This model may be a way off, but there are many startups working
    on doing just that. MedRec, a startup from the MIT Media Lab, provides a patient-centered
    electronic health record sharing platform. According to an article in the *Harvard
    Business Review*, *“it doesn’t store health records or require a change in practice.
    It stores a signature of the record on a blockchain and notifies the patient,
    who is ultimately in control of where that record can travel.”*
