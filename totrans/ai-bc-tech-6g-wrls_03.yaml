  zh: 摘要
- en: The Internet has evolved from a fault-tolerant infrastructure to support both
    social networking and a semantic web for machine users. Trust in the data, and
    the infrastructure, has become increasingly important as cyber threats and privacy
    concerns rise. Communication services become increasingly delivered through virtualized,
    software-defined infrastructures, like overlays across multiple infrastructure
    providers. Increasing recognition of the need for services to be not only fault-tolerant
    but also censorship-resistant while delivering an increasing variety of services
    through a complex ecosystem of service providers drives the need for decentralized
    solutions like blockchains. Service providers have traditionally relied on contractual
    arrangements to deliver end-to-end services globally. Some of the contract terms
    can now be automated through smart contracts on blockchains. This is a complex
    distributed environment with multiple actors and resources. Blockchains are not
    only proposed for use at a business services level but also in the operation of
    the network infrastructure including dynamic spectrum management, SDN and resource
    management, metering and IoT services. Traditional approaches to network management
    have relied on client–server protocols and centralized architectures. Digital
    transformation at both network operators and many of their customers has led to
    a software-defined infrastructure for communication services, based on virtualized
    network functions. Decentralized approaches for network management have gained
    increasing attention from researchers. The operators increased need for mechanisms
    to assure trust in data, operations and commercial transactions while maintaining
    business continuity through software and equipment failures, and cyberattacks
    provide further motivations for blockchain-based approaches.

  zh: 1 引言
- en: The Internet has evolved from a fault-tolerant infrastructure to support both
    social networking and a semantic web for machine users. 6G radio technologies
    bring network performance improvements (e.g., in bandwidth and latency) that promise
    not only performance improvements for existing applications but also the possibility
    of enabling new types of applications at scale. Haptic technologies are perhaps
    the most easily recognizable new category of applications because they bring a
    new sensory mechanism (touch) to communications. Touch is a human sensory mechanism,
    but machine users of the Internet have different communication needs. The scale
    of deployments and breadth of applications for machine uses of network technologies
    are larger than human communication deployments, and billions of devices are already
    deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT). Human communication through networks
    has evolved through telegraph, voice, video and now haptic services requiring
    significantly more data. The data generated and analysed through distributed IoT
    devices is also expected to grow significantly [[1](#CR1)]. Progress in analytics,
    and semantic annotation of available data, also supports increased machine uses
    of communication services. The law of large numbers dictates that failures are
    inevitable in systems of this scale. Sophisticated architectures and redundant
    deployments have largely constrained the scope of physical failures. As communications
    have become more data-centric, and used by machines rather than humans, issues
    related to data failures (e.g., incomplete, improperly formatted, unverifiable
    and untrustworthy data) become more problematic.

  zh: 互联网已经从容错的基础设施发展到支持社交网络和语义网以供机器用户使用。 6G无线电技术带来了网络性能的提高（例如，带宽和延迟），这不仅承诺了现有应用程序的性能提升，而且可能还可能在规模上支持新类型的应用程序。触觉技术可能是最容易识别的新类别的应用程序，因为它们为通信引入了一种新的感觉机制（触摸）。触摸是一种人类感官机制，但互联网的机器用户具有不同的通信需求。网络技术的机器使用的部署规模和应用广度大于人类通信部署，并且已经有数十亿台设备部署在物联网中。通过分布式物联网设备生成和分析的数据也预计会显著增长[[1](#CR1)]。在可用数据的分析和语义注释方面的进展也支持了通信服务的机器使用的增加。大数法则规定，在这种规模的系统中，故障是不可避免的。复杂的架构和冗余的部署大部分限制了物理故障的范围。随着通信变得更加以数据为中心，并由机器而不是人类使用，与数据故障相关的问题（例如，不完整，格式不正确，无法验证和不可信的数据）变得更加棘手。
- en: Trust in the data, and the infrastructure, has become increasingly important
    as cyber threats and privacy concerns rise. Trust and reputation have historically
    been human evaluations, but these concepts are increasingly applied in computational
    and communication contexts. Trust in wireless networks has been studied for more
    than 10 years [[2](#CR2)]. Trust is an increasingly important characteristic of
    IoT applications [[3](#CR3)]. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have become
    increasingly important in evaluating trust computationally [[4](#CR4)]. Blockchains
    have also gained broad attention as a trust machine design pattern. Trust is critical
    in the uncertain and evolving relationships between entities. As applications,
    including network management, evolve from centralized monolithic architectures
    towards decentralized microservice architectures, the number of communicating
    entities necessarily increases and so does the importance of trust in those communications.
    Network management is not just the trustworthiness of the data it consumes, but
    also the management of trust relationships required for the proper operation of
    the infrastructure.

  zh: 信任数据和基础设施已经变得越来越重要，因为网络威胁和隐私问题不断上升。信任和声誉历来是人类评估的概念，但这些概念越来越多地应用于计算和通信环境。无线网络的信任已经研究了超过10年[[2](#CR2)]。信任是物联网应用程序的一个日益重要的特征[[3](#CR3)]。人工智能（AI）方法在计算评估信任方面变得越来越重要[[4](#CR4)]。区块链也作为一种信任机制设计模式引起了广泛关注。在不确定和不断演变的实体关系中，信任是至关重要的。随着应用程序，包括网络管理，从集中式的单片架构向分布式微服务架构演变，通信实体的数量必然增加，因此在这些通信中信任的重要性也增加了。网络管理不仅是对其消耗的数据的可信度，还包括对基础设施正常运行所需的信任关系的管理。
- en: Communication services become increasingly delivered through virtualized, software-defined
    infrastructures, like overlays across multiple infrastructure providers. Virtualized
    infrastructures are based on some model or abstraction of the underlying resources.
    That model may have limited accuracy, precision or range of operating validity.
    The underlying resources are multidimensional (e.g., computing, storage and bandwidth),
    distributed and heterogeneous in nature. While there have been significant theoretical
    efforts associated with optimizing these resources, experimental approaches to
    characterizing the resources can also be expedient [[5](#CR5)]. Software-defined
    infrastructures enable automated configuration of those infrastructures, but the
    optimal degree of configurability and level of resource granularity remain open
    issues [[6](#CR6)]. This has not, however, precluded applications of large-scale
    virtualized infrastructures in 5G [[7](#CR7)]. Traditional networks have always
    required multiple operators to provide a global infrastructure. 5G networks. The
    higher bandwidths of 5G (and 6G) come through higher frequency carriers at a trade-off
    of a more limited range, resulting in a bias towards deployments of small cells
    as infrastructure. A variety of different business models have been proposed to
    support large-scale deployments of small cells [[8](#CR8)]. The net result seems
    likely to be an increased number of infrastructure providers that need to be dynamically
    assembled in order to provide global services. This adds to the complexity of
    the tasks in the management of such external, decentralized resources.

  zh: 通信服务越来越通过虚拟化、软件定义的基础设施进行交付，例如跨多个基础设施提供商的覆盖层。虚拟化基础设施基于对底层资源的某种模型或抽象。该模型可能具有有限的准确性、精度或操作有效性范围。底层资源是多维的（例如，计算、存储和带宽），分布式且异构的。虽然已经有了大量与优化这些资源相关的理论努力，但通过实验方法对资源进行表征也可能是有效的
    [[5](#CR5)]。软件定义的基础设施使这些基础设施的自动配置成为可能，但配置可调性的最佳程度和资源粒度的级别仍然是开放问题 [[6](#CR6)]。然而，这并没有阻止大规模虚拟化基础设施在5G
    [[7](#CR7)]中的应用。传统网络一直需要多个运营商来提供全球基础设施。5G网络。5G（和6G）的更高带宽是通过更高频率的载波来实现的，但代价是更有限的范围，导致更偏向于部署小区作为基础设施。已提出了各种不同的商业模式来支持小区的大规模部署
    [[8](#CR8)]。最终结果似乎很可能是需要动态组装更多的基础设施提供商，以提供全球服务。这增加了管理此类外部、分散资源的任务的复杂性。
- en: Increasing recognition of the need for services to be not only fault-tolerant
    but also censorship-resistant, while delivering an increasing variety of services
    through a complex ecosystem of service providers, drives the need for decentralized
    solutions like blockchains. Communication infrastructures have been designed and
    developed to be resilient in the face of a wide variety of physical and environmental
    disasters (e.g., hurricanes, tornados). As the global economy has become more
    data-driven, it has become more sensitive not just to infrastructure availability
    but also to the validity of the information being passed. Censorship of communications
    for political, commercial or personal reasons can be viewed as an attack on the
    integrity of the information infrastructure, but the scope and scale of such attacks
    is a subject of ongoing study [[9](#CR9)]. These types of attacks seem likely
    to increase rather than fade away, and hence infrastructure architectural approaches
    that provide resilience in the face of censorship attacks seem likely to be needed
    in the 6G context. Blockchain infrastructures have been proposed as a mechanism
    to provide some degree of censorship resistance. Whether through deletion or distortion
    of data, censorship is a fundamental threat to communication integrity. Detecting,
    measuring and controlling such threats is a significant challenge for communication
    networks to manage.

  zh: 人们越来越认识到服务不仅需要容错性，还需要抗审查性，同时通过服务提供商复杂的生态系统提供越来越多样化的服务，这推动了像区块链这样的去中心化解决方案的需求。通信基础设施的设计和开发是为了在面对各种各样的物理和环境灾害时具有弹性（例如，飓风，龙卷风）。随着全球经济变得更加数据驱动，对基础设施可用性以及传递信息的有效性的敏感性也越来越高。由于政治、商业或个人原因对通信进行审查可以被视为对信息基础设施完整性的攻击，但这些攻击的范围和规模是一个正在进行研究的课题[[9](#CR9)]。这类攻击似乎有可能增加而不是减少，因此，在6G环境中提供抗审查攻击弹性的基础架构方法似乎是需要的。区块链基础设施被提议作为提供某种程度的抗审查性的机制。无论是通过删除还是扭曲数据，审查都是对通信完整性的基本威胁。检测、测量和控制这类威胁对于通信网络来说是一个重大挑战。
- en: Service providers have traditionally relied on contractual arrangements to deliver
    end-to-end services globally. With 6G, the variety of services and the number
    of service providers are both expected to increase. This leads to pressure for
    automated mechanisms for service providers to dynamically assemble the required
    service partners to deliver services to their customers. With the rise of IoT
    and other machine users, APIs and other automation become necessary to enable
    service delivery. Blockchains have been proposed as a mechanism for financial
    settlements between remote parties. Some of the contract terms (e.g., liquidated
    damages in the event of service failures) can now be automated through smart contracts
    on blockchains. Automation in the contracting for service invocation and modification
    (e.g., via APIs) may be a novelty for communication services today. As the proportion
    of machine users increases in 6G, however, it becomes more of a necessity. This
    automation of contracting activities increases the scope of network management
    responsibilities.

    is a complex task. Virtualization of infrastructure enables data-driven automation.
    Without trustworthy data to drive that software automation, the management operations
    of the service provider can be subverted. Automation can also exacerbate the scope
    and scale of failures. Carefully targeted automation can help overcome fragility
    in the infrastructure. The inevitability of failures in large-scale systems emphasizes
    the importance of automated mechanisms for failover and service restoral. Decentralization
    eliminates the single point of failure in centralized systems. With 5G deployments

- en: Framing this discussion on blockchain-enabled decentralized network management
    in 6G requires an understanding of the 6G context. The following section provides
    an overview of 6G with an emphasis on the scope of the resource and service management
    required. Section [3](#Sec3) reviews the evolution of decentralized network management
    technologies and architectures. Blockchain technology was initially developed
    to support fintech applications, particularly transactions between remote parties.
    While network management has always had an implied concern with operational costs,
    the use of blockchain infrastructure in communication markets is a disruptive
    approach to what have been heavily regulated markets. Economic models for network
    management in 6G are considered in Sect. [4](#Sec4). Smart contracts have been
    used to automate financial transactions. Section [5](#Sec5) considers the role
    of smart contracts and APIs in decentralized network management. Smart contracts
    are but one form of automation. The volume, variety, velocity, value and veracity
    of the data driving network management in large communication infrastructures
    is a clearly a big data problem requiring automated support. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) is often proposed as a mechanism to support automation in the context of
    big data problems. The role of AI in decentralized network management is reviewed
    in Sect. [6](#Sec6). While blockchain approaches may be promising, that does not
    mean they are without challenges in their design, implementation and operation.
    Section [7](#Sec7) looks at the challenges for network operators in decentralizing
    network management with blockchains. Conclusions are then presented in Sect. [8](#Sec8).

- en: As the complexity of the infrastructure and business environment has grown,
    network management has been evolving from managing devices to more abstract models—managing
    resources and services. The initial data models and information models were very
    focused on device capabilities, but virtualization of the infrastructure through
    NFV/SDN brought increased abstraction from the underlying hardware, and software
    implementations executing on generic computing infrastructure. Industry forums
    have specified and standardized new network management architectures based on
    Software Defined Network, Network Function Virtualization, and orchestration or
    automation of many networks provisioning functions [[10](#CR10)]. The scope of
    network management includes not only the physical layer (radio, fibre, etc.) infrastructure
    but also the virtualized network functions and the computing infrastructure they
    execute in. The range of infrastructure functions being automated or orchestrated
    is expected to increase in the context of 6G. These new paradigms have had a great
    impact on the legacy Network Management Systems and the Operations Support System
    (OSS). The increased complexity of the business environment required more automation
    of business support services associated with operating the commercial infrastructure
    (e.g., quoting, ordering and billing). Industry responded with architectural frameworks
    such as TMFs Open Digital Architecture (ODA) [[11](#CR11)] and the more service-specific
    Lifecycle Service Orchestration (LSO) from the MEF [[12](#CR12)]. Frameworks like
    these help enable end-to-end automation across multiple service providers—including
    those delivering services through 5G and 6G wireless interfaces. The new spectrum
    deployed for 5G and 6G is at higher frequencies, with a correspondingly shorter
    range, favouring small cells. The specialized services in 5G and the small cell
    focus reinforce private network deployment models rather than basic wide-area
    public services. The need to deliver end-to-end services through a variety of
    private networks reinforces the need for these architectural frameworks in the
    6G context. The scope of services to be managed in the infrastructure includes
    not only the traditional connectivity services but also these additional automated
    business support functions.

    对基础设施进行虚拟化，使得基础设施从底层硬件中更抽象出来，并在通用计算基础设施上执行软件实现。行业论坛已经制定和标准化了基于软件定义网络、网络功能虚拟化以及许多网络配置功能的编排或自动化的新网络管理架构[[10](#CR10)]。网络管理的范围不仅包括物理层（无线、光纤等）基础设施，还包括虚拟化的网络功能及其所在的计算基础设施。预计在
    6G 的背景下，自动化或编排的基础设施功能范围将增加。这些新的范式对传统的网络管理系统和运营支持系统（OSS）产生了巨大影响。商业环境的复杂性增加需要更多自动化的商业支持服务，包括操作商业基础设施的报价、订购和计费。行业响应的架构框架包括
    TMF 的开放数字架构（ODA）[[11](#CR11)]和更加服务特定的 MEF 的生命周期服务编排（LSO）[[12](#CR12)]。像这样的框架有助于实现跨多个服务提供商的端到端自动化——包括通过
    5G 和 6G 无线接口提供服务的服务提供商。5G 和 6G 部署的新频谱位于更高频率，对应的传输范围更短，更青睐于小区。5G 中的专用服务和小区重点加强了私有网络部署模式，而不是基本的广域公共服务。需要通过各种私有网络交付端到端服务的需求加强了在
    6G 背景下这些架构框架的需求。基础设施中要管理的服务范围不仅包括传统的连接服务，还包括这些额外的自动化商业支持功能。
- en: The trend from universal service-to-service fragmentation is expected to continue
    in 6G. Virtualization of the infrastructure with NFV-SDN makes prevalent the concepts
    of network overlays, network underlays and network slices. Blockchain implementations
    of SDN controllers have been proposed for increased security [[13](#CR13)]. The
    option of virtualized infrastructure also enables virtual operators that rely
    on under infrastructure service providers. Current NFV-SDN implementations enable
    network slicing, but are not adapted to support business agreements among mobile
    network operators (MNOs). The variety of services provided in the current 4G network
    already includes content services (e.g., video) and security services (e.g., Identity
    Management). The increasing deployment of IoT devices and edge computing can be
    expected to increase the requirement for service providers to offer a variety
    of non-traditional, trusted services. The new services in 5G and 6G (e.g., URLLC)
    use network slices to target industry verticals such as automobiles or smart cities.
    Network slices can be independently administered, adding complexity to the network
    management scope [[14](#CR14)]. As these service-specific network slices reach
    deployment and maturity, these new forms of service diversity add further variety
    to the business models that may need to be supported by the service provider.
    Increasingly diverse, and dynamic, business models are expected, with many service
    providers relying on other service providers to deliver end-to-end services. In
    this 6G context, service management, not just resource management, becomes increasingly
    required for end-to-end services to be provisioned, assured and appropriate revenue
    collected by the parties involved. Blockchain approaches have been proposed for
    a variety of billing and settlement use cases [[15](#CR15)]. Industry standards
    to support such blockchain use cases are also starting to emerge [[16](#CR16)]
    as are open-source implementations [[17](#CR17)]. Service fragmentation in 6G
    creates a more complex commercial environment requiring a corresponding increase
    in the scope of network management required to deliver those services.

    SDN 控制器的区块链实现，以提高安全性[[13](#CR13)]。虚拟化基础设施的选择还使依赖于底层基础设施提供者的虚拟运营商成为可能。当前的 NFV-SDN
    实现支持网络切片，但并未适应支持移动网络运营商（MNOs）之间的商业协议。目前 4G 网络提供的服务种类已经包括内容服务（例如视频）和安全服务（例如身份管理）。预计
    IoT 设备和边缘计算的增加将增加服务提供商提供各种非传统受信任服务的要求。在 5G 和 6G 中的新服务（例如 URLLC）利用网络切片来针对汽车或智能城市等行业垂直领域。网络切片可以独立管理，这增加了网络管理范围的复杂性[[14](#CR14)]。随着这些特定于服务的网络切片的部署和成熟，这些新形式的服务多样性进一步增加了可能需要由服务提供商支持的业务模式的多样性。预计业务模式将越来越多样化，并且动态变化，许多服务提供商依赖于其他服务提供商来提供端到端服务。在这种
    6G 环境中，服务管理不仅仅是资源管理，对于端到端服务的供应、保证和适当的收入收取变得越来越需要。已经提出了一系列区块链方法来支持各种计费和结算用例[[15](#CR15)]。支持这些区块链用例的行业标准也开始出现[[16](#CR16)]，并且开源实现也在涌现[[17](#CR17)]。6G
    中的服务碎片化创建了一个更加复杂的商业环境，需要相应增加网络管理的范围来提供这些服务。
- en: Network management’s scope has traditionally included categories such as Fault,
    Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security (FCAPS). Service assurance
    in this context has traditionally devolved to availability, but that may no longer
    be adequate for 6G. Governments, enterprises and individuals are becoming increasingly
    dependent on data-driven information systems. Information access design patterns
    are also trending to embrace zero-trust network architectures [[18](#CR18)]. Such
    approaches required finer grained controls over data access. Such controls also
    need to be managed efficiently at scale. With cybersecurity threats on the rise,
    the risk of data tampering, poisoning or censorship gains increasing attention
    as well as privacy risks associated with unauthorized or unwelcome data exposures.
    These can be viewed as failures of the information infrastructure. In the 6G era,
    it seems that service providers will need to provide network management service
    assurance beyond availability including aspects such as identities, trustworthiness
    and censorship resistance. The scope of 6G network management needs to expand
    to include the trustworthiness and censorship resistance of the data underlying
    the delivered services and the various identities engaged in service delivery.
    The scope of 6G network management responsibility in configuration and accounting
    may remain like current practices; albeit with new resources and services to be
    configured and accounted for. The scope of network management responsibilities
    in fault, performance and security would seem to be increased with attention to
    new dimensions for data resources and services. 6G network management will require
    new metrics, measurement and control techniques to provide service assurances
    in data dimensions such as privacy, trustworthiness and censorship resistance.

    licensing has allocated frequency bands within specified geographic areas to specific

    areas provide a basis for decentralized solutions. Unlicensed spectrum may be
    used by multiple parties—typically accepting the risk of interference. Even licensed
    spectrum may not always be used—offering the potential for innovation. To leverage
    such spectrum whitespace typically requires regulatory or licensing changes, and
    also, coordination mechanisms to reduce interference. The deployment of small
    cells, particularly in private networks, provides a specific context for spectrum
    sharing that seems likely to be prevalent in 6G. Blockchain mechanisms have been

- en: Industry vertical services (Retail, Manufacturing 4.0, Healthcare 4.0) provide
    customized network configurations optimized for specific industries. These often
    include additional design and assurance aspects to be compliant with industry-specific
    guidelines. With the advent of 5G verticals and the Internet of Things paradigm,
    Edge Computing has emerged as the most dominant service delivery architecture,
    placing augmented computing resources in the proximity of end users. The resource
    orchestration of edge clouds relies on the concept of network slicing, which provides
    logically isolated computing and network resources. The orchestration of multi-domain
    infrastructure or multi-administrative domain is still an open challenge. Reference
    [[25](#CR25)] proposes a blockchain-based service orchestrator that leverages
    the automation capabilities of smart contracts to establish cross-service communication
    between network slices of different tenants. They also introduce a multi-tier
    architecture of a Blockchain-based network marketplace, and design the life cycle
    of the cross-service orchestration. By customizing services to industry verticals,
    service providers deliver greater value at the cost of having to manage a greater
    number of more complex services. Since these industry vertical services are not
    collocated, the infrastructure necessarily becomes more fragmented and decentralized.
    Industry vertical services imply increased scale, complexity and decentralization
    of the network management tasks the service provider needs to deliver these services.
    Figure [1](#Fig1) illustrates the increasing complexity of service provider relationships.
    In Fig. [1](#Fig1)a, the client relationship with the service provider is the
    major focus, but this assumes that a single service provider can meet the client’s
    needs. For more global services (e.g., Internet), collaboration across multiple
    service providers is needed and this has traditionally been achieved through manual
    curation of a set of commercial relationships by the service provider, who then
    masks these relationships from the consumer as shown in Fig. [1](#Fig1)b. As the
    variety of services becomes both more fragmented (with more types of service providers)
    and more dynamic (e.g., transactional rather than subscription), the commercial
    trust relationships become more complex and dynamic. Emerging crowdsourced infrastructure
    (e.g., Helium network, [https://​www.​helium.​com](https://www.helium.com)) provides

    view of the network resources and services being managed. In 2009, Brunner et

    which empirically analyses network management practice with respect to policy

    interviews of network administrators to identify dimensions for network policy
    including User, Device, Locus, Traffic features, Physical location, Temporality,
    Authentication and Trigger Action. Much of the recent policy- based network management
    work has been targeting intent with domain-specific, declarative languages to
    capture the policies. This trend was intensified by digital transformation and
    virtualization efforts at both network operators and many of their customers,
    starting around 2012\. This digital transformation has led to a software-defined
    infrastructure for communication services, based on virtualized network functions.
    Valocchi et al. [[31](#CR31)] proposed recognizing the increased complexity of
    centralized network management in the context of virtualized network functions
    and software-defined network infrastructures. They proposed a signalling framework
    to support decentralized management and control of virtualized communication infrastructure.
    While this approach partitioned the workload amongst local controllers, it lacks

- en: The explosive growth in wireless applications has provided an impetus for new
    network architectures beyond fixed wireless. New network architectures such as
    peer-to-peer networking, mobile ad hoc networking, delay-tolerant networking and
    pervasive computing networks. Many of these network architectures are distributed
    and self-organized leading some to refer to them as autonomous networks [[32](#CR32)].
    Autonomy in networks is often conflated with the use of artificial intelligence,
    particularly run-time learning behaviours [[33](#CR33)]. While significant strides
    in artificial intelligence have been made in recent years, cognitive autonomous
    networks have several areas requiring further research [[34](#CR34)]. Measuring
    the various dimensions of autonomy is not a simple task as these dimensions are
    often derived from social or psychological studies of human behaviour rather than
    the physics underlying most network engineering. Some blockchain structures, Decentralized
    Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), are designed to operate autonomously [[35](#CR35)].
    Autonomous networks are emerging from a research topic to industrialization among
    commercial service providers [[36](#CR36)]. The complexity in operating and managing
    5G and beyond networks has reinforced a trend towards closed-loop automation of
    network and service management operations. ETSI Zero-touch network and Service
    Management (ZSM) framework is envisaged as a next-generation management system
    that aims to have all operational processes and tasks executed automatically [[37](#CR37)].
    AI-based approaches are seen as likely implementation technologies to realize
    these architectures. Such ZSM architectures are already being proposed in wireless
    networks [[38](#CR38)]. Zero-trust networks evolve the cybersecurity paradigms
    to move defences from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets
    and resources. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets
    or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local
    area networks versus the Internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or
    personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device)
    are discrete functions performed before establishing a session with a resource.
    There are already proposals for zero-trust architectures for 5G healthcare applications
    [[39](#CR39)]. These architectural trends towards *autonomy*, *zero touch* and
    *zero trust* are expected to continue as a response to networking requirements.
    Blockchain infrastructures seem to provide an approach to address some of these
    requirements.

    intelligent network management in the context of sharing unlicensed 5G spectrum
    and infrastructure. This approach relied on a novel blockchain token corresponding
    to 180 kHz of the unlicensed spectrum resource being managed. This approach did
    not address the breadth of network management challenges in 5G and 6G, nor does
    it account for other users of unlicensed spectrum that may be non-cooperative.
    In a broader survey on the convergence of Blockchain and 5G, Nguyen, Pathirana,
    Ding and Seneviratne [[41](#CR41)] identified roles for blockchains in 5G enabling
    technologies (e.g., NFV-SDN), 5G services and 5G IoT applications. Management
    roles identified for blockchains included spectrum management, interference management
    and resource management. [[42](#CR42)] surveyed a broad range of ideas related
    to Blockchain integration in 5G and beyond networks that address issues such as
    interoperability, security, mobility, resource allocation, resource sharing and
    management, energy efficiency and other desirable features and proposed a taxonomy
    of blockchain for 5G categorizing applications as network management, computing
    management, communication management, security and privacy, applications and services.
    This taxonomy reflects a very narrow scope of network management (only SDN, NFV
    and network slicing), while many of the other categories identified are also involved
    in the operation, administration maintenance and provisioning of the infrastructure
    to meet the business objectives of the operator. When comparing different architectural
    approaches for network management, the availability of suitable metrics is helpful
    for comparing the effectiveness of divergent solutions. Wang Lu et al. [[43](#CR43)]
    provide an example of such an evaluation comparing operational quality in the
    context of specific centralized and decentralized network management architectures.
    Unfortunately, the decentralization approach they chose was based on a traditional
    geographic hierarchy rather than a blockchain. The operators increased need for
    mechanisms to assure trust in data, operations and commercial transactions while
    maintaining business continuity through software and equipment failures and cyberattacks
    provide further motivations for blockchain-based approaches.

    are required for successful applications of the technology. The application functionality
    needs to be allocated between the blockchain system and other components. Crowcroft
    [[44](#CR44)] suggests considering the performance requirements (e.g., transaction
    throughput, latency) before selecting blockchains as other architectures have
    higher transaction performance. Large-scale applications using blockchains are
    likely to move significant computation and storage tasks off-chain [[45](#CR45)].
    Others [[46](#CR46)–[48](#CR48)] have proposed more rigorous methodologies for
    selecting the appropriate blockchains aligned to application characteristics and
    requirements. After understanding the application requirements and characteristics,
    an evaluation can then be made of the degree of support provided by various alternative
    blockchains infrastructures in areas such as permissioned versus permissionless
    architecture, consensus mechanism selection, performance objectives and scaling
    considerations. Blockchains operate using distributed ledgers to record transactions
    of tokens. The design considerations need to include the token life cycles and
    the binding mechanism between those tokens and underlying assets. In the context
    of decentralized network management, either those tokens are associated with the
    network asset being managed or the network management task becomes the administration
    of the blockchain itself. The use of design patterns is a common practice in engineering.
    Design patterns for network architectures are more commonly discussed than network
    management design patterns. [[49](#CR49)] discussed APIs for NMIs and the need
    for application frameworks, describe and illustrate the pattern system underlying
    the Layla framework, detail three of its key patterns, and put the pattern system
    into perspective. Design patterns for applications based on blockchains are also
    starting to emerge [[50](#CR50)–[52](#CR52)]. In the case of blockchains deployed
    for trust assurance, design patterns for business and trust models are also needed.
    Trust patterns for collaborative business processes are also starting to emerge
    [[53](#CR53)]. While blockchains have demonstrated considerable potential, further
    maturity is required for commercial practice in the network context. Given the
    plethora of proposals, it seems reasonable to expect maturity of the technology
    and design practices by the time of 6G deployments.

    While several blockchains support smart contracts, there is a cost to doing so
    in the internal bandwidth, block storage and compute resources required to support
    these smart contracts. In many cases, off-chain computations or storage may be

    end-to-end service assurance objectives. Smart contracts were originally proposed
    in the context of decentralized finance applications where they could automate
    the execution of portions of financial contracts. Smart contracts are not self-activating;
    they only act in response to a transaction on the blockchain. Oracles are required

    context, the potential volume of events to be monitored and off-chain devices

    have skilfully managed multiple technology transitions in their infrastructure—1G
    (analog)- > 2G (digital), 2G (circuit)- > 3G (packet) and 3G (voice)- > 4G (video).
    5G marked a more radical shift by catering to diverse requirements of several
    use cases. These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications,
    Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. 4G - > 5G transitions
    the infrastructure from physical - > virtualized and the predominant usage from
    humans with cell phones - > IoT devices. Several technologies, such as software-defined
    networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing,
    are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil these diverse requirements.
    These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization,
    transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues,
    Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its distributed architecture
    capabilities including transparency, data encryption, auditability and immutability.

- en: The operation of communication infrastructure is business with significant scale
    effects. The value of the network scales increases with size, as do the cost and
    complexity of managing it. Evolution at scale is still an issue in the 6G era
    as operators seek to deliver value through an increasingly dynamic and diverse
    set of services while managing the costs of the underlying infrastructure. The
    decentralization of functionality to the edge (e.g., edge computing) exacerbates
    this challenge by increasing the number of locations where operational tasks need
    to be performed. While virtualization of many network functions enables more automated
    network management, there are still significant scale impacts. Consider the scale
    of the problem associated with managing software updates for VNFs. A typical VNF
    may have a development life cycle supporting updates every 6 months, with perhaps
    some emergency patches at more frequent intervals if security issues are found.
    For an edge node supporting a marketplace of 100 different types of VNFs to support
    the different services offered, it implies the average interval between software
    update operations on VNF types is < 2 days. If each VNF type has 100 operating
    instances in the edge computing node, then the average interval between updating
    instances is < 1/2 h. For a national scale operator with say 10,000 edge nodes
    located by cell towers, the scale of automation required to maintain the infrastructure
    at the latest release becomes obvious. This does not consider the additional administrative
    burden of moves, adds and changes, or new service deployments. The required level
    of automation is increasingly driven by AI. Managing AI operations at scale is
    a new competency that operators will need to develop. The performance of various
    blockchain architectures at scale is an ongoing area of blockchain research. The
    challenge for network operators comes from the variety of infrastructures—e.g.,
    a blockchain for settlements may not use the same underlying technology as a blockchain
    for IoT devices. Operators may need to manage multiple different decentralized
    infrastructures to support different network and business functions.

    VNF 可能具有支持每 6 个月进行更新的开发生命周期，如果发现安全问题，可能会在更频繁的间隔进行一些紧急修补。对于支持不同服务的 100 种不同类型的 VNF

    they attempt to “cover the waterfront”, i.e., maintain broad coverage of different
    services as a “one stop shop”; or specialize in one or more niches, and risk them
    being commoditized or overcome by changes in demand? The network management challenge
    increases as the number of services to be managed increases. Many communication
    services require extensive geographic coverage. Globalization trends and the recent
    pandemic have emphasized the importance of remote working capabilities, often

    the required geographic scope, and so inter-provider commercial relationships
    are required to provide the required functionality. Service requirement diversity
    increased the challenge of managing those commercial relationships—e.g., not all
    service providers will be able to provide all services as they make commercial
    decisions about which set of services to provide based on their resources, regulatory
    environment, competitive pressures, etc. The challenges of service requirement
    diversity add complexity to the network management task as these services become

    AI techniques have shown promise in managing the scale of the network management
    data collection and analysis problem. Blockchains have also shown promise as an
