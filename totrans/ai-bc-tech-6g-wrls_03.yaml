- en: The Internet has evolved from a fault-tolerant infrastructure to support both
    social networking and a semantic web for machine users. Trust in the data, and
    the infrastructure, has become increasingly important as cyber threats and privacy
    concerns rise. Communication services become increasingly delivered through virtualized,
    software-defined infrastructures, like overlays across multiple infrastructure
    providers. Increasing recognition of the need for services to be not only fault-tolerant
    but also censorship-resistant while delivering an increasing variety of services
    through a complex ecosystem of service providers drives the need for decentralized
    solutions like blockchains. Service providers have traditionally relied on contractual
    arrangements to deliver end-to-end services globally. Some of the contract terms
    can now be automated through smart contracts on blockchains. This is a complex
    distributed environment with multiple actors and resources. Blockchains are not
    only proposed for use at a business services level but also in the operation of
    the network infrastructure including dynamic spectrum management, SDN and resource
    management, metering and IoT services. Traditional approaches to network management
    have relied on client–server protocols and centralized architectures. Digital
    transformation at both network operators and many of their customers has led to
    a software-defined infrastructure for communication services, based on virtualized
    network functions. Decentralized approaches for network management have gained
    increasing attention from researchers. The operators increased need for mechanisms
    to assure trust in data, operations and commercial transactions while maintaining
    business continuity through software and equipment failures, and cyberattacks
    provide further motivations for blockchain-based approaches.

- en: The Internet has evolved from a fault-tolerant infrastructure to support both
    social networking and a semantic web for machine users. 6G radio technologies
    bring network performance improvements (e.g., in bandwidth and latency) that promise
    not only performance improvements for existing applications but also the possibility
    of enabling new types of applications at scale. Haptic technologies are perhaps
    the most easily recognizable new category of applications because they bring a
    new sensory mechanism (touch) to communications. Touch is a human sensory mechanism,
    but machine users of the Internet have different communication needs. The scale
    of deployments and breadth of applications for machine uses of network technologies
    are larger than human communication deployments, and billions of devices are already
    deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT). Human communication through networks
    has evolved through telegraph, voice, video and now haptic services requiring
    significantly more data. The data generated and analysed through distributed IoT
    devices is also expected to grow significantly [[1](#CR1)]. Progress in analytics,
    and semantic annotation of available data, also supports increased machine uses
    of communication services. The law of large numbers dictates that failures are
    inevitable in systems of this scale. Sophisticated architectures and redundant
    deployments have largely constrained the scope of physical failures. As communications
    have become more data-centric, and used by machines rather than humans, issues
    related to data failures (e.g., incomplete, improperly formatted, unverifiable
    and untrustworthy data) become more problematic.

    as cyber threats and privacy concerns rise. Trust and reputation have historically
    been human evaluations, but these concepts are increasingly applied in computational
    and communication contexts. Trust in wireless networks has been studied for more
    than 10 years [[2](#CR2)]. Trust is an increasingly important characteristic of
    IoT applications [[3](#CR3)]. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have become
    increasingly important in evaluating trust computationally [[4](#CR4)]. Blockchains
    have also gained broad attention as a trust machine design pattern. Trust is critical
    in the uncertain and evolving relationships between entities. As applications,
    including network management, evolve from centralized monolithic architectures
    towards decentralized microservice architectures, the number of communicating
    entities necessarily increases and so does the importance of trust in those communications.
    Network management is not just the trustworthiness of the data it consumes, but
    also the management of trust relationships required for the proper operation of
    the infrastructure.

- en: Communication services become increasingly delivered through virtualized, software-defined
    infrastructures, like overlays across multiple infrastructure providers. Virtualized
    infrastructures are based on some model or abstraction of the underlying resources.
    That model may have limited accuracy, precision or range of operating validity.
    The underlying resources are multidimensional (e.g., computing, storage and bandwidth),
    distributed and heterogeneous in nature. While there have been significant theoretical
    efforts associated with optimizing these resources, experimental approaches to
    characterizing the resources can also be expedient [[5](#CR5)]. Software-defined
    infrastructures enable automated configuration of those infrastructures, but the
    optimal degree of configurability and level of resource granularity remain open
    issues [[6](#CR6)]. This has not, however, precluded applications of large-scale
    virtualized infrastructures in 5G [[7](#CR7)]. Traditional networks have always
    required multiple operators to provide a global infrastructure. 5G networks. The
    higher bandwidths of 5G (and 6G) come through higher frequency carriers at a trade-off
    of a more limited range, resulting in a bias towards deployments of small cells
    as infrastructure. A variety of different business models have been proposed to
    support large-scale deployments of small cells [[8](#CR8)]. The net result seems
    likely to be an increased number of infrastructure providers that need to be dynamically
    assembled in order to provide global services. This adds to the complexity of
    the tasks in the management of such external, decentralized resources.

    but also censorship-resistant, while delivering an increasing variety of services
    through a complex ecosystem of service providers, drives the need for decentralized
    solutions like blockchains. Communication infrastructures have been designed and
    developed to be resilient in the face of a wide variety of physical and environmental
    disasters (e.g., hurricanes, tornados). As the global economy has become more
    data-driven, it has become more sensitive not just to infrastructure availability
    but also to the validity of the information being passed. Censorship of communications
    for political, commercial or personal reasons can be viewed as an attack on the
    integrity of the information infrastructure, but the scope and scale of such attacks
    is a subject of ongoing study [[9](#CR9)]. These types of attacks seem likely
    to increase rather than fade away, and hence infrastructure architectural approaches
    that provide resilience in the face of censorship attacks seem likely to be needed
    in the 6G context. Blockchain infrastructures have been proposed as a mechanism
    to provide some degree of censorship resistance. Whether through deletion or distortion
    of data, censorship is a fundamental threat to communication integrity. Detecting,
    measuring and controlling such threats is a significant challenge for communication
    networks to manage.

    end-to-end services globally. With 6G, the variety of services and the number
    of service providers are both expected to increase. This leads to pressure for
    automated mechanisms for service providers to dynamically assemble the required
    service partners to deliver services to their customers. With the rise of IoT
    and other machine users, APIs and other automation become necessary to enable
    service delivery. Blockchains have been proposed as a mechanism for financial
    settlements between remote parties. Some of the contract terms (e.g., liquidated
    damages in the event of service failures) can now be automated through smart contracts
    on blockchains. Automation in the contracting for service invocation and modification
    (e.g., via APIs) may be a novelty for communication services today. As the proportion
    of machine users increases in 6G, however, it becomes more of a necessity. This
    automation of contracting activities increases the scope of network management
    responsibilities.

    is a complex task. Virtualization of infrastructure enables data-driven automation.
    Without trustworthy data to drive that software automation, the management operations
    of the service provider can be subverted. Automation can also exacerbate the scope
    and scale of failures. Carefully targeted automation can help overcome fragility
    in the infrastructure. The inevitability of failures in large-scale systems emphasizes
    the importance of automated mechanisms for failover and service restoral. Decentralization
    eliminates the single point of failure in centralized systems. With 5G deployments

    in 6G requires an understanding of the 6G context. The following section provides
    an overview of 6G with an emphasis on the scope of the resource and service management
    required. Section [3](#Sec3) reviews the evolution of decentralized network management
    technologies and architectures. Blockchain technology was initially developed
    to support fintech applications, particularly transactions between remote parties.
    While network management has always had an implied concern with operational costs,
    the use of blockchain infrastructure in communication markets is a disruptive
    approach to what have been heavily regulated markets. Economic models for network
    management in 6G are considered in Sect. [4](#Sec4). Smart contracts have been
    used to automate financial transactions. Section [5](#Sec5) considers the role
    of smart contracts and APIs in decentralized network management. Smart contracts
    are but one form of automation. The volume, variety, velocity, value and veracity
    of the data driving network management in large communication infrastructures
    is a clearly a big data problem requiring automated support. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) is often proposed as a mechanism to support automation in the context of
    big data problems. The role of AI in decentralized network management is reviewed
    in Sect. [6](#Sec6). While blockchain approaches may be promising, that does not
    mean they are without challenges in their design, implementation and operation.
    Section [7](#Sec7) looks at the challenges for network operators in decentralizing
    network management with blockchains. Conclusions are then presented in Sect. [8](#Sec8).

    in terms of infrastructure and the commercial environment. 5G infrastructures
    have already evolved into a complex distributed environment with multiple actors.
    Communication infrastructure has evolved from service-specific infrastructures

- en: As the complexity of the infrastructure and business environment has grown,
    network management has been evolving from managing devices to more abstract models—managing
    resources and services. The initial data models and information models were very
    focused on device capabilities, but virtualization of the infrastructure through
    NFV/SDN brought increased abstraction from the underlying hardware, and software
    implementations executing on generic computing infrastructure. Industry forums
    have specified and standardized new network management architectures based on
    Software Defined Network, Network Function Virtualization, and orchestration or
    automation of many networks provisioning functions [[10](#CR10)]. The scope of
    network management includes not only the physical layer (radio, fibre, etc.) infrastructure
    but also the virtualized network functions and the computing infrastructure they
    execute in. The range of infrastructure functions being automated or orchestrated
    is expected to increase in the context of 6G. These new paradigms have had a great
    impact on the legacy Network Management Systems and the Operations Support System
    (OSS). The increased complexity of the business environment required more automation
    of business support services associated with operating the commercial infrastructure
    (e.g., quoting, ordering and billing). Industry responded with architectural frameworks
    such as TMFs Open Digital Architecture (ODA) [[11](#CR11)] and the more service-specific
    Lifecycle Service Orchestration (LSO) from the MEF [[12](#CR12)]. Frameworks like
    these help enable end-to-end automation across multiple service providers—including
    those delivering services through 5G and 6G wireless interfaces. The new spectrum
    deployed for 5G and 6G is at higher frequencies, with a correspondingly shorter
    range, favouring small cells. The specialized services in 5G and the small cell
    focus reinforce private network deployment models rather than basic wide-area
    public services. The need to deliver end-to-end services through a variety of
    private networks reinforces the need for these architectural frameworks in the
    6G context. The scope of services to be managed in the infrastructure includes
    not only the traditional connectivity services but also these additional automated
    business support functions.

    in 6G. Virtualization of the infrastructure with NFV-SDN makes prevalent the concepts
    of network overlays, network underlays and network slices. Blockchain implementations
    of SDN controllers have been proposed for increased security [[13](#CR13)]. The
    option of virtualized infrastructure also enables virtual operators that rely
    on under infrastructure service providers. Current NFV-SDN implementations enable
    network slicing, but are not adapted to support business agreements among mobile
    network operators (MNOs). The variety of services provided in the current 4G network
    already includes content services (e.g., video) and security services (e.g., Identity
    Management). The increasing deployment of IoT devices and edge computing can be
    expected to increase the requirement for service providers to offer a variety
    of non-traditional, trusted services. The new services in 5G and 6G (e.g., URLLC)
    use network slices to target industry verticals such as automobiles or smart cities.
    Network slices can be independently administered, adding complexity to the network
    management scope [[14](#CR14)]. As these service-specific network slices reach
    deployment and maturity, these new forms of service diversity add further variety
    to the business models that may need to be supported by the service provider.
    Increasingly diverse, and dynamic, business models are expected, with many service
    providers relying on other service providers to deliver end-to-end services. In
    this 6G context, service management, not just resource management, becomes increasingly
    required for end-to-end services to be provisioned, assured and appropriate revenue
    collected by the parties involved. Blockchain approaches have been proposed for
    a variety of billing and settlement use cases [[15](#CR15)]. Industry standards
    to support such blockchain use cases are also starting to emerge [[16](#CR16)]
    as are open-source implementations [[17](#CR17)]. Service fragmentation in 6G
    creates a more complex commercial environment requiring a corresponding increase
    in the scope of network management required to deliver those services.

- en: Network management’s scope has traditionally included categories such as Fault,
    Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security (FCAPS). Service assurance
    in this context has traditionally devolved to availability, but that may no longer
    be adequate for 6G. Governments, enterprises and individuals are becoming increasingly
    dependent on data-driven information systems. Information access design patterns
    are also trending to embrace zero-trust network architectures [[18](#CR18)]. Such
    approaches required finer grained controls over data access. Such controls also
    need to be managed efficiently at scale. With cybersecurity threats on the rise,
    the risk of data tampering, poisoning or censorship gains increasing attention
    as well as privacy risks associated with unauthorized or unwelcome data exposures.
    These can be viewed as failures of the information infrastructure. In the 6G era,
    it seems that service providers will need to provide network management service
    assurance beyond availability including aspects such as identities, trustworthiness
    and censorship resistance. The scope of 6G network management needs to expand
    to include the trustworthiness and censorship resistance of the data underlying
    the delivered services and the various identities engaged in service delivery.
    The scope of 6G network management responsibility in configuration and accounting
    may remain like current practices; albeit with new resources and services to be
    configured and accounted for. The scope of network management responsibilities
    in fault, performance and security would seem to be increased with attention to
    new dimensions for data resources and services. 6G network management will require
    new metrics, measurement and control techniques to provide service assurances
    in data dimensions such as privacy, trustworthiness and censorship resistance.

    network infrastructure including dynamic spectrum management, SDN and resource
    management, metering and IoT services. [[19](#CR19)] proposed a unified SDN and
    blockchain architecture with enhanced spectrum management features for enabling
    seamless user roaming capabilities between MNOs. [[20](#CR20)] proposed a tokenized
    model for sharing spectrum and infrastructure using smart contracts. Centralized
    approaches to network management provide operational efficiencies by aggregating
    analysis and control for a single service provider. The infrastructure scale and
    service complexity expected in the 6G era argue for network management perspectives
    being available to the multiple parties required for service delivery. With multiple
    parties required to cooperate for service delivery, mechanisms are needed to support
    trust and consensus in operations. In this context, traditional centralized network
    management approaches seem likely to be displaced by more decentralized network

    blockchain technology. For the purpose of scoping the 6G network management tasks,

    ways, while 6G is associated with radio infrastructure for wireless services.
    Much of the core network infrastructure has traditionally been non-radio communication
    infrastructure. In addition, the introduction of NFV brings computing infrastructure
    resources into the purview of network management, and edge computing exacerbates
    this trend. Blockchain has been proposed for resource management and sharing in
    6G using multiple application scenarios, including Internet of Things, device-to-device
    communications, network slicing and inter-domain blockchain ecosystems [[22](#CR22)].
    6G infrastructure resources will need to include a large base of non-radio communication
    infrastructure, 6G radio resources and 6G computational resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Network management resources of non-radio communication infrastructure in the
    6G era are traditional network management resources. Communication links (e.g.,
    fibre optics) and switches or routers provide a traditional layer 2 and 3 connectivity
    between the cell towers, small cells and other nodes of 6G architectures. Information
    models for these resources are well developed in the industry. Multiple centralized
    protocols (e.g., SNMP) exist for operating networks based on these information
    models. These resources are typically managed by a single operator. Non-radio
    communication infrastructure is expected to remain a significant infrastructure
    base providing connectivity and other services to 6G radio resources at the edges.

- en: Network management of 6G radio resources provides the opportunity for management
    of dedicated (licensed) spectrum as well as shared (unlicensed) spectrum. Spectrum
    licensing has allocated frequency bands within specified geographic areas to specific
    service providers. These independent frequency band selections in different geographic
    areas provide a basis for decentralized solutions. Unlicensed spectrum may be
    used by multiple parties—typically accepting the risk of interference. Even licensed
    spectrum may not always be used—offering the potential for innovation. To leverage
    such spectrum whitespace typically requires regulatory or licensing changes, and
    also, coordination mechanisms to reduce interference. The deployment of small
    cells, particularly in private networks, provides a specific context for spectrum
    sharing that seems likely to be prevalent in 6G. Blockchain mechanisms have been
    proposed for spectrum sharing. [[23](#CR23)] proposed blockchains as a trusted
    mechanism for spectrum sharing between the multiple network operators. The large-scale
    deployment of IoT infrastructure is also driven by multiple parties in a distributed
    and decentralized pattern. ITU-T Y.4464 provides a framework for a Blockchain
    of Things as a decentralized service platform [[24](#CR24)]. Network management
    of 6G radio resources seems likely to require decentralized solutions.

    a new resource type for some communication service providers. Management of cloud
    computing resources is, however, a well-known technology. Cloud computing is typically
    a centralized resource, and several service providers have developed their own
    cloud infrastructure or leveraged public cloud infrastructures. Edge computing,
    however, creates a new, and more decentralized, computing resource deployment
    to support data-intensive, low-latency 6G services. Physical computing resources
    may be centralized in data centres or distributed at the edge. The service provider
    may operate the computing resources directly, or outsource this to another (e.g.,
    cloud) service provider. The service provider may deploy VNFs for its own services
    in those computing resources or offer them to other service providers. 6G services
    targeting lower latency typically require additional edge computing resources.
    Network management of decentralized 6G computational resources will become a necessary
    operational skill for service providers delivering data-intensive, low-latency

    Beyond life cycle operations, the quality of the services delivered also needs

    techniques. Management of connectivity-based communication services (e.g., ethernet,
    Internet) is business as usual for most service providers today. These services
    primarily require partners to assist with the scope and scale of market coverage.
    More complex, data-intensive services may require additional partners to provide
    necessary functions. Scaling delivery may also require additional partners to

    customized network configurations optimized for specific industries. These often
    include additional design and assurance aspects to be compliant with industry-specific
    guidelines. With the advent of 5G verticals and the Internet of Things paradigm,
    Edge Computing has emerged as the most dominant service delivery architecture,
    placing augmented computing resources in the proximity of end users. The resource
    orchestration of edge clouds relies on the concept of network slicing, which provides
    logically isolated computing and network resources. The orchestration of multi-domain
    infrastructure or multi-administrative domain is still an open challenge. Reference
    [[25](#CR25)] proposes a blockchain-based service orchestrator that leverages
    the automation capabilities of smart contracts to establish cross-service communication
    between network slices of different tenants. They also introduce a multi-tier
    architecture of a Blockchain-based network marketplace, and design the life cycle
    of the cross-service orchestration. By customizing services to industry verticals,
    service providers deliver greater value at the cost of having to manage a greater
    number of more complex services. Since these industry vertical services are not
    collocated, the infrastructure necessarily becomes more fragmented and decentralized.
    Industry vertical services imply increased scale, complexity and decentralization
    of the network management tasks the service provider needs to deliver these services.
    Figure [1](#Fig1) illustrates the increasing complexity of service provider relationships.
    In Fig. [1](#Fig1)a, the client relationship with the service provider is the
    major focus, but this assumes that a single service provider can meet the client’s
    needs. For more global services (e.g., Internet), collaboration across multiple
    service providers is needed and this has traditionally been achieved through manual
    curation of a set of commercial relationships by the service provider, who then
    masks these relationships from the consumer as shown in Fig. [1](#Fig1)b. As the
    variety of services becomes both more fragmented (with more types of service providers)
    and more dynamic (e.g., transactional rather than subscription), the commercial
    trust relationships become more complex and dynamic. Emerging crowdsourced infrastructure
    (e.g., Helium network, [https://​www.​helium.​com](https://www.helium.com)) provides
    an early example of the increasing variety of service providers (as shown in Fig. [1](#Fig1)c)

    Many 5G, and 6G, services are also provided for machines—e.g., IoT devices. The

- en: Decentralized approaches for network management have gained increasing attention
    from researchers. In 1997, Baldi et al. [[27](#CR27)] recognized the rigidity
    of centralized client–server architectures for network management, but they approached
    the problem of decentralized network management by emphasizing code mobility as
    a design paradigm. Mobile agents performing network management distribute some
    of the data collection bandwidth and data processing but do not provide a consolidated
    view of the network resources and services being managed. In 2009, Brunner et
    al. [[28](#CR28)] proposed a probabilistic paradigm for decentralized network
    management. This probabilistic approach was targeted at reducing network resources
    associated with not only the collection and analysis of network data, but even
    the authors were somewhat sceptical of the acceptability of such an approach for
    network operators who are used to more deterministic network management systems
    as well as risk-averse due to regulatory penalties from infrastructure outages.

    level abstraction of network resources. While policy-based management is not new
    [[29](#CR29)], recent trends in policy-based management have been towards capturing
    and structuring policies to capture the operational intent. There is little work
    which empirically analyses network management practice with respect to policy
    creation and maintenance. Reference [[30](#CR30)] carried out semi-structured
    interviews of network administrators to identify dimensions for network policy
    including User, Device, Locus, Traffic features, Physical location, Temporality,
    Authentication and Trigger Action. Much of the recent policy- based network management
    work has been targeting intent with domain-specific, declarative languages to
    capture the policies. This trend was intensified by digital transformation and
    virtualization efforts at both network operators and many of their customers,
    starting around 2012\. This digital transformation has led to a software-defined
    infrastructure for communication services, based on virtualized network functions.
    Valocchi et al. [[31](#CR31)] proposed recognizing the increased complexity of
    centralized network management in the context of virtualized network functions
    and software-defined network infrastructures. They proposed a signalling framework
    to support decentralized management and control of virtualized communication infrastructure.
    While this approach partitioned the workload amongst local controllers, it lacks
    the consensus mechanisms of blockchains for coherent views of resources—especially
    shared resources. Policy-based approaches for network management remain an important
    strategy for developing the necessary abstractions to manage the scale, and diversity
    of modern communication infrastructures.

    network architectures beyond fixed wireless. New network architectures such as
    peer-to-peer networking, mobile ad hoc networking, delay-tolerant networking and
    pervasive computing networks. Many of these network architectures are distributed
    and self-organized leading some to refer to them as autonomous networks [[32](#CR32)].
    Autonomy in networks is often conflated with the use of artificial intelligence,
    particularly run-time learning behaviours [[33](#CR33)]. While significant strides
    in artificial intelligence have been made in recent years, cognitive autonomous
    networks have several areas requiring further research [[34](#CR34)]. Measuring
    the various dimensions of autonomy is not a simple task as these dimensions are
    often derived from social or psychological studies of human behaviour rather than
    the physics underlying most network engineering. Some blockchain structures, Decentralized
    Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), are designed to operate autonomously [[35](#CR35)].
    Autonomous networks are emerging from a research topic to industrialization among
    commercial service providers [[36](#CR36)]. The complexity in operating and managing
    5G and beyond networks has reinforced a trend towards closed-loop automation of
    network and service management operations. ETSI Zero-touch network and Service
    Management (ZSM) framework is envisaged as a next-generation management system
    that aims to have all operational processes and tasks executed automatically [[37](#CR37)].
    AI-based approaches are seen as likely implementation technologies to realize
    these architectures. Such ZSM architectures are already being proposed in wireless
    networks [[38](#CR38)]. Zero-trust networks evolve the cybersecurity paradigms
    to move defences from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets
    and resources. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets
    or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local
    area networks versus the Internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or
    personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device)
    are discrete functions performed before establishing a session with a resource.
    There are already proposals for zero-trust architectures for 5G healthcare applications
    [[39](#CR39)]. These architectural trends towards *autonomy*, *zero touch* and
    *zero trust* are expected to continue as a response to networking requirements.
    Blockchain infrastructures seem to provide an approach to address some of these
    requirements.

- en: Maksymyuk et al. [[40](#CR40)] proposed the use of blockchain mechanisms for
    intelligent network management in the context of sharing unlicensed 5G spectrum
    and infrastructure. This approach relied on a novel blockchain token corresponding
    to 180 kHz of the unlicensed spectrum resource being managed. This approach did
    not address the breadth of network management challenges in 5G and 6G, nor does
    it account for other users of unlicensed spectrum that may be non-cooperative.
    In a broader survey on the convergence of Blockchain and 5G, Nguyen, Pathirana,
    Ding and Seneviratne [[41](#CR41)] identified roles for blockchains in 5G enabling
    technologies (e.g., NFV-SDN), 5G services and 5G IoT applications. Management
    roles identified for blockchains included spectrum management, interference management
    and resource management. [[42](#CR42)] surveyed a broad range of ideas related
    to Blockchain integration in 5G and beyond networks that address issues such as
    interoperability, security, mobility, resource allocation, resource sharing and
    management, energy efficiency and other desirable features and proposed a taxonomy
    of blockchain for 5G categorizing applications as network management, computing
    management, communication management, security and privacy, applications and services.
    This taxonomy reflects a very narrow scope of network management (only SDN, NFV
    and network slicing), while many of the other categories identified are also involved
    in the operation, administration maintenance and provisioning of the infrastructure
    to meet the business objectives of the operator. When comparing different architectural
    approaches for network management, the availability of suitable metrics is helpful
    for comparing the effectiveness of divergent solutions. Wang Lu et al. [[43](#CR43)]
    provide an example of such an evaluation comparing operational quality in the
    context of specific centralized and decentralized network management architectures.
    Unfortunately, the decentralization approach they chose was based on a traditional
    geographic hierarchy rather than a blockchain. The operators increased need for
    mechanisms to assure trust in data, operations and commercial transactions while
    maintaining business continuity through software and equipment failures and cyberattacks
    provide further motivations for blockchain-based approaches.

    are required for successful applications of the technology. The application functionality
    needs to be allocated between the blockchain system and other components. Crowcroft
    [[44](#CR44)] suggests considering the performance requirements (e.g., transaction
    throughput, latency) before selecting blockchains as other architectures have
    higher transaction performance. Large-scale applications using blockchains are
    likely to move significant computation and storage tasks off-chain [[45](#CR45)].
    Others [[46](#CR46)–[48](#CR48)] have proposed more rigorous methodologies for
    selecting the appropriate blockchains aligned to application characteristics and
    requirements. After understanding the application requirements and characteristics,
    an evaluation can then be made of the degree of support provided by various alternative
    blockchains infrastructures in areas such as permissioned versus permissionless
    architecture, consensus mechanism selection, performance objectives and scaling
    considerations. Blockchains operate using distributed ledgers to record transactions
    of tokens. The design considerations need to include the token life cycles and
    the binding mechanism between those tokens and underlying assets. In the context
    of decentralized network management, either those tokens are associated with the
    network asset being managed or the network management task becomes the administration
    of the blockchain itself. The use of design patterns is a common practice in engineering.
    Design patterns for network architectures are more commonly discussed than network
    management design patterns. [[49](#CR49)] discussed APIs for NMIs and the need
    for application frameworks, describe and illustrate the pattern system underlying
    the Layla framework, detail three of its key patterns, and put the pattern system
    into perspective. Design patterns for applications based on blockchains are also
    starting to emerge [[50](#CR50)–[52](#CR52)]. In the case of blockchains deployed
    for trust assurance, design patterns for business and trust models are also needed.
    Trust patterns for collaborative business processes are also starting to emerge
    [[53](#CR53)]. While blockchains have demonstrated considerable potential, further
    maturity is required for commercial practice in the network context. Given the
    plethora of proposals, it seems reasonable to expect maturity of the technology
    and design practices by the time of 6G deployments.

    a commercial rather than purely technical decision. Commercial evaluations for
    deployment consider not only technical design choices but also an evaluation of
    the company’s ability to deliver, operate and maintain the solution. Readiness
    models [[54](#CR54)] or maturity models [[55](#CR55)] have been used to measure
    organizational readiness for transformative technology deployments. Blockchain
    network management systems would certainly be a transformative technology deployment,
    but I am not aware of any widely accepted maturity models for organizational readiness
    to support blockchain deployments. Blockchain software engineering is an emerging
    area of technical expertise where an industry consensus on the required technical
    skills, education and experience has not yet developed [[56](#CR56)]. From a commercial
    perspective, the identification and staffing of the appropriate technical capabilities
    is an important organizational prerequisite for the organizational maturity needed
    to successfully deploy blockchain solutions. Many blockchain solutions rely on
    open-source blockchain software. In such cases, the maturity of the community
    supporting the open-source blockchain also needs to be considered. Commercial
    judgements of organizational readiness and maturity are critical for successfully

    and sellers of, in this case, network management services. Most blockchains are
    designed to support transactions recorded in distributed ledgers. One approach
    to categorizing economic markets for network management in 6G is to look at the
    structure of the market in comparison with the organization boundary of the service
    provider. Here, we can distinguish between markets that are internal to a single
    service provider; markets where a single service provider offers its services;
    and markets for communication resources where multiple service providers operate
    as buyers and sellers.

    For regulatory, tax and other business reasons, service providers may choose to
    organize themselves into multiple internal organizations that provide services
    to each other. For example, a corporate holding company may have multiple legal
    entities operating in different jurisdictions; or form different organizations
    to market specific services. Internal markets are often centralized rather than
    decentralized. Because it is all one firm, there is less need for protocols to
    build trust.

- en: A recent trend has emerged for operators’ communication APIs, products and services
    to be made available to external users through digital marketplaces. While this
    provides an alternative channel for human users, these digital marketplaces become
    essential for machine users. Many of these network service offerings today are
    targeted at larger enterprises or government rather than consumer markets. Consider,
    for example, a connected vehicle that moves between the geographic coverage areas
    of different service providers. A more futuristic scenario might be a DAO that
    relies on an underlying communication infrastructure, periodically rebidding for
    communication services to optimize its ongoing business costs. In the context
    of such digital marketplaces, multiple actors are buying or selling network services
    creating a need for mechanisms to support the trustworthiness of those transactions.
    Settlements between service providers are already a commonplace activity from
    roaming voice services. Industry bodies have been developing standards [[16](#CR16)]
    and open-source implementations [[17](#CR17)] of blockchains to support these
    settlements. This provides some operational efficiency by eliminating external
    clearing houses for settlement activities. Such settlement arrangements can also

    are typically separated by the type of resource. Computing resources both in centralized
    clouds and in edge computing can be allocated using markets. Not all economic
    models provide the same benefits for users in utilizing the resources; nor in
    the profit earned by resource providers. Economic models can be effective in the
    collaborative use of large-scale heterogeneous resources that are typically owned
    by different organizations. Economic models may differ from one another as they
    are used for interaction among users and providers; they are used for pricing,
    and they adapt to evaluate different requirements. [[57](#CR57)] studied diverse
    market models for allocating resources in the context of grid computing including
    commodity market, double auction, English auction, bargaining, proportional share,
    proportional resource sharing, first price sealed bid and contract net protocol.
    Markets for networking resources or services can use any of these approaches,

    economics and operation of blockchain systems can significantly differ between
    permissioned (consortium) and permissionless (public) blockchain infrastructures.
    In the networking context, different markets may require different blockchain

    rely on tokens as a form of financial asset (e.g., a crypto currency, security
    or commodity). Tokens as financial assets imply a corresponding regulatory treatment
    as financial assets. Settlement applications in the telecom industry may use existing
    financial cryptocurrencies, but could also be designed to use some other more
    industry-specific usage measures (e.g., call data records of usage minutes, and
    bandwidth). Tokens for other more novel applications (e.g., spectrum sharing)
    could also be created. The token life cycle operations (e.g., creation, deletion,
    partition and transfer) can significantly affect the economic significance of
    the token. The regulatory classification of blockchain tokens is still emerging.
    Inadvertent regulatory classification of tokens could have significant unanticipated

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smart contracts are programs executing in a decentralized blockchain which permits
    them to leverage the underlying blockchain’s consensus mechanism to provide computation
    results with a degree of resilience to failures, tampering and censorship attempts.
    While several blockchains support smart contracts, there is a cost to doing so
    in the internal bandwidth, block storage and compute resources required to support
    these smart contracts. In many cases, off-chain computations or storage may be
    used for efficiency, with the blockchain primarily used to store signatures of
    the results of the computations. Note that off-chain computations may have additional
    requirements (e.g., for confidential computing technologies) in order to preserve
    end-to-end service assurance objectives. Smart contracts were originally proposed
    in the context of decentralized finance applications where they could automate
    the execution of portions of financial contracts. Smart contracts are not self-activating;
    they only act in response to a transaction on the blockchain. Oracles are required
    to bring off-chain events into the blockchain context. In the network management
    context, the potential volume of events to be monitored and off-chain devices
    to be controlled is significantly greater than the data series typically used
    for the standardized financial contracts (e.g., options contracts). Smart contracts
    operate on digital assets, tokens that are supported by the underlying blockchain.
    Those tokens can be associated with physical assets or other digital assets. The
    literature increasingly shows examples of blockchain smart contracts being used
    for network applications.

    finance applications. Smart contract applications for IoT have emerged as an important
    research category with network management implications. Smart contracts are usually

    Ethereum is the most frequently cited blockchain within the smart contract literature,
    but there are other blockchains (e.g., IOTA) which are more focused on IoT applications
    [[59](#CR59)]. Smart contracts have been proposed for a variety of networking-related
    tasks. These include spectrum sensing [[60](#CR60)], DDoS Mitigation [[61](#CR61)],
    distributed cloud storage [[62](#CR62)], VANETS [[63](#CR63)], software-defined
    networks [[64](#CR64)] and resource allocation [[65](#CR65)]. These network applications
    for blockchain smart contracts are increasingly relying on nonfinancial tokens,
    i.e., tokens associated with a network resource rather than a financial asset.

- en: Smart contracts were developed to provide automated execution of some financial
    terms in the context of a financial contract, but network operators are no strangers
    to automation. As a computational mechanism, smart contracts are significantly
    less efficient because of the decentralization and consensus mechanisms. That
    efficiency is traded off for the trust assertions available through the consensus
    process. A common design pattern from the financial industry is to use smart contracts
    in decentralized settlements rather than a centralized clearing house. Such settlement
    arrangements certainly exist today between service providers. Other decentralized
    applications and design patterns requiring a strong basis of trust are also starting
    to emerge in the network context. The increasing diversity of service partners,
    and the trend towards service invocation through APIs, argue for more automated
    mechanisms to assure trust in transactions. The trend towards zero-trust architectures
    also argues for decentralized identity and authorization services than can be
    invoked with smart contracts. Applying zero-trust architecture in the networks
    of the scale of IoT further drives towards automated mechanisms to build trust
    relationships. The need for an automated, large-scale mechanism to support trusted
    networking transactions between independent entities creates a basis for expecting
    the wider deployment of smart contracts.

    and bandwidth. Fibre optic technologies improved backbone bandwidth, while increased
    cellular coverage brought connectivity to greater populations. Network operators
    have skilfully managed multiple technology transitions in their infrastructure—1G
    (analog)- > 2G (digital), 2G (circuit)- > 3G (packet) and 3G (voice)- > 4G (video).
    5G marked a more radical shift by catering to diverse requirements of several
    use cases. These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications,
    Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. 4G - > 5G transitions
    the infrastructure from physical - > virtualized and the predominant usage from
    humans with cell phones - > IoT devices. Several technologies, such as software-defined
    networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing,
    are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil these diverse requirements.
    These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization,
    transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues,
    Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its distributed architecture
    capabilities including transparency, data encryption, auditability and immutability.

    effects. The value of the network scales increases with size, as do the cost and
    complexity of managing it. Evolution at scale is still an issue in the 6G era
    as operators seek to deliver value through an increasingly dynamic and diverse
    set of services while managing the costs of the underlying infrastructure. The
    decentralization of functionality to the edge (e.g., edge computing) exacerbates
    this challenge by increasing the number of locations where operational tasks need
    to be performed. While virtualization of many network functions enables more automated
    network management, there are still significant scale impacts. Consider the scale
    of the problem associated with managing software updates for VNFs. A typical VNF
    may have a development life cycle supporting updates every 6 months, with perhaps
    some emergency patches at more frequent intervals if security issues are found.
    For an edge node supporting a marketplace of 100 different types of VNFs to support
    the different services offered, it implies the average interval between software
    update operations on VNF types is < 2 days. If each VNF type has 100 operating
    instances in the edge computing node, then the average interval between updating
    instances is < 1/2 h. For a national scale operator with say 10,000 edge nodes
    located by cell towers, the scale of automation required to maintain the infrastructure
    at the latest release becomes obvious. This does not consider the additional administrative
    burden of moves, adds and changes, or new service deployments. The required level
    of automation is increasingly driven by AI. Managing AI operations at scale is
    a new competency that operators will need to develop. The performance of various
    blockchain architectures at scale is an ongoing area of blockchain research. The
    challenge for network operators comes from the variety of infrastructures—e.g.,
    a blockchain for settlements may not use the same underlying technology as a blockchain
    for IoT devices. Operators may need to manage multiple different decentralized

    increases as the number of services to be managed increases. Many communication

    pandemic have emphasized the importance of remote working capabilities, often
    across multiple time zones. No single service provider has the resources to meet
    the required geographic scope, and so inter-provider commercial relationships
    are required to provide the required functionality. Service requirement diversity
    increased the challenge of managing those commercial relationships—e.g., not all
    service providers will be able to provide all services as they make commercial
    decisions about which set of services to provide based on their resources, regulatory
    environment, competitive pressures, etc. The challenges of service requirement

    Latency is not the only performance metric of interest, but it does provide a
    challenge for many general-purpose blockchain systems. Spectrum availability and
    service diversification in the 6G context may exacerbate these trends resulting
    in an increasing diversity of 6G deployment locations and business models. Service

    will need further progress in these areas to support 6G infrastructures and services
    to support evolving consumer expectations for data trustworthiness.

- en: IoT traffic has taken on increasing importance with billions of devices deployed
    and new network services designed for them being deployed as part of 5G. A further
    expansion of IoT traffic sources and services is expected for additional types
    of machine users of communication services in 6G. Blockchains have been proposed
    as a mechanism to support the integrity of IoT infrastructures, while the scale
    of IoT infrastructure remains a network management challenge. Adequately designing
    and operating such blockchain systems requires an understanding of the threat
    models these blockchain systems are required to protect against. [[73](#CR73)]
    provided a detailed analysis of potential security attacks and presents existing
    blockchain solutions that can be deployed as countermeasures to such attacks,
    including blockchain security enhancement solutions. Identified blockchain security
    issues included transaction malleability, network security, privacy, redundancy,
    regulatory compliance, criminal activity and vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
    The scale of IoT infrastructures is a challenge for network management, driving
    the need for zero-touch network management capabilities. The network security
    challenges of such large-scale distributed IoT infrastructures drive towards zero-trust
    mechanisms to identify compromised devices and constrain the scope of further
    spread.

- en: The network security capabilities of today’s infrastructure have been developed
    using cryptography within the context of contemporary von Neuman computer architectures.
    6G era, however, is expected to start in the 2030s. By then, quantum computing
    technologies threaten the integrity of many current cryptographic algorithms.
    Quantum supremacy refers to the goal of using a quantum computer to solve a problem
    that no classical computer can solve in a reasonable amount of time. Several research
    teams have already claimed to have achieved examples of quantum supremacy. While
    current quantum computing capabilities may be limited, considerable progress in
    quantum computing technologies may be expected by 2030\. Network management, including
    blockchains, that relies on cryptography will need to transition to post-quantum
    cryptographic methods. This may imply additional costs for early movers than then
    need to update cryptographic software. This problem of needing post-quantum cryptographic
    methods, however, is not unique to blockchains. Network security is expected to
    remain a challenging part of network management, even in a decentralized context.

- en: Blockchains provide an infrastructure for smart contracts executing business
    logic code in a decentralized architecture. In this context, the execution outcomes
    have a basis for trust, agreed upon by the consensus of the executing nodes. Smart
    contracts can be viewed as a form of distributed computing; however, the software
    engineering body of knowledge to support professional practices in this area is
    still emerging. The design patterns and other practices for blockchain software
    engineering are expected to develop as blockchains are deployed, and operated,
    in a wide variety of environments. In multiparty environments, the standardization
    of data semantics and operational governance of systems are important matters
    to resolve. The communication industry is well used to the development of industry
    standardization to support such initiatives. Blockchains use oracles to adapt
    off-chain, external data sources and controls to their distributed architecture.
    Independent oracles as trusted data sources may be a new type of business partner
    required for some services. [[74](#CR74)] proposed a taxonomy for blockchain oracles
    classifying them based on the data source, trust model, design pattern and interaction
    model. The commercial roles and responsibilities may prove more challenging as
    decentralized architectures often imply significant reengineering of business
    processes. Coordinating such process reengineering across multiple parties during
    the migration of existing operating services to smart contracts on blockchain
    infrastructures could prove challenging for many operators.

- en: Blockchain-enabled decentralized network management is a disruptive change to
    existing network management processes. The scope and scale of the 6G network management
    challenge support the need for these types of network management architectures.
    The network context of the 6G era of the 2030s and beyond is expected to be more
    complex than current communication networks from both technology and commercial
    perspectives. As machine usage dominates over human usage, the services offered
    and their invocation methods become more data-centric. Even for human users, cybersecurity
    threats create a demand for service assurances that data is trustworthy, private
    and resistant to censorship attacks. Service fragmentation, resource variety and
    the resulting complexity in the 6G commercial environment reinforce the need for
    automated protocols to support trustworthy transactions at a massive network scale.
    AI techniques have shown promise in managing the scale of the network management
    data collection and analysis problem. Blockchains have also shown promise as an
    enabling technology for trustworthy transactions and censorship-resistant data.
    Both technical and commercial or organizational challenges remain before the wider
    adoption of these technologies. Blockchain-enabled decentralized network management
    provides a promising framework for considering the operational and administrative
    challenges expected in the 6G communication infrastructure.
