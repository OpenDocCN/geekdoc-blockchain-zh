    analysis, and it becomes very common since digital storage is feasible and inexpensive.
    The number of datasets for the health data is roughly figured by the USA as 150
    exabytes (10^(18)), and it is estimated beyond yottabyte (10^(24)) in the forthcoming
    years. Big data comprises a large volume of highly complex, variable data that
    demand advanced technologies to capture, store, distribute, manage, and analyze
    information (Glosarry, [2012](#CR7)). The main objective of big data is to analyze
    the available raw data in order to make sense for decision-making and exploit
    the values. Some of the big data characteristics are volume, variety, velocity,
    veracity, variability, and value that are described below (Gani et al., [2016](#CR6))

- en: The primary reason for cardiovascular disease  is the blockage in which the
    blood flow becomes obstructed or reduced at the time of travel via coronary arteries
    to the heart muscle. The red blood cells in the human body carry oxygen that is
    essential for humans to be conscious and remain sustained in their life. Without
    oxygen, it causes heart muscle to get arrested that leads to death. Smart devices
    acquire and send data for further analysis about the chronic diseases that provide
    information about the human heart, blood pressure or blood sugar, and breathing
    process and increase the ability in order to make appropriate decisions (Bui et
    al., [2011](#CR2)). A cardiologist receives data periodically about the patient,
    and occasionally the provider would be given an early warning regarding heart-related
    problems, in such a way that the heart disease can be prevented. An electrocardiogram
    (ECG)  is a reliable technology in predicting heart diseases and directs patients
    for rapid treatment in the aspect of restricting the impact of any serious condition.
    An electrochemical biosensor can be surgically implanted beneath the human body
    skin so that it can have a direct contact with the blood flow. The implanted sensor
    transmits troponin-related information via Bluetooth to analyze it in real time
    (Poongodi et al. [2020](#CR20), [b](#CR18), [c](#CR19)).

    the globe. With predictive analytics, there is a potential to enrich early detection,
    risk assessment, symptom tracking, and accuracy. According to the McKinsey report,
    50% of Americans are suffering from chronic diseases, and 80% of medical care
    fee amount is spent on treatment. On average, 2.7 trillion USD is spent on chronic
    disease treatment every year, and it comprises 18% of annual GDP. As per the nutrition
    and chronic disease of Chinese report in 2015, 86.6% of deaths occur due to chronic
    diseases. Thus, it is required to accomplish the risk assessment analysis for
    chronic diseases. Moreover, the diagnostic process is highly complex due to shortage
    of resources and physicians which has an impact on proper diagnosis and treatment.
    Based on the European Society of Cardiology report, 26 million patients were diagnosed
    with chronic heart diseases, and 3.6 million every year among themselves. In particular,
    50% of heart patients’ condition ends in death too in the beginning period of
    1 to 2 years, and the cost incurred for heart disease management is 3% approximately
    of the health budget.

    effectively to all parts of the body. The two categories of heart failure which
    affect the left side of the heart are systolic and diastolic heart failure. Systolic
    heart failure is also known as heart failure with less ejection fraction (HFrEF)
    which happens when the left ventricle is not contracting completely because of
    this, the heart will not pump the blood forcefully enough to all parts of the
    body. Ejection fraction (EF) is the quantity of blood that leaves a heart ventricle
    during every pumping action. For normal condition EF is between 50 and 70%, but
    under 40% is considered as less ejection fraction or systolic heart failure. Diastolic
    heart failure is also known as heart failure with conserved ejection fraction
    (HFpEF) which happens when there is no longer relaxation in the left ventricle
    between heartbeats. This failure makes the tissues of the heart stiffer, and the
    heart will not get filled up with blood before the next beat (Bui et al., [2011](#CR2)).
    Diastolic heart failure often occurs along with other types of heart diseases
    or non-heart diseases such as cancer and lung disease (Lopez-Sendon, [2011](#CR13)).
    The scenario of heart failure is depicted in Fig. [13.3](#Fig3).![../images/504166_1_En_13_Chapter/504166_1_En_13_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/504166_1_En_13_Chapter/504166_1_En_13_Fig3_HTML.png)

    benefits by all the stakeholders. Data analytical processing involves data acquisition,
    pre-processing, integration, analysis, interpretation, and applying algorithms
    to generate the output. Precise analysis and on-time diagnosis are vital to prevent
    heart failure and provide appropriate treatment for the heart diseases (Ebenezer
    & Durga, [2015](#CR3)). Diagnosing chronic diseases with traditional systems is
    not reliable, and adequate information could not be obtained to diagnose it efficiently.
    Some of the heart disease symptoms are physical body weakness, shortness in breathing,
    swollen feet, and fatigue with dizziness, caused by cardiac or non-cardiac abnormalities.
    The data available in the healthcare datasets are extremely complex because of
    inherent unstructured data (Suguna et al., [2017](#CR25)). The structured data
    can be the living habits, laboratory results, patient demographics, and the unstructured
    data including patient’s illness, medical history, and interrogation records.
    Identifying high-risk patients and directing them for appropriate medication are
    compulsory to minimize the medicine cost because they often need expensive healthcare.
    Biosensors like EMG, EEG, and ECG can be used for gathering and transmitting the
    health parameters to the server for processing. The sensing and deployment strategies
    of the human body sensors should be identified for collecting data about heart
    patients (Poongodi et al. [2020](#CR20), [b](#CR18), [c](#CR19)). The physiological
    parameters along with hidden symptoms of chronic diseases should be considered
    for disease prediction.

    powerful in maintaining the plenteous amount of information. Various clinical
    information sources include physician entries, clinical notes, imaging devices,
    etc. (Manikantan & Latha, [2013](#CR15)). The datasets available in the healthcare
    sector are particularly huge and complex that are also maintained to meet the
    regulatory and government compliances. The massive amount of healthcare data is
    inherently difficult to fragment that leads to complex investigation of various
    health-related issues  (Fang et al., [2016](#CR4)). If patients are provided with
    precise medical treatment, irregularity in medical services can be avoided, treatment
    quality is improved, and side effects are reduced. The medical equipment such
    as wearable devices acquire data continuously, and data generated in high velocity
    requires rapid processing in an emergency situation (Indrakumari et al., [2020](#CR10)).
    With healthcare applications, users are permitted to send symptomatic queries
    to the healthcare service providers via server. Patients could be immediately
    afforded with emergency assistance regarding the treatment process or directed
    to the concerned department for further processing (Panda et al., [2017](#CR17)).

    collected from multiple sources including sensor networks, streaming machines,
    instrumental throughput, mobile application, etc. It is highly complex to store,

    general population are being considered as input for the visualization system
    that ends in non-generalizable intuition. For example, the patient undergoing
    treatment in a private and public hospital is possibly not the same. In the context
    of selection bias, visualization focusing on a particular dataset may not obtain
    generalizable results. Hence, datasets must be constructed by considering the
    baseline samples in order to determine the generalization in result.

    K-means clustering algorithm provides low inter-class similarity and high intra-class
    similarity by minimizing the sum of squares distance from the centroid within
    the cluster. The given dataset is divided into K-clusters with reference to the
    centroid. The centroid is iteratively calculated to reduce the distance between
    the cluster center and the individual points. In this chapter, K-means clustering
    is used along with data analytics and visualization tool Tableau. K-means algorithm

- en: The chapter introduces big data in the context of healthcare by providing information
    to illustrate a clear vision from the base of big data to the use cases of big
    data using exploratory data analysis. The analysis of structured, unstructured,
    and voluminous data has given substantial discoveries. Big data recommends enormous
    promises to identify the nonlinearities and relations among variables. Major techniques
    and tools used in big data for healthcare analysis are discussed. Big data tools
    can foretell, prevent, and recommend the best evidence-based treatment for the
    patients by exploring data from the heterogeneous source. Many exciting opportunities
    are available using interactive data visualization in healthcare. This will create
    a close collaboration with healthcare researchers and practitioners to provide
    better diagnosis and treatment at low cost which in turn enhances patient outcomes.
    A well-designed decision support system exploiting machine learning algorithms
    will be more appropriate for heart disease diagnosis and prediction. By identifying
    most relevant features, the performance of the heart disease diagnosis system
    can be increased, and computation time can be decreased. Using feature selection
    algorithms, the best features can be chosen which automatically improves the accuracy
    and reduces the execution time as well. More experiments will be conducted in
    the future in order to increase the performance of prediction systems using different
    optimization techniques.
