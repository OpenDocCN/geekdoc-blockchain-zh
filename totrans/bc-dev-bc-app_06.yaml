- en: ConclusionEven though there has been tons of enthusiasm around Blockchain and
    how it shot up to the top spot in the tech world, there are analysts with pessimistic
    views. The biggest talking point is that it can turn pretty much any industry
    on its head. Blockchain promises to transform how we transact, how we enter into
    contracts and how we protect data. Analysts have likened Blockchain to the internet,
    stating that it could be more than twenty years before we see blockchain being
    a part of how businesses operate on a daily basis. If central authorities and
    businesses seriously invest in the infrastructure and rework how they operate,
    then we would be able to see more extensive use of blockchain technology.We cannot
    predict the future, but the prospective advantages of blockchain are at least
    fascinating enough for there to be some sort of insurgence far into the future.If
    you are just starting out on your software development journey, you can’t be too
    hard on yourself if you don’t grasp everything at lightning speed. If you learn
    with the end goal in mind, it will be a smoother process.Having the aptitude to
    fully understand blockchain and its concepts will always be an advantage to you.
    You may find yourself working on ICO projects. Initial Coin Offering is to the
    cryptocurrency industry what an IPO is to the business world. Companies use ICOs

    fairly new, so only 0.5% of the population is using it right now. If you start
    learning it today, you will be at the forefront of its development by the time
    it has gained more traction.The demand for Blockchain shot up almost 2000% and
    it became one of the most sought after skills in the tech industry. It is estimated
    that by 2024 the Blockchain market’s net worth will be valued at $20 billion.
    Right now, a significant number of banks are implementing Blockchain technology
    to improve the quality of their service and to tighten up their security.The cities
    with the most openings are New York, San Francisco and San Jose and the median
    salary for a blockchain developer stands at $154,550 as of 2022\. There is always
    room to grow in this field as the technology improves and advances. You should
    become a blockchain developer because:● The demand for Blockchain developers far
    outweighs the supply. This means the job market is not saturated and probably
    will not be for a long time.● The salaries are among some of the most competitive
    in the tech space right now. With the right amount of drive and experience, you
    could earn up to $200,000 a year.● You get to be involved in revolutionizing the
    way the financial market operates.A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners
