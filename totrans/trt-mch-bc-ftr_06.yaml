    on Netflix, beamed through your 65-inch Smart TV, that you’re just somebody who
    likes a good zombie story. What you don’t realize is, you’re a futurist, too.
    Because that Smart TV of yours is not just projecting a program beamed over the
    airwaves. It is one of more than 8 billion devices around the world that are plugged
    into the so-called Internet of Things, a vast network of devices like TVs, cars,
    electric meters, and security cameras that are programmed to exchange information,
    to “talk” to each other, in essence. You’ve probably been hearing about the IoT

    were produced in the years after World War II. Even twenty years ago, undergraduate
    students were able to make single semiconductor chips that had as much raw computing
    power as those room-sized computers. Today, everyday gadgets contain minuscule
    microprocessors with thousands of multitudes more power than the gargantuan, room-sized
    early computers. Information processing is no longer confined to single computers,
    and computation increasingly happens at the interconnection of computers. This
    is why the Internet of Things matters: it’s not that we’ve empowered billions
    of new devices to do computation per se; it’s that they are being connected with
    each other to create a computing colossus that’s infinitely larger than the sum
    of its parts. We’ve reached the point of truth for Sun Microsystems veteran John
    Gage’s famous quip that “the network is the computer.” As we discover ever more
    ways to harness the power of these systems, the processing capacity of that “everywhere
    computer” just keeps building upon itself with every new device plugged into the
    network. This is no small moment for society. Whether this power will be leveraged
    for the good of the people, or to their detriment, has yet to be determined. A

    a blockchain technology it calls Sawtooth Lake that builds on top of its pre-existing
    trusted computing module, known as Software Guard Extensions (SGX). The system
    is designed to be “blockchain agnostic,” meaning that it can be run on either
    a private, permissioned blockchain set up by a company or on a public, permissionless
    network of devices. A purist might argue, however, that Sawtooth’s dependence
    on Intel’s proprietary SGX trusted computing model diminishes the decentralization
    advantages of a permissionless system, since users must now trust Intel’s software.
    Nonetheless the capacity to incorporate IoT-specific protections into a permissionless

    car that needs to get somewhere in a hurry can make a small payment to another
    self-driving car to let it pass. As discussed, you’ll need a distributed trust
    system to verify the integrity of the transaction, which may involve a lot more
    information than just that of the money transfer before it can be processed—for
    example, you may need to know whether the overtaking car is certified as safe
    to drive at the faster speed, or whether one car’s software can be trusted not
    to infect the other with malware. These kinds of verifications, as well as that
    of the fund balance in the paying car’s wallet, could be run through a blockchain
    log to check the validity of each side’s claims, giving each the assurances they
    need without having to rely on some certifying central authority. The question,
    though, is: would this transaction be easily processed if it were based on a private
    blockchain? What are the chances, in a country of more than 230 million cars,
    that both vehicles would belong to the same closed network run by a group of permissioned
    validating computers? If they weren’t part of the same network, the payment couldn’t
    go through as the respective software would not be interoperable. Other car manufacturers
    might not want to use a permissioned verification system for which, say, GM, or
    Ford, is the gatekeeper. And if they instead formed a consortium of carmakers
    to run the system, would their collective control over this all-important data

- en: Here too, though, there are companies attacking the challenge. A startup called
    IOTA is using an unorthodox consensus algorithm that is intended to be less taxing
    on the computing network than a traditional blockchain. Within its so-called tangle
    system, each transacting device is also a validating node—unlike the contemporary
    Bitcoin dichotomy, which distinguishes users from miners. The way IOTA works is
    that in order for one device to make a transaction with another one—to send it
    money in the form of IOTA tokens or other forms of valuable information—it must
    itself confirm the validity of two randomly assigned transactions from elsewhere
    in the network. Two transactions out of millions is obviously a significantly
    lesser computing load than is faced by miners in Bitcoin and Ethereum, who must
    process all of those within a given block. It’s on this basis that IOTA makes
    its claim to scalability. But its success—and, in fact, the security of the entire
    IOTA network—depends on network effects. If there are only a few devices on the
    network, then a rogue actor in charge of one machine would sooner or later get
    assigned by the random process to validate one of his or her own past transactions,
    creating an opportunity to approve a double-spending or otherwise fraudulent transaction.
    On the other hand, as the network becomes much bigger, the chances of that happening
    become exponentially less likely, providing strong assurances of integrity. IOTA
    says it gets stronger and more scalable the bigger it gets—the opposite of Bitcoin.

    in its IOTA token, which became one of the best performing tokens on the market.
    But things became rocky after cryptographers at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative
    discovered easily exploited flaws in the algorithm IOTA created to generate transaction
    hashes. Rather than use a standardized hashing tool like the SHA-256 algorithm
    used by Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, the IOTA team had opted for a
    customized version, and it turned out to be seriously flawed. The revelation prompted
    a sharp drop in the value of IOTA’s token and required every user to upgrade to
    a new version of its software or be locked out of the IOTA economy—a hard fork,
    in other words. After the MIT group reported on its findings and cited the case
    as an example of why better security audits are needed, IOTA’s token plunged in
    price. Investors in IOTA—clearly unhappy about the fall in their tokens’ value—went
    into damage control on social media, accusing the MIT team of deliberately spreading
    “FUD” (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) to further their interests and attacking
    the integrity of a Forbes journalist who’d written up the MIT findings. Co-founder
    Sergey Ivancheglo took to an IOTA-linked blog to argue, unconventionally, that
    the flaw in the code had been deliberately inserted as “copy protection,” so that
    anyone who made a copy of the open-source software to compete with IOTA would
    confront problems. This prompted a barrage of criticism from many in the cryptography
    community, for whom there is a long tradition of openly critiquing each other’s

    otherwise it developed and managed its cryptography, the IOTA team’s economic
    model is enticing. If its cryptographic flaws can be fixed, the tangle idea could
    in theory be far less taxing and expensive in terms of computing power than Bitcoin
    and Ethereum’s methods, which require every computer in their massive networks
    of validators to process and confirm the entire list of new transactions in each
    new block. German engineering and electronics giant Bosch has been running a range
    of experiments with IOTA, including one involving payments between self-driving
    trucks arranged in an energy-saving linear “platoon.” The idea is that the trucks
    at the back that are enjoying the benefits of the slipstream would pay IOTA tokens
    to those at the front to compensate them for bearing the bulk of energy costs
    in creating that slipstream. Meanwhile, IOTA and Bosch are both part of a consortium

    mechanism to carry out similar load-management strategies as those used by traditional
    grid managers in much wider energy regions. A floating KwH token represents a
    local price for power, and like all market prices it functions as a signal to
    users within the microgrid. But because it’s a digital signal, people can finely
    tune their devices’ response to it. They can choose to charge their Teslas only
    when power is abundant and cheap, for example, or they can create priority lists
    of different devices, some of which can automatically turn off (for example, the
    TV), while others will be programmed to stay on (the refrigerator). These same
    pricing signals, which will reflect the balance of demand and supply for power,
    can guide the software running the microgrid to divert excess electricity to battery
    storage when it is abundant or tap that same backup when the system is in deficit.
    The question is: who or what is going to manage this internal power market and
    payments system? For reasons we’ve outlined elsewhere—high intermediary fees,
    the inefficiencies of post-trade account reconciliation, and the risk of interference
    by a ledger-keeper, such as a public utility, whose interests misalign with users’—decentralized
    groups such as these really need decentralized trust solutions.'

- en: This is where LO3 Energy ended up when it developed its Transactive Grid in
    Brooklyn, a prototype of interconnected households and businesses that share locally
    generated solar power. The community was motivated by a desire to give environmentally
    conscious consumers and users the capacity to know they are buying clean, locally
    generated power as opposed to just helping pay their utility buy renewable credits
    that fund green energy production elsewhere in the United States.

    linked together with those of their neighbors in a distribution network, using
    affordable smart meters and storage units, as well as inverters that allow the
    grid’s owners to sell power back to the public grid. The magic sauce, though,
    comes from a private blockchain that regulates the sharing of power among the
    smart meters, whose data is logged into that distributed ledger. And in the summer
    of 2017, LO3 took the process a step further by developing an “exergy token” to
    drive market mechanisms within and among decentralized microgrids such as Brooklyn’s.
    (Exergy is a vital concept for measuring energy efficiency and containing wasteful
    practices; it doesn’t just measure the amount of energy generated but also the
    amount of useful work produced per each given amount of energy produced.)

    one of those cases when this model is likely sufficient, since the community is
    founded on a fixed group of users who will all agree to the terms of use. That
    means that some of the large-scale processing challenges of Bitcoin and Ethereum
    can be avoided and thus that the high transaction power of a blockchain could
    be harnessed without requiring the implementation of the Lightning Network and
    other “off-chain” scaling solutions currently under development. A private blockchain
    can process microtransactions, run smart contracts that allow, say, prepaid electricity
    access to be administered based on whether a user has made a digital currency
    payment or not, and enable efficient peer-to-peer exchanges of energy in return
    for KwH tokens. It’s the blockchain, then, that enables the decentralized marketplace
    and pricing signals that the microgrid needs in order to optimize efficiency.
    It means the system can run without some centralized company or authority deciding
    who gets power and at what price. It also means the grid’s capacity can grow organically
    as each member of the community will add new revenue-earning panels and other
    equipment as it becomes profitable to do so, knowing that the same system will
    incorporate it efficiently.

- en: 'Around the world, small and medium-size enterprises, known as SMEs, have woeful
    access to letters of credit and other trade-finance facilities used to cover the
    period in which an exporter’s goods are being shipped overseas to the buyer. A
    major reason: lending institutions can’t sufficiently trust the documents, such
    as port-issued bills of ladings, that SMEs furnish as collateral for loans. As
    of now, even the slightest amount of suspicion that, say, an exporter in possession
    of a bill of lading has already pledged that shipment to some other lender is
    the kiss of death for a loan application. If evidence of those documents and their
    attached liens can be securely recorded in a blockchain, proving they haven’t
    been duplicated, perhaps SMEs can finally assert their creditworthiness, bringing
    even more competition to global markets. Standard Chartered in Singapore has already
    developed such a proof of concept.'

  zh: 在世界各地，被称为中小企业（SMEs）的企业对于信用证和其他贸易融资工具的获取十分困难，这些工具用于覆盖出口商货物运送至海外买家期间的资金需求。一个主要原因是：借贷机构无法充分信任中小企业提供的抵押品，例如港口签发的提单。到目前为止，即使是对出口商拥有的提单存在最轻微的怀疑，比如已将该货物承诺给其他贷款人，都会导致贷款申请失败。如果这些文件及其附加的留置权可以安全地记录在区块链上，证明它们没有被复制，也许中小企业最终可以证明其信用价值，为全球市场带来更多竞争。新加坡的渣打银行（Standard
    Chartered）已经开发了这样一个概念验证。

    chain to become de facto banks or insurers to their suppliers. Exploiting enhanced,
    blockchain-proven information about suppliers’ inventory, they can fine-tune payment
    terms—shifting from, say, ninety days to thirty days. That would help upstream
    providers unlock capital that’s otherwise tied up in stock. Foxconn, the giant
    China-based electronics manufacturer that services major producers such as Apple,
    is leading the charge in this area. Foxconn rolled out a prototype for the thousands
    of suppliers in its various value chains, and not long after the company said
    that the prototype’s use had generated $6.5 million in loans for them.

- en: A more radical way to extract value from blockchain solutions in supply chains
    would involve the issuance of unique tokens of the kind discussed in the previous
    chapter, special digital assets that represent goods and services moving along
    a supply chain. This has the potential to bring flexibility to business dealings
    in the export-import field and innovate new business processes. Tokenization,
    when combined with GPS data and other information recorded in a blockchain, would
    let the owner of goods in transit transfer rights to any buyer anywhere at any
    time, without the shipment having to be recorded by a port. Companies whose products
    were among the $14 billion worth of cargo trapped at sea when South Korea’s Hanjin
    Shipping Co. declared bankruptcy in 2016 might have welcomed this option. One

- en: Blockchain-proven digital tokens point to what blockchain consultant and entrepreneur
    Pindar Wong calls the “packetization of risk.” This radical idea introduces a
    negotiable structure to different phases of the chain. Intermediate goods that
    would otherwise be encumbered by a pre-established chain of unsettled commitments
    can instead be put out to bid to see if other buyers want to take on the rights
    and obligations associated with them. This would attract alternative sources of
    impromptu demand, which could have a market-clearing effect on resource management.
    Enhanced visibility on business processes, when coupled with the ability to find
    liquid markets for goods-linked digital assets, means that industrial actors could
    be incentivized, like never before, to be both environmentally responsible and
    profitable. It’s similar to the principle, explored above, of using price signals
    to optimize a solar microgrid. If tokens allow us to set prices for goods and
    services for which there was previously no alternative source of demand, producers
    might be able to make much better resource decisions. This is why many people
    believe that the concept of a “circular economy”—where there is as much recycling
    as possible of the energy sources and materials in production—will hinge on the
    transparency and information flows that blockchain systems allow.

- en: The principal challenge remains scaling. Open-to-all, permissionless blockchains
    such as Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s simply aren’t ready for the prime time of global
    trade. If all of the world’s supply chains were to pass their transactions through
    a permissionless blockchain, there would need to be a gargantuan increase in scalability,
    either off-chain or on-chain. Solutions may come from innovations such as the
    Lightning Network, discussed in chapter three, but they are far from ready at
    this stage. Instead, companies are looking at permissioned blockchains, which
    we’ll discuss in more detail in chapter six. That makes sense because many big
    manufacturers think of their supply chains as static concepts, with defined members
    who have been certified to supply this or that component to a finished product.
    But in the rapidly changing world of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this might
    not be the most competitive option. Emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing,
    where production can be called up anywhere and delivered by anyone with access
    to the right software files and a sufficiently configured 3D printer, are pointing
    to a much more fluid, dynamic supply-chain world, where suppliers come and go
    more easily. In that environment, a permissionless system would seem necessary.
    Once scaling challenges are resolved, and with robust encryption and reliable
    monitoring systems for proving the quality of suppliers’ work, permissionless
    blockchain-based supply chains could end up being a big leveler of the playing
    field for global manufacturing.

  zh: 主要挑战仍然是扩展性。像比特币和以太坊这样的开放、无需许可的区块链，简单地不适合全球贸易的黄金时代。如果世界所有的供应链都通过无需许可的区块链进行交易，就需要在链下或链上进行巨大的扩展。解决方案可能来自创新，比如第三章讨论的闪电网络，但在这个阶段它们离就绪还很远。相反，公司正在考虑许可的区块链，我们将在第六章更详细地讨论。这是有道理的，因为许多大型制造商认为他们的供应链是静态概念，拥有经过认证的成员，这些成员已被证明可以向成品提供这样或那样的部件。但在第四次工业革命迅速变化的世界中，这可能不是最具竞争力的选择。诸如增材制造之类的新兴技术，其中生产可以在任何地方呼叫，并由拥有正确软件文件和足够配置的3D打印机访问的任何人交付，都指向一个更加流动、动态的供应链世界，供应商更容易进出。在那种环境中，一个无需许可的系统似乎是必要的。一旦扩展性挑战得到解决，并且有了强大的加密和可靠的监控系统来证明供应商工作的质量，基于无需许可的区块链的供应链最终可能成为全球制造业的一个重要平衡者。

- en: Developing blockchain applications for supply chains that improve commercial

    it seeks to cover. The group, which includes firms like KPMG and HSBC and has
    engaged shipping and logistics firms like Hong Kong behemoth Li & Fung, takes
    its name from a massive Chinese global investment program. Beijing’s Belt and
    Road Initiative—also known as the “One Belt, One Road” project—contains a plan
    to invest $3 trillion in collaboratively developing high-tech manufacturing within
    sixty-five different countries along three separate trade routes tying Asia to
    Europe and Africa. Some have described it as a Beijing-led Marshall Plan, but
    as McKinsey partner Kevin Sneader notes, the ambitious program is twelve times
    the size of General George C. Marshall’s 1948 project to reconstruct Europe with
    American investment. The way Pindar Wong, founder of the Belt and Road Blockchain
    Consortium, sees it, “such a complex set of supply relationships across 65 different
    jurisdictions with varying degrees of trust will need a distributed information-sharing
    paradigm if it is to work.” Hence the opportunity for blockchain technologies
    to function as an international governance system. Hong Kong’s role will be important:
    the territory’s British legal traditions and reputation for respecting property
    rights have made it a respected safehouse for managing intellectual property and
    other contractual obligations within international trade. If the blockchain is
    to be inserted into global trade flows, the region’s bridging function may offer
    the fastest and most impactful route. For Hong Kong residents who want the territory
    to retain its British legal traditions, that role could be a vital protection
    against Beijing undermining them.'
