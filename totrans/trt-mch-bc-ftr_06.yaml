    were produced in the years after World War II. Even twenty years ago, undergraduate
    students were able to make single semiconductor chips that had as much raw computing
    power as those room-sized computers. Today, everyday gadgets contain minuscule
    microprocessors with thousands of multitudes more power than the gargantuan, room-sized
    early computers. Information processing is no longer confined to single computers,
    and computation increasingly happens at the interconnection of computers. This
    is why the Internet of Things matters: it’s not that we’ve empowered billions
    of new devices to do computation per se; it’s that they are being connected with
    each other to create a computing colossus that’s infinitely larger than the sum
    of its parts. We’ve reached the point of truth for Sun Microsystems veteran John
    Gage’s famous quip that “the network is the computer.” As we discover ever more
    ways to harness the power of these systems, the processing capacity of that “everywhere
    computer” just keeps building upon itself with every new device plugged into the
    network. This is no small moment for society. Whether this power will be leveraged
    for the good of the people, or to their detriment, has yet to be determined. A

    In a widely read paper titled “Device Democracy: Saving the Future of the Internet

    how to ensure trust. Who is capable of and can be trusted to run a global network
    of billions of devices that will tap into virtually every single thing we do on
    a daily basis? It’s one thing for a private company like, say, Comcast, to offer
    a relatively simple service such as cable for millions of people. But trusting
    a monopoly gatekeeper with all the sensitive personal data that’s broadcast by
    your devices is much more problematic. If you are already uncomfortable with what
    Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple know about you, think about it in the context
    of a centralized IoT. Having transactions pass through a small number of behemoth
    companies would not only be an inefficient way to route data and require regulatory
    constraints to the system, but it could also create an Orwellian level of control.
    Do we really want Amazon Web Services or any other big cloud service provider
    controlling all that valuable data? Not only would that company gain an unprecedented,
    privileged window onto the entire world of material things and human activity,
    but it would, in effect, put those centrally controlled companies in charge of

    system to verify the integrity of the transaction, which may involve a lot more
    information than just that of the money transfer before it can be processed—for
    example, you may need to know whether the overtaking car is certified as safe
    to drive at the faster speed, or whether one car’s software can be trusted not
    to infect the other with malware. These kinds of verifications, as well as that
    of the fund balance in the paying car’s wallet, could be run through a blockchain
    log to check the validity of each side’s claims, giving each the assurances they

    system, each transacting device is also a validating node—unlike the contemporary
    Bitcoin dichotomy, which distinguishes users from miners. The way IOTA works is
    that in order for one device to make a transaction with another one—to send it
    money in the form of IOTA tokens or other forms of valuable information—it must
    itself confirm the validity of two randomly assigned transactions from elsewhere
    in the network. Two transactions out of millions is obviously a significantly
    lesser computing load than is faced by miners in Bitcoin and Ethereum, who must
    process all of those within a given block. It’s on this basis that IOTA makes
    its claim to scalability. But its success—and, in fact, the security of the entire
    IOTA network—depends on network effects. If there are only a few devices on the
    network, then a rogue actor in charge of one machine would sooner or later get
    assigned by the random process to validate one of his or her own past transactions,
    creating an opportunity to approve a double-spending or otherwise fraudulent transaction.
    On the other hand, as the network becomes much bigger, the chances of that happening
    become exponentially less likely, providing strong assurances of integrity. IOTA

    customized version, and it turned out to be seriously flawed. The revelation prompted
    a sharp drop in the value of IOTA’s token and required every user to upgrade to
    a new version of its software or be locked out of the IOTA economy—a hard fork,
    in other words. After the MIT group reported on its findings and cited the case
    as an example of why better security audits are needed, IOTA’s token plunged in

    into damage control on social media, accusing the MIT team of deliberately spreading
    “FUD” (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) to further their interests and attacking
    the integrity of a Forbes journalist who’d written up the MIT findings. Co-founder
    Sergey Ivancheglo took to an IOTA-linked blog to argue, unconventionally, that
    the flaw in the code had been deliberately inserted as “copy protection,” so that
    anyone who made a copy of the open-source software to compete with IOTA would

    bid to build a solar generation plant in Abu Dhabi. That’s about half of the typical
    cost in the United States, a difference that, importantly, makes solar competitive
    with fossil fuels. And while the plant in Abu Dhabi was itself a centralized solution,

    can take charge of their own energy sources—by perhaps building microgrids that
    share the generation capacity of panels on each person’s home—they can eliminate
    a significant amount of power loss due to long-distance transmission, which can
    be as high as 30 percent in some cases. Decentralized microgrids are less vulnerable
    to cyberattacks because it’s so much more costly for hackers to go after multiple
    distributed centers of activity than it is to just try to take out a single server
    in a region’s centralized grid. Decentralized grids also create redundancies—or
    backups—to limit the impact of natural disasters. (Check out nighttime photos
    of Manhattan after the Sandy superstorm, when most of the downtown area below
    34th Street is blacked out because of damage to the centralized grid, except for
    a pocket of light around Washington Square Park, where New York University and
    surrounding buildings were part of a common decentralized microgrid.) Meanwhile,
    although it’s hard to stamp out all forms of corruption, small, localized deals
    aren’t the same magnets for crooked political operatives and shady bankers that
    giant power plant projects have long been in the developing world. And without
    the thirty-year bond deals backed by international investment banks and political

    it would be in conflict with the interests of the overall community, which wants

    mechanism to carry out similar load-management strategies as those used by traditional
    grid managers in much wider energy regions. A floating KwH token represents a
    local price for power, and like all market prices it functions as a signal to
    users within the microgrid. But because it’s a digital signal, people can finely
    tune their devices’ response to it. They can choose to charge their Teslas only
    when power is abundant and cheap, for example, or they can create priority lists
    of different devices, some of which can automatically turn off (for example, the
    TV), while others will be programmed to stay on (the refrigerator). These same
    pricing signals, which will reflect the balance of demand and supply for power,
    can guide the software running the microgrid to divert excess electricity to battery
    storage when it is abundant or tap that same backup when the system is in deficit.

    can be avoided and thus that the high transaction power of a blockchain could
    be harnessed without requiring the implementation of the Lightning Network and
    other “off-chain” scaling solutions currently under development. A private blockchain

    access to be administered based on whether a user has made a digital currency
    payment or not, and enable efficient peer-to-peer exchanges of energy in return
    for KwH tokens. It’s the blockchain, then, that enables the decentralized marketplace
    and pricing signals that the microgrid needs in order to optimize efficiency.
    It means the system can run without some centralized company or authority deciding
    who gets power and at what price. It also means the grid’s capacity can grow organically

    as possible of the energy sources and materials in production—will hinge on the
    transparency and information flows that blockchain systems allow.

    such as Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s simply aren’t ready for the prime time of global
    trade. If all of the world’s supply chains were to pass their transactions through
    a permissionless blockchain, there would need to be a gargantuan increase in scalability,
    either off-chain or on-chain. Solutions may come from innovations such as the
    Lightning Network, discussed in chapter three, but they are far from ready at
    this stage. Instead, companies are looking at permissioned blockchains, which
    we’ll discuss in more detail in chapter six. That makes sense because many big
    manufacturers think of their supply chains as static concepts, with defined members
    who have been certified to supply this or that component to a finished product.
    But in the rapidly changing world of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this might
    not be the most competitive option. Emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing,
    where production can be called up anywhere and delivered by anyone with access
    to the right software files and a sufficiently configured 3D printer, are pointing
    to a much more fluid, dynamic supply-chain world, where suppliers come and go
    more easily. In that environment, a permissionless system would seem necessary.
    Once scaling challenges are resolved, and with robust encryption and reliable
    monitoring systems for proving the quality of suppliers’ work, permissionless
    blockchain-based supply chains could end up being a big leveler of the playing
    field for global manufacturing.

    law, and commercial codes governs rights of ownership and possession along the
    world’s shipping routes and their multiple jurisdictions. It will be difficult
    to marry that old-world body of law, and the human-led institutions that manage
    it, with the digital, dematerialized, automated, and de-nationalized nature of
    blockchains and smart contracts. What standards will port officials use to confirm
    that an importer has taken ownership of goods delivered by a shipper when a blockchain’s
    notion of ownership depends not on possession of physical things but on control
    over a private cryptographic key associated with a digital record of those goods?

    opportunities for all, increase small businesses’ access to finance, reduce waste,
    and give consumers more insight into where the products they buy come from will
    also require some level of standardization. Competition is good, of course, but
    standards allow a wider array of users to connect with technology, creating network
    effects. It has been the same for all technologies, be it measurement models such
    as the metric system or railroad track gauges. The Internet couldn’t grow as it
    did until a large enough group began using the core protocols for transmitting
    data, sending e-mail, sharing files, and securing information. At this stage,
    there is no single, global body seeking to develop such standards, but in various
    industries—in transportation, in the trusted IoT device industry, and in food—various
    alliances and consortia are emerging to explore common technologies.

    difficult. But here, too, the Internet’s precedent is useful. In Hong Kong, a
    diverse group of companies and other stakeholders called the Belt and Road Blockchain
    Consortium has been developing an Internet governance approach pioneered and tested
    by ICANN, the private sector–led body that administers and adjudicates the Internet’s
    global system of domain names and other unique identifiers. California-based ICANN,
    which stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is one
    of a number of important pillars of how the Internet is governed. Its authority
    over the assignment and management of domain names—the Internet’s all-important
    URL real estate—is not bound by the rules of any one government but rather by
    multiple stakeholders with diverse interests that are designed to protect the
    public-good qualities of the Internet.

    it seeks to cover. The group, which includes firms like KPMG and HSBC and has
    engaged shipping and logistics firms like Hong Kong behemoth Li & Fung, takes
    its name from a massive Chinese global investment program. Beijing’s Belt and
    Road Initiative—also known as the “One Belt, One Road” project—contains a plan
    to invest $3 trillion in collaboratively developing high-tech manufacturing within
    sixty-five different countries along three separate trade routes tying Asia to
    Europe and Africa. Some have described it as a Beijing-led Marshall Plan, but
    as McKinsey partner Kevin Sneader notes, the ambitious program is twelve times
    the size of General George C. Marshall’s 1948 project to reconstruct Europe with
    American investment. The way Pindar Wong, founder of the Belt and Road Blockchain
    Consortium, sees it, “such a complex set of supply relationships across 65 different
    jurisdictions with varying degrees of trust will need a distributed information-sharing
    paradigm if it is to work.” Hence the opportunity for blockchain technologies
    to function as an international governance system. Hong Kong’s role will be important:
    the territory’s British legal traditions and reputation for respecting property
    rights have made it a respected safehouse for managing intellectual property and
    other contractual obligations within international trade. If the blockchain is
    to be inserted into global trade flows, the region’s bridging function may offer
    the fastest and most impactful route. For Hong Kong residents who want the territory
    to retain its British legal traditions, that role could be a vital protection
    against Beijing undermining them.'

    high-tech devices and dynamic supply chains, are both a big opportunity and a
    major threat for the kinds of companies that have dominated commerce since the
    previous century. Those companies cannot afford to lie still. But can they afford
    to embrace Bitcoin’s sweeping, disruptive model for managing economic relationships?
    In the next chapter we’ll survey the different ways in which both financial and
    non-financial enterprises are exploring blockchain technology and are trying to
    discover their place in the decentralized economy of the future.
