    central authority. Where previous generations of digital technology have been
    about data and information and how to exchange it faster and more securely, blockchain

    provision of smart contracts which if used properly can become a great way to
    transact and release payment. These are preprogrammed contracts set on certain
    conditions. These conditions determine how an articular transaction unfolds. Smart

    long-term IoT solution to support device design of the future on a massive scale.
    Moving data and backend services away from centralized servers will be the key
    to IoT capabilities reaching their full potential in a secure way. In [Figure

    nobody needs to trust anybody else in order for the system to function—through
    nodes that can operate without a centralized authority. A distributed model is
    more efficient, secure, affordable, and will unlock even unforeseen residual benefits
    for IoT that have yet to be predicted.

    worth of counterfeit goods are sold annually. That’s 2.5 percent of global trade.
    In other words, 1 out of 40 items on the global marketplace is a fake. If you’re
    heading a company, one of your responsibilities is to make sure that none of those
    fake items ends up as a part in your products or, even worse, in the market with
    your company’s name on it. Prevention typically requires big spending on duplicative
    testing, manual auditing, reconciliation, legal fees, insurance, and more.

    longer and keep more spare parts on hand than technically necessary, as well as

    where physician networks and hospitals need to confirm each new clinician’s credentials:
    educational history, licenses, regulatory history, and more. That typically takes
    months, during which the clinician can’t work, and requires contacting more than
    a dozen entities. Health care payers spend more than $2 billion a year maintaining

    farm. A manufacturer that has implemented automated trust creates a digital “birth
    certificate” with specifications, provenance, cost, and other relevant data. It
    then enters this birth certificate (usually an IoT tag) into its existing ERP
    system, integrated with blockchain to create a secure, immutable, cryptographically
    sealed record. This record is instantly available, in identical form, on the different
    servers of the participants in this supply chain, such as the manufacturer, logistics
    providers, distributors, and wholesalers.

    and other measures to provide continuous end-to-end provenance. The logistics
    provider scans the sensors to connect them to the blockchain and to the digital
    birth certificate. As assets change location and condition, IoT sensors gather
    the data. Blockchain stores it, securely and immutably, with a timestamp on the
    servers of all of the participants.

    takes place on the blockchain, which once again creates an immutable, decentralized
    record. Smart contracts—digitally signed agreements that software executes and

    accepts delivery, for example, a smart contract can check the IoT-derived data
    to make sure that temperature and vibrations during transport were within the
    permitted range. If problems occurred, the smart contract consults the record
    to assign responsibility. Another smart contract can automatically calculate (and
    in some blockchains, even issue) the payment due.

    Utilities, for example, may need to confirm hundreds of contractors in a hurry
    when they hire extra crews to respond to a natural disaster. If a technician without
    the right credentials so much as touches a pipe, the company typically has to

    a single contractor, possibly adding unneeded delays and cost to repairs.

    tool, also on the blockchain.
