- en: There is a growing realization all over the world, but particularly in developing
    countries, that there is a set of problems linked to trust, verification and value
    transfer that could actually be solved with blockchain technology, unlocking untold
    potential for advancement.

- en: This is the starting point for *Chain Reaction.* In this sense it is very much
    an emerging markets book, which is why I found it so interesting. Yet, in taking
    the reader on a journey—often in some of the world’s most challenging regions—to
    where one of the most transformative technologies is being applied, it is also
    incredibly helpful for anyone who truly wants to understand why people are so
    excited by what is often described as little more than an accounting tool or fancy
    spreadsheet.

    works, how other blockchains overlap and differ from Bitcoin, and how entrepreneurs
    in developing countries are adopting this technology in an attempt to solve a
    multitude of problems from money transfer to counterfeit prescription drugs, holding
    warlords to account and testing for coronavirus. Case studies from Uganda to the
    Philippines and Mongolia*,* along with useful developed world examples, serve
    to emphasize the massive impact the concepts so far proven by Bitcoin could have
    on the developing world.

    and for Bitcoin in particular, such as gaining acceptability in entrenched industries,
    issues around data integrity and the resistance of governments who fear loss of
    power and control with blockchain adoption. Blockchain is not the panacea that
    cures all ills.

    wallets and payment systems, as exemplified by M-Pesa in Kenya and WeChat in China.
    Most interestingly, they show how the frontier markets of Africa, despite lower
    per capita wealth—or perhaps because of this—are among the most innovative in
    the world and are successfully “leapfrogging” into latest technologies.

- en: The chapter on trust is especially insightful, looking at the problems created
    in property records as a significant example. The authors explain how risk can
    be mitigated through a blockchain’s ability to simplify verification and leverage
    transparency to develop trust, if managed effectively. Another chapter shows an
    aid organization using blockchain to distribute vouchers that can be used as electronic
    cash, with the advantage of being able to accurately and efficiently trace each
    user and their transactions.

- en: 'The authors take care to explain blockchain in a way that is both accessible
    to the novice but with sufficient depth to comprehend the considerable issues
    that the technology is grappling with. The book also acknowledges that even the
    language used to describe these emerging technologies is in flux, as the authors
    explain what is (and is not) meant by “decentralized”, “trustless” and other adjectives
    often thrown around to describe blockchain-based systems. Hint: these words don’t
    mean what you think they mean.'

- en: 'One innovative idea coherently explained is the possibility of private permissioned
    blockchains, with a “proof of stake” validation and consensus mechanism, where
    validators deposit money and use it as collateral to vouch for a block in the
    blockchain, providing a useful half-way house between fully decentralized public
    chains and centralized legacy systems. In probing how blockchains operate and
    who controls them, we get to know the various actors: the users, node operators,
    miners and developers—the people who maintain and create the protocols on which
    these systems run.'

    where bull market ideologues face off against gold-bugs and sceptics who decry
    crypto as worthless, in favor of a more considered exploration of cryptocurrencies
    vis-à-vis their competition, ranking their qualities in comparison to physical
    and electronic cash. Crypto comes out poorly, for now, as an accepted means of
    exchange, but beats physical cash for storage and, crucially for emerging markets,
    immunity to the hyper-inflation, capital controls and banking sector risks that
    plague many fiat currencies. This leads us to the book’s central thesis: if the
    potential of blockchain technology is to be fulfilled, developing markets are
    likely to be the biggest beneficiaries.'

    can impact the developing world but is also a primer for understanding distributed
    leger technology, blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
