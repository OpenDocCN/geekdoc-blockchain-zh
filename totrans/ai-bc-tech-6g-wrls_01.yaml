    applications require a massive resource, enormously high data rates, and increased
    throughput of 1 Tbps. To accomplish these requirements, existing 5G network may
    not be proficient. 5G will likely not have the ability to fully meet the needs
    of new applications based on self-driven vehicles, drone technologies, virtual
    reality (V.R.), augmented reality (A.R.), mixed reality (M.R.), and extended reality
    (E.R.). 6G networks will be the data superhighway and make the intelligent cyber-physical
    world fully connected. The 6G technologies are surprisingly helpful for integrating
    people, devices, vehicles, sensors, information, cloud resources, and robot specialists.
    6G network enables great data rate, ultra-low latency, high bandwidth speeds,
    high quality of services, energy efficiency, and intelligent spectrum utilization.
    This chapter focuses on the evolution of 1G-6G and technological advancement that
    enabled a paradigm shift from 5G to 6G. Performance metrics of 6G is compared
    with 5G, and key features of 6G are also highlighted in the proposed chapter.
    Terahertz communication, MIMO, and fast full-inclusion access will bring about
    the densification of the 6G network. Further, the chapter also introduces 6G applications
    with emerging technologies.

    The 5G systems can cope with basic IoE and ultra-reliable low latency communications,
    but emerging technologies of IoE that demand end-to-end co-design of communication,
    control, and computing localization and Akyildiz sensors remain a challenging
    area that might not fulfil. AI, Blockchain, and IoE-based applications need a
    tremendous amount of resources, extremely fast data rates, ultra-low latency,
    and throughput of 1 Tbps. Moreover, there is a need for the best connected heterogeneous
    network environment [[2](#CR2)] to serve the heterogeneous application requirements

    of IoE applications came into existence. The 5G system could not capture sensory
    inputs of Extended Reality (X.R.) because they could not deliver low latency for
    high-capacity data rates. The emergence of drones, underwater communications,
    and autonomous cars is a field where 5G could not meet the rate-reliability-latency
    ratio. The cryptographical techniques used with 5G may not be able to secure the
    IoE devices. Past systems used cellular base stations, but smart cities now require
    electromagnetic surfaces such as roads and buildings to cater to wireless networks.

    It had issues, for example, low-range use, restricted help types, and slow information

    arises around 2030\. 6G requires a bigger transmission capacity to help high information
    rates and ultrafast communication. These particulars lead to the foster Terahertz
    range framework, which comprises the recurrence band of 0.1 to 10THz [[36](#CR36)–[38](#CR38)].
    All in all, Terahertz (THz) is a recurrence range in the far-infrared range, i.e.,
    at the interface of hardware and photonics. The lower limit is directly over the
    microwave zone, which is utilized by satellite dishes and cell phones, and as
    far as possible is close to the infrared frequencies utilized in T.V. controllers
    and other devices. As an outcome, the THz hole consolidates microwave and infrared
    electromagnetic range. This locale of the electromagnetic range is wealthy in
    detecting, imaging, and correspondences prospects, just as one of a kind uses
    in evaluating for weapons, explosives, and biohazards, just as water content and
    human skin.

    devices, and specialized gadgets. It has a potential for very high information

    [42](#CR42)]. Because of less free space diffraction of the waves, terahertz communication
    is more directional than microwave or millimeter links [[43](#CR43)]. It can uphold
    ultrahigh transfer speed spread range networks, which can empower secure communication
    enormous limit system, and insurance against channel jamming attacks. There is
    a lower weakening of THz radiation contrasted with I.R. under certain climatic
    conditions, e.g., haze. THz can empower solid communication where IR-based networks

    particles in the climate, like water fume and oxygen, assimilate or disperse the
    THz recurrence band. Since way loss is very high for 6G, it forces a genuine constraint
    on communication reach and inclusion region which is up to 10 m. So essential
    necessity is to cultivate radio antennas which resound in THz locale and supports
    high data transfer capacity just as exceptionally mandate. Graphene sheet-based
    antenna is one of the fields which required further exploration. Channel and commotion
