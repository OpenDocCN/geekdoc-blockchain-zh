    technology (DLT) in its wider context has been around since the beginning of time.
    That may or may not be the case. The importance of the paper is that it was written
    anonymously in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis and as an alternative
    to the current financial system (which was – and is still – fundamentally broken).

- en: Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
    payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
    financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the
    main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
    We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
    The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based
    proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
    The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed,
    but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority
    of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network,
    they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires
    minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can
    leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain
    as proof of what happened while they were gone.[¹](#c08-note-0001)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions
    serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system
    works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses
    of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really
    possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost
    of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction
    size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there
    is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible
    services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants
    must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they
    would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.
    These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical
    currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel
    without a trusted party. What is needed is an electronic payment system based
    on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact
    directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions
    that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud,
    and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In
    this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer
    distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological
    order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively
    control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.

    work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial
    transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer
    of assets. Cryptocurrency is a kind of digital currency, virtual currency or alternative
    currency. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized
    electronic money and central banking systems. The decentralized control of each
    cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain,
