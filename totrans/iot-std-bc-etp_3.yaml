    is currently revolutionizing the way enterprises will do business in the future.
    Though the technology is still in the experimental stage, there are a lot of benefits
    which many enterprises are already achieving in part from the technology. Discussing
    the basics, Blockchain was developed as a technology to exchange money by some
    young mathematicians, and now this has come to the center stage where almost every
    business transaction can be executed securely and cost-effectively. Blockchains
    promise to bring collaboration between companies, enabling the sharing of both
    factual data and business logic across an ecosystem in a standardized, structured,
    and secure manner.

    history of transactions. Cryptography  is associated with the process of converting
    ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice versa. It is a method of
    storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom
    it is intended can read and process it.

- en: Blockchain is not centralized, which is the most interesting part – what this
    means is that it is not owned by one party or person. It is democratized, which
    is the important thing, and because of this it increases trust between parties
    because no single entity owns the blockchain. It increases accountability (since
    every authorized party is part of the decision-making process) and above all transparency
    (since every authorized party can see each and every transaction). With such transparency
    and accountability, the technology enables a much lower friction.

- en: You can consider blockchain as a book. A book has many pages, and all pages
    are glued with a binder. The book is owned by one person or in some cases owned
    by multiple people. Each page has multiple entries or transactions – such as person
    A holds X value, person B has Y value – and each of these transactions is used
    to compute a unique value, which is called a unique identifier, for the page.
    So this means that if any value in the page changes, the unique identifier will
    also change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In blockchain language, a book is called a ledger, pages are called the blocks,
    and the binder is the chain of a blockchain. If the book is owned and managed
    by one person, it is called a centralized ledger management, and if the book is
    owned and managed by multiple people, it is called a distributed ledger management.
    The unique identifier is called the hash. If anything in the block changes, the
    hash value changes since the hash is generated using each entry in the block.
    One of the important features of a blockchain is immutability, which means that
    any transaction once recorded cannot be altered. If someone tries to tamper or
    change the content of an existing block, the changes will reflect only in their
    copy, and the rest will still continue to see the untampered version of the block,
    which means the blockchain is immutable. This makes a blockchain tamper-proof
    and highly secure. Now adding a new block to a blockchain is similar to adding
    a new page to the book. This is what blockchain is all about.

    participants have equal rights. Everyone can see the ledger as well, thus maintaining
    transparency at all times. However, public blockchains do come with their fair
    share of flaws as well. In reality, these platforms are slower than usual; they
    are less secure and many times violate data privacy laws. Furthermore, it can
    attract malicious people using the platform for illegal activities because of
    the anonymous nature.

    instead of a centralized ledger. In a centralized ledger, one person or entity

    are responsible for the ledger.

    either the network starter or by a set of rules put in place by the network starter.
    Businesses that set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned
    network. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network
    and who can perform which transaction. Participants need to obtain an invitation
    or permission to join. The access control mechanism could vary – existing participants
    could decide future entrants, or a regulatory authority could issue licenses for
    participation, or a consortium could make the decisions instead. Once an entity
    has joined the network, it will play a role in maintaining the blockchain in a
    decentralized manner.

    blockchain which is designed specifically for enterprises to do business using
    a blockchain. It is an environment in which every one of the parties who agreed
    to be part of the consortium in the permission chain gets visibility to all of
    the data that they have permission, which gives them the ability to see every
    allowed transaction that is registered on the blockchain. As an example, a retailer
    will be able to see where their products are; even though it is delivered by a
    third-party logistic company, they can find the location, condition of their shipments
    or products, and so on. Since the chain is not controlled by one person, there
    would be no disagreements, and no one can tamper the data – there is just one
    state of truth which is distributed and transparent across every member, and every
    member has the same priority and accountability as others on the data and transactions.
    And whatever has been entered once becomes permanent, which means there is no
    debate or question on the accuracy of the data.

    states. This company produced a very small volume of peanut paste in the United
    States, tune to just 2%. Peanut paste is an ingredient that is used in a lot of
    products. Because a lot of products use this butter, during the outbreak almost
    every product which uses this ingredient was deemed contaminated. The chain reaction
    was that anything that had granulated peanut from any supplier got recalled, and
    the products ranged from crackers, chocolate bars and cookies, ice creams, and
    even pet food products. There were a total of 3913 different food products that
    had to be recalled, and this was just because a small manufacturer that produced
    2% of peanut butter shipped salmonella-tainted peanut butter. The CEO of the company
    Stewart Parnell was awarded several years of imprisonment for doing that. Some
    of these recalls that happened took as long as two months after the initial outbreak
    was detected. Can you imagine for two months contaminated products sitting on

    get transported by air, land, or sea, and in many cases, they are transported
    cross country where they are cleared by customs, and then mangoes are brought

    collect health metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and more
    from patients who are not physically present in a healthcare facility, eliminating
    the need for patients to travel to the hospitals. Data is then forwarded to healthcare
    professionals and/or patients for the next steps. These are devices such as Fitbit
    and Apple Watch that an individual can wear all the time, and these devices are

    arriving data from devices (as an example with wearable devices), since most of
    these devices use a Gateway for Internet connection, for example, smartphones.
    These devices collect data for hours or even days sometimes, and once an Internet
    connectivity is established, data is then sent to the back-end systems. So, the
    first challenge in such a scenario is that systems should be able to handle the
    burst of data, and second is that the systems should be able to make sense of
    the data and associate it with the right time period.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    send data, and therefore each device manufacturer has defined their own standards.
    So, if a device is collecting data offline, some may send the most recent data
    first, and some may send old data first. This means that the IoMT solutions should
    address this challenge. This makes pattern 1 highly inefficient since device software
    needs to be rewritten to embed such standards. Patterns 25 and 35 are most relevant
    in this scenario.

    way in which devices choose to resend data during anticipated failures is different
    for different devices since there is no standard defined. Some devices choose
    to resend complete data again because they were in the middle of transmitting
    data when a connection was lost, or they did not get an acknowledgment that a
    particular piece of data was successfully received. Irrespective of the reasons,
    since each device operates differently without a standard mechanism, it becomes
    a challenge when a multitude of different devices come together. Patterns 25 and

    medical industry, if enterprises try to create solutions at the device level using
    pattern 1, it is obvious that managing and maintaining these devices not only
    brings in a lot of OPEX costs but there will be massive CAPEX costs. CAPEX costs
    will be toward making the devices adapt to a standard way of operations, and this
    may mean rewriting or upgrading software on these devices. OPEX costs will be
    for patches and upgrades. Cost is one part, but there are other challenges, such
    as devices using different communication protocols to talk to the external world,
    which will need a solution. All these challenges make pattern 1 inappropriate
    in an IoMT context. By using pattern 35, devices can be left as it is, and an
    IoT Gateway will address these challenges at the Gateway level. There are several
    commercial-grade IoT Gateways that have already addressed these challenges, and
    therefore pattern 35 is considered the most appropriate in large-scale IoMT use
    cases.

    Although the term mechanization is often used to refer to the simple replacement
    of human labor by machines, automation generally implies the [integration](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integration)

    is the act of harmonizing business processes with current, automation-based technology
    to make the entire breadth of cross-enterprise workflows convenient, optimized,
    and less erroneous. In other words, it shifts tasks from being siloed, department
    specific, and manually done to being streamlined, universally accessible, and
    strategically automated. It does this by introducing new software to the current
    systems. This software acts as an extension of those already in place, performing
    many of the repetitive and monotonous functions that would have previously fallen
    on multiple employees across multiple departments. Such was the main cause of
    business process lag times and chokepoints as parts of that workflow stalled between
    departmental queues. However, with digital transformation technologies in place,
    employees need to spend less doing things “the old way.” Bolstered by automated
    technology and streamlined, cross-department software, enterprises can now divert
    attention onto higher-level, high-order work, resulting in a fine-tuned enterprise
    workflow process that minimizes waste and maximizes resource productivity.

    for automating a repetitive task for which a subject matter expert (SME) is required
    who understands how the work is done manually. In addition, the data sources and
    destinations need to be highly structured and unchanging – robotic process automation
    tools cannot apply intelligence to deal with errors or exceptions at all. But
    even with these considerations, there are tangible, concrete benefits from robotic
    process automation. Studies by the London School of Economics suggest RPA can
    deliver a potential return on investment of between 30% and 200% – and that is
    just in the first year.^([1](#Fn1)) Savings on this scale will prove hard to resist.

    benefits are too compelling for companies to ignore. Robotic process automation
    (RPA), for example, can capture and interpret the actions of existing business
    process applications, such as claims processing or customer support. Once the
    “robot software” understands these tasks, it can take over running them, and it
    does so far more quickly, accurately, and tirelessly than any human. Complementing
    RPA with AI algorithms can provide additional benefit that the robot can learn
    from data and from its mistakes so that it can improve its accuracy and performance

    activities, and since the last few years, RPA has been highly successful for several
    use cases. Even if we consider some of the world’s largest problems solved by
    organizations like NASA, it had been achieved with traditional rules or theories.
    As an example, for flying from Earth to Mars, NASA does not aim for where Mars
    is currently, it aims to find out where Mars will be nine months later, since
    it takes nine months for astronauts to travel from Earth to Mars. The rule which
    NASA applies to predict the location of Mars after nine months is based on the
    300-year-old Newton’s law of motion. Newton’s theory works for all planets in
    our solar system, except Mercury. Mercury is another story anyways because it
    is too close to the sun, etc., and other reasons. A similar case is with the stock
    market. A predefined rule such as “buy stocks if the short-term average of the
    stock cuts over the long-term average of the stock” works quite well. Such predefined
    rules used to be the norm in the last few years when AI was not part of the enterprise
    strategy, which is not the case anymore. AI is becoming mainstream for most organizations,
    and there are more and more use cases that are proving the benefits of AI. Because
    of this renowned focus, enterprises have started moving away thinking about traditional
    rules and rule-based systems. The new norm is – give me data and I will create
    models by learning from the data, and the more I learn, the better the models
    I will create. This is what Artificial Intelligence is all about. For IoT use

    be taken right after devices generate the data. As an example, if a device records
    very high temperature in a furnace, the furnace needs to be immediately switched
    off, and this temperature data is useful only if actions are taken at that point
    in time. Enterprises need to understand the IoT solutions provided by IoT product
    vendors for real-time processing and analysis.

- en: Artificial Intelligence is highly dependent on quality data to make right predictions.
    Once enterprises have the enough quality data, the way AI works is that a machine
    learning model is given a set of data. With this first set of data, the model
    performs computations and predicts an outcome. If the outcome is wrong, it readjusts
    the rule and applies the rule on the second set of data and predicts the outcome.
    This cycle goes on until the outcome is correct. Once the outcome is correct,
    data is fed multiple times again to determine the accuracy of the outcome. After
    applying the rule on thousands of data sets and consuming loads and loads of data,
    a model that does the right predictions is created. This is what machine learning
    is all about.

    lead into several challenges. Several times, Applied IoT can become a tedious
    and lengthy project if not planned well. There are four key lessons that I have
    personally learned in Applied IoT use cases, which are depicted in Figure [10-2](#Fig2).![../images/517610_1_En_10_Chapter/517610_1_En_10_Fig2_HTML.jpg](../images/517610_1_En_10_Chapter/517610_1_En_10_Fig2_HTML.jpg)

    2000 plus retail stores in the United States wanted us to create an Artificial
    Intelligence utility using machine learning that is able to alert the store manager
    in less than five seconds if any celebrity turns up at their store. The store
    manager then will be able to greet the celebrity and give them a warm welcome
    to the store. We developed the Applied AI use case and deployed it at  five stores
    in Alaska using 400 cameras, and it gave us encouraging results with more than
    95% success rate. We implemented the POC using a facial recognition technique
    and machine learning patterns for around 5000 celebrities using millions of data
    sets. It worked great at Alaska.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We used the same technique in Michigan and other cities with 10,000 cameras,
    and the results were not encouraging. We missed 32% of the celebrities that entered
    the stores in both Michigan and Detroit since the data used was not sufficient
    to recognize all the celebrities around the region. This case study taught us
    that if a proof of concept proves that it works within five seconds with 400 cameras
    and 5000 celebrities, it does not mean it can work for 40,000 cameras and across
    50,000 celebrities. So the first lesson learned is that a POC is not successful
    unless it is proven that it can scale.

- en: To predict and provide accurate results, AI models require a lot of data and
    time. A medium to complex Applied AI use case needs at least six to nine months
    of learning time to provide 95% accuracy. A manufacturing customer called Seagate
    asked us to deploy several devices across their entire production line with the
    requirements to receive real-time insights on their product line failures, because
    traditionally if one of their units fails, the whole production line stops, which
    can cause several hundred of dollar losses. But the key ask from the customer
    was that we cannot tell them of these failures too early or too late; they needed
    to be informed just before any incident will occur. To achieve such near-real-time
    failure alerts, we needed to have an enormous amount of data, and the model needed
    several months of learning to predict the failures. After feeding millions of
    IoT data sets to the machine learning model for more than nine months, the model
    was able to predict failure just about 85% of the time.

- en: We were called to a hospital where there were high incidences of tuberculosis
    (TB) in a city. It was decided by the government to perform a TB test on each
    and every person from the city above 40 years of age. Though there were scans
    being performed on a mass scale across the city, the challenge hospitals faced
    is that after a chest X-ray is taken, it took two weeks for doctors to come back
    and confirm if a person is positive or negative to TB. For positive cases, in
    the two-week timeframe the risk was that the infected person would transmit the
    disease to others around them. AI was applied to solve this problem. We asked
    doctors to share all X-rays of patients and categorized them into two buckets,
    namely, TB positive and TB negative. TB positive are patients who were infected
    with TB, and the rest were categorized as TB negative. Machine learning models
    were run on thousands of X-rays which were pulled from the labs across the city.
    Models were trained over and over based on the positive and negative reports.
    After learning from millions of X-rays, finally the AI model was able to predict
    from an X-ray if a person is TB positive or negative in just one second. A 95%
    success rate was achieved by the algorithm.

- en: So the key learning from this case study is that enterprises need to be very
    specific on what they want to achieve (predict) from AI. In the hospital case
    study, we used only X-rays as the means to predict tuberculosis in patients –
    we did not use MRI or CT scan.

    in a proximity of 100 kilometers to my location how many food stores are there
    which has food items that will expire in the next two days. Using this data, stores
    provide discounts between 50% and 70% on the expiring food items. I found around
    2000 food items within the 7-kilometer radius from my hotel, and once I clicked
    a specific store, it gave me a list of all expiring items in that store. I was
    also able to click a specific item, and the app gave me a list of all nearby stores
    where the expiring item was available. This is a simple app which did not require
    AI to perform the job, and a few simple rules were sufficient. The company that
    developed this app started with an aspiration to develop the app using AI algorithms,
    but soon they realized that the app does not need AI, and a few simple rules would
    be sufficient to extract the expiry date information from the food items and share
    it with users. This means that once you spend enough time collecting data and
    you see results, it is best to implement the rule instead of forcing yourself
    to do Applied AI.

- en: The lesson learned with this example is that enterprises do not always need
    to force the data collected to do AI, even though they have been funded to do
    AI. If you can already do good with the data you have using predefined rules,
    please use the rules to achieve the business outcome.
