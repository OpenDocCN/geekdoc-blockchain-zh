    is currently revolutionizing the way enterprises will do business in the future.
    Though the technology is still in the experimental stage, there are a lot of benefits
    which many enterprises are already achieving in part from the technology. Discussing
    the basics, Blockchain was developed as a technology to exchange money by some
    young mathematicians, and now this has come to the center stage where almost every
    business transaction can be executed securely and cost-effectively. Blockchains
    promise to bring collaboration between companies, enabling the sharing of both
    factual data and business logic across an ecosystem in a standardized, structured,

- en: You can consider blockchain as a book. A book has many pages, and all pages
    are glued with a binder. The book is owned by one person or in some cases owned
    by multiple people. Each page has multiple entries or transactions – such as person
    A holds X value, person B has Y value – and each of these transactions is used
    to compute a unique value, which is called a unique identifier, for the page.
    So this means that if any value in the page changes, the unique identifier will
    also change.

  zh: 你可以将区块链看作一本书。一本书有许多页，所有页都用一个粘合剂粘在一起。这本书由一个人或在某些情况下由多个人拥有。每页有多个条目或交易 - 例如人A持有X价值，人B持有Y价值
    - 每个交易都用于计算一个唯一值，称为页的唯一标识符。因此，这意味着如果页中的任何值发生变化，唯一标识符也将发生变化。
- en: In blockchain language, a book is called a ledger, pages are called the blocks,
    and the binder is the chain of a blockchain. If the book is owned and managed
    by one person, it is called a centralized ledger management, and if the book is
    owned and managed by multiple people, it is called a distributed ledger management.
    The unique identifier is called the hash. If anything in the block changes, the
    hash value changes since the hash is generated using each entry in the block.
    One of the important features of a blockchain is immutability, which means that
    any transaction once recorded cannot be altered. If someone tries to tamper or
    change the content of an existing block, the changes will reflect only in their
    copy, and the rest will still continue to see the untampered version of the block,
    which means the blockchain is immutable. This makes a blockchain tamper-proof
    and highly secure. Now adding a new block to a blockchain is similar to adding
    a new page to the book. This is what blockchain is all about.

    the data that they have permission, which gives them the ability to see every
    allowed transaction that is registered on the blockchain. As an example, a retailer

    third-party logistic company, they can find the location, condition of their shipments

    would be no disagreements, and no one can tamper the data – there is just one
    state of truth which is distributed and transparent across every member, and every
    member has the same priority and accountability as others on the data and transactions.

    way in which devices choose to resend data during anticipated failures is different
    for different devices since there is no standard defined. Some devices choose
    to resend complete data again because they were in the middle of transmitting
    data when a connection was lost, or they did not get an acknowledgment that a
    particular piece of data was successfully received. Irrespective of the reasons,
    since each device operates differently without a standard mechanism, it becomes
    a challenge when a multitude of different devices come together. Patterns 25 and

    will be toward making the devices adapt to a standard way of operations, and this
    may mean rewriting or upgrading software on these devices. OPEX costs will be
    for patches and upgrades. Cost is one part, but there are other challenges, such
    as devices using different communication protocols to talk to the external world,
    which will need a solution. All these challenges make pattern 1 inappropriate

    systems. This software acts as an extension of those already in place, performing
    many of the repetitive and monotonous functions that would have previously fallen
    on multiple employees across multiple departments. Such was the main cause of
    business process lag times and chokepoints as parts of that workflow stalled between

    have, the more business insights they can generate. Using data science, enterprises
    uncover patterns in data that they did not even know existed. For example, one
    can discover that they are at risk of an accident based on the data which another
    car in front of them sends. Data science is being used extensively in such scenarios.
    Enterprises are using data science to build recommendation engines, predict machine
    behavior, and much more. All of this is only possible when enterprises have enough
    amount of data so that various algorithms could be applied on that data to give
    more accurate results. Data science is all about applying Artificial Intelligence
    using machine learning algorithms on huge data sets to make predictions and also
    to discover patterns in the data.

    activities, and since the last few years, RPA has been highly successful for several
    use cases. Even if we consider some of the world’s largest problems solved by
    organizations like NASA, it had been achieved with traditional rules or theories.
    As an example, for flying from Earth to Mars, NASA does not aim for where Mars
    is currently, it aims to find out where Mars will be nine months later, since
    it takes nine months for astronauts to travel from Earth to Mars. The rule which
    NASA applies to predict the location of Mars after nine months is based on the
    300-year-old Newton’s law of motion. Newton’s theory works for all planets in
    our solar system, except Mercury. Mercury is another story anyways because it
    is too close to the sun, etc., and other reasons. A similar case is with the stock
    market. A predefined rule such as “buy stocks if the short-term average of the
    stock cuts over the long-term average of the stock” works quite well. Such predefined
    rules used to be the norm in the last few years when AI was not part of the enterprise
    strategy, which is not the case anymore. AI is becoming mainstream for most organizations,
    and there are more and more use cases that are proving the benefits of AI. Because
    of this renowned focus, enterprises have started moving away thinking about traditional
    rules and rule-based systems. The new norm is – give me data and I will create
    models by learning from the data, and the more I learn, the better the models
    I will create. This is what Artificial Intelligence is all about. For IoT use

    This cycle goes on until the outcome is correct. Once the outcome is correct,
    data is fed multiple times again to determine the accuracy of the outcome. After

    being performed on a mass scale across the city, the challenge hospitals faced
    is that after a chest X-ray is taken, it took two weeks for doctors to come back
    and confirm if a person is positive or negative to TB. For positive cases, in
    the two-week timeframe the risk was that the infected person would transmit the
    disease to others around them. AI was applied to solve this problem. We asked
    doctors to share all X-rays of patients and categorized them into two buckets,
    namely, TB positive and TB negative. TB positive are patients who were infected
    with TB, and the rest were categorized as TB negative. Machine learning models
    were run on thousands of X-rays which were pulled from the labs across the city.
    Models were trained over and over based on the positive and negative reports.
    After learning from millions of X-rays, finally the AI model was able to predict

    be sufficient to extract the expiry date information from the food items and share
    it with users. This means that once you spend enough time collecting data and
    you see results, it is best to implement the rule instead of forcing yourself
    to do Applied AI.

  zh: 我们当时在哥本哈根，我看到了一个移动应用。该移动应用显示了距离我的位置100公里范围内有多少食品店的食品将在接下来的两天内过期。利用这些数据，商店会在即将过期的食品上提供50%至70%的折扣。我在距离我酒店7公里的半径范围内发现了大约2000种食品，一旦我点击了特定商店，它就会给我列出该商店所有即将过期的物品。我还能够点击特定的物品，然后该应用程序会给我列出所有附近商店有该即将过期物品的列表。这是一个简单的应用程序，不需要AI来执行任务，只需几个简单的规则就足够了。开发该应用程序的公司最初的愿望是利用AI算法开发该应用程序，但很快他们意识到该应用程序不需要AI，几个简单的规则就足以从食品中提取到期日期信息并与用户共享。这意味着一旦你花足够的时间收集数据并看到结果，最好实施规则而不是强迫自己使用应用AI。
- en: The lesson learned with this example is that enterprises do not always need
    to force the data collected to do AI, even though they have been funded to do
    AI. If you can already do good with the data you have using predefined rules,
    please use the rules to achieve the business outcome.

  zh: 通过这个例子学到的教训是，企业并不总是需要强迫使用收集到的数据来进行AI，即使他们已经获得了AI的资金支持。如果你已经可以使用预定义的规则对你拥有的数据进行良好处理，请使用这些规则来实现业务结果。

- en: The importance of big data in Artificial Intelligence is clearly articulated
    in this chapter. Data science helps AIs figure out solutions to problems by linking
    similar data for future use. Fundamentally, data science allows AIs to find appropriate
    and meaningful information from those huge pools of data faster and more efficiently.
    It goes without saying that enterprises can be successful in applying Artificial
    Intelligence for IoT use cases only if they have quality data and are able to
    use the data in the right way.
