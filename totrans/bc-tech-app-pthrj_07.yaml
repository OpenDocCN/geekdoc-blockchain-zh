- en: Artificial intelligence and blockchain are the two most promising technologies
    that have evolved in the last few years. In a very short span of time they have
    permeated into almost every possible industry. AI enables machines to make decisions
    like human beings and can handle complex problems, whereas blockchain provides
    a distributed data environment and offers data transparency, security and privacy.
    Although these technologies look quite different from each other, there are prospects
    to combine them. This amalgamation would take the strengths of both AI and blockchain,
    so that the resulting technology would be robust and more efficient than either
    of them individually. These two technologies complement each other and can therefore
    reduce the weaknesses of each other. Since AI requires huge amounts of data for
    making predictions, these datasets can be stored on a distributed platform provided
    by blockchain. Blockchain could be benefited by the use of AI to create autonomous
    organizations or to monetize user-controlled data. Both AI and blockchain are
    in their nascent stage and are going to evolve individually. In this chapter,
    we’ll see how these two technologies interact and what the future prospects for
    their merger are.

    manifestation is realized in the last few decades. Although a common man may not
    realize it, artificial intelligence (AI) is already embedded into our life. While
    searching for keywords on the Internet, on our way to work, purchasing online
    or while chatting with friends, we are most likely using AI in the background.
    The airline industry has been using AI for decades now, to regulate air traffic
    and for efficient landing and take-off schedules. Boeing planes involve human
    steering mostly at the time of landing and take-off, whereas for the rest of the
    flight, autopilot takes command. Google Maps uses location data from smartphones
    and analyzes the traffic patterns for that location in real time. By using feedback
    data of visitors and user-reported cases like breakdown, construction, accidents,
    etc., Maps can provide more accurate information and route suggestions. These
    suggestions significantly reduce the commuting time by informing the user about
    the fastest route between two locations. Various cab booking apps like Ola, Uber,
    etc., use AI to determine the cost of the ride, best route and for booking nearby
    cabs on request with minimum arrival time. Their ride-sharing feature optimally
    books the passengers to minimize detours. They use AI to determine surge pricing,
    estimated time of arrival (ETAs), meal delivery time and also for fraud detection.
    [Figure 8.1](chapter8.xhtml#fig8.1) shows a few popular applications of AI.

    and Pinterest. Facebook has an AI-based feature called tagging that can identify
    faces in any uploaded image and can suggest names for them. It is based on a face
    recognition algorithm of machine learning (ML). ML is a branch of AI that develops
    algorithms which can learn from data and can predict outcomes for unknown data.
    For a common man, it is not easy to understand how Facebook is able to recognize
    his family members and friends. For tagging, Facebook uses an ML algorithm built
    upon artificial neural networks (ANN) that mimics the human brain to recognize
    human faces. In 2016, Facebook introduced DeepText [[1](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00001)]
    which is a text-understanding engine that can understand the textual content of
    thousands of posts, from multiple languages (around 20), with accuracy close to
    human understanding. DeepText helps to identify and mark the content that is most
    relevant. For example, a property broker is most interested in posts related to
    sale and purchase. So, DeepText can identify such posts and displays the most
    relevant content. Similarly, DeepText helps popular public figures to automatically
    identify the most relevant text from the comments on their posts. Facebook acquired
    Instagram which uses machine learning to suggest emojis. Recently, emojis have
    replaced text and are used to show sentiments. The ML algorithm also tries to
    understand user sentiments, by studying the type of emojis used by users at a
    given point of time. Instagram has made emojis very popular not only among the
    young generation, but for almost every user of any age. It has totally changed
    the way people communicate with each other. Only a decade before, no one would
    have imagined that simple emoji graphics would be used to show the sentiments
    of a distant person. There is another popular social media app called Pinterest
    that has a huge image and video database. Pinterest uses computer vision and pattern
    recognition techniques of ML to automate the process of object identification
    in images and videos. Pinterest also recommends similar pins to the users. The
    visual search feature of Pinterest is based on image matching and retrieves the
    best matches for any given image. Snapchat is very popular these days due to its
    feature called Lenses. These are filters that can track facial movements and can
    add animated effects to the images. Snapchat presents a variety of filters and
    keeps updating them on a regular basis. These filters use ML algorithms to learn
    the movements of faces in real-time videos.

    based on a fixed set of words, but it continuously learns from the messages, related
    metadata and user responses. Google uses an AI approach to mark emails as important
    based on the sender’s data or message content and categorizes emails under primary,
    forum, social, promotion and update inboxes. Gmail also learns if a user marks
    an email as spam or important. Recently, many banks have started to provide the
    facility to deposit cheques through a smartphone app. Banks rely on companies
    like Mitek [[2](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00002)] that use identity verification and mobile
    capture technology, built on artificial intelligence algorithms, to decipher and
    convert handwriting on cheques. Banks also use AI to find fraudulent transactions,
    by creating systems which can learn from fraud transaction data. Atiya [[3](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00003)]
    proposed neural network algorithms to determine the credit worthiness of a loan
    applicant, based on historical data. The decision is based on a number of factors
    like the credit history of the applicant, frequency of transactions, kind of business,
    etc. The algorithm not only approves or disapproves the loan application, but
    it also determines the interest rate, time period and credit limit. Hence, AI
    improves the risk assessment for the banks and provides efficient decisions. This
    would further help in reducing the losses faced by banks due to fraudulent transactions
    and delinquent customers. Machine learning is also used to prevent frauds in online
    credit or debit card transactions [[4](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00004)]. Financial service
    providers like MasterCard suffer more losses due to false declines than fraud
    [[5](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00005)]. So, MasterCard has employed AI algorithms to learn
    the purchasing habits of cardholders in order to minimize false declines and to
    maximize the probability of identifying a fraudulent transaction.

    last few years. These portals use efficient search engines to return the most
    relevant products to the user based on keywords. They also maintain the history
    of each buyer and recommend products based on their previous purchases. These
    portals also manage the demographic data of the customers, so that they can recommend
    products which were ordered by other customers with similar demographic data [[6](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00006)].
    Amazon uses ANN to generate recommendations for its customers.

    text. About a decade ago, it was beyond imagination to accurately convert voice
    to text by the most advanced systems of that time. But ML has made it possible
    today, even for hand-held devices like smartphones, tablets, etc. Recently, Hinton
    et al. [[7](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00007)] proposed the use of artificial neural networks
    for speech recognition. Dahl et al. [[8](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00008)] proposed context-dependent
    pre-trained deep neural networks for large-vocabulary speech recognition. We start
    our day by saying “OK Google, open Maps”, to find the best route from home to
    office. As soon as we start speaking, the ML algorithm instantly converts it into
    text and takes action. To connect a call, we only say “OK Google, call Mom” and
    it behaves like an obedient assistant. For Google’s voice search, ANNs are used.
    At times, these speech recognition systems can transcribe more accurately than
    human beings. So, spoken instructions to smart personal assistants have now become
    the new interface. Siri [[9](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00009)] by Apple and Google Now
    are two personal assistants that can set reminders, call contacts from the phonebook,
    perform searches and manage appointments. Amazon took speech recognition one step
    further, by introducing complementary hardware called Alexa [[10](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00010)].
    Alexa is a personal assistant that recognizes voice commands to carry out a number
    of tasks. It is powered by AI algorithms. Alexa can answer questions asked in
    natural language, set reminders, order food, play music and perform a number of
    other activities.

    amounts of data. A lot of research is being done recently to improve the response
    time of algorithms. The need to efficiently handle big data is the real motivation
    behind the merger of blockchain with AI. Data analytics involve the processing
    of enormous data and drawing correlations between patterns in the dataset. Blockchain
    is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that stores data securely and transparently
    [[11](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00011), [12](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00012), ]. In contrast to
    the centralized systems of operations which have been mostly used to date, blockchain
    is based on a decentralized system. Through the use of decentralized database
    architecture, the procurement, authentication and maintenance of various operations
    are dependent upon the agreement of several parties instead of a single central
    authority. Blockchain not only makes operations transparent, but safer and faster
    also. Blockchain became popular with the emergence of cryptocurrency Bitcoin [[13](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00013)],
    where transactions are managed using a distributed ledger on a peer-to-peer network
    that has anonymous, open and public access [[14](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00014)]. Blockchain
    is the underlying technology which maintains the Bitcoin transaction ledger. The
    blockchain transactions are stored in the public ledger and are verified by the
    consensus of a majority of participants in the system [[15](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00015)].
    The information can never be erased in a blockchain as it maintains a verifiable
    record of every transaction. The digital currency Bitcoin itself is highly controversial,
    but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found a wide
    range of applications in both the financial and non-financial worlds. [Figure
    8.2](chapter8.xhtml#fig8.2) shows these two distinct technologies. Recently Salah
    et al. summarized upcoming blockchain applications and protocols while targeting
    artificial intelligence [[16](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00016)]. Dinh and Thal [[17](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00017)]
    compared the features of blockchain and AI. They suggested that the integration
    of these two technologies would revolutionize the new digital generation. Chen
    et al. recently proposed an AI convolution neural network-based nodes selection
    in blockchain networks [[18](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00018)].

    that permits wide read access of blockchain data to the applications. It employs
    service-oriented architecture (SOA) [[20](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00020)] and consists
    of three parts: Services, clients and middleware. Here, services take care of
    the business logic of blockchain applications and are intended to implement logically
    complete and minimum functionality for solving a particular business task. Clients
    originate most transactions and read requests in a blockchain. Middleware is responsible
    for managing transactions, interoperating services among clients, access control,
    generating responses for client’s read requests, etc. Exonum has the advantage
    that it is easier for clients and auditors to audit the system in real time. Due
    to the adoption of SOA, the application could easily reuse, add or configure the
    services developed for other Exonum applications. Exonum provides a significantly
    higher throughput capacity (order of 1,000 transactions per second) as compared
    to permission-less blockchain, and can encode complex transaction logic. Exonum
    uses pessimistic security assumptions for validator node operation. The consensus
    algorithm employed in Exonum does not introduce single points of failure. Furthermore,
    the set of validator nodes is reconfigurable, allowing it to scale the security
    by adding new validators, rotating keys for validators, locking out compromised
    validators, etc. [Figure 8.3](chapter8.xhtml#fig8.3) shows Exonum service design
    where each service and auditing instance has a local replica of blockchain storage
    to ensure authenticity of the data and balancing the load.'

    system. AI depends on very large, complete datasets with high configuration hardware
    to train the algorithms. The greater the size of the data, the better the performance
    of the AL/ML algorithm. Companies with huge data and enriched AI technology have
    more resources to improve and experiment with AI algorithms. This gives us a view
    that AI requires the centralization of data. It requires complete and consolidated
    data at one location for better computing results. In contrast, blockchain believes
    in the decentralization of data and its control. At the same time, the data and
    other resources are available to every user connected to the network. The decentralization
    of data in a blockchain involves execution cost due to network latency, and in
    order to reduce it, steps must be taken to speed up the data access. Blockchain
    guarantees that users have complete ownership of their data and computing power,
    which can be rented to other users on request. Various agencies and companies
    working with AI models could take advantage of the data present on the blockchain.
    They might not own the data, but can access them legally due to decentralized
    distribution. The computing resources can also be decentralized. Thus blockchain
    could manage the requirements of AI, allowing authorized users to develop and
    run AI algorithms on huge datasets provide by multiple users.

    transparent. Blockchain is based on the principle of transparency. All the authorized
    users can view the ledger in a public blockchain. Even the anonymous data are
    available on the ledger. All the transactions are transparent and visible to other
    users also. Blockchain has another important principle, trust, which exists due
    to the use of cryptography. On the other hand, AI and ML algorithms are very difficult
    to understand. Most of the machine-learning algorithms require knowledge of advanced
    mathematical topics like optimization, linear algebra, etc., and are often considered
    a black box by most of their users. It is believed that in future blockchain could
    help in better understanding of AI-ML algorithms. Blockchain can provide public
    access to the data by which the AI models are trained and can analyze the potential
    weakness in the model. Since the performance of any AI model is based on the quality
    of the data, therefore a public audit of data can improve the correctness of data.
    This would further enhance the performance of the AI algorithm.

    decision making. The AI algorithms require extensive data for training and efficient
    decision making. Here, blockchain could play a significant role by storing and
    managing the data securely. Unlike traditional centralized database systems, blockchain
    creates a decentralized-distributed network of databases. This essentially means
    that the data are stored on a large network, where information is verified by
    multiple parties, and once data are entered, they cannot be erased from the blockchain.
    Any illegal mutation in data will be noticed by other computers of the blockchain,
    which will rectify the invalid data. Also, the data on the blockchain are secured
    through cryptography, which makes it incredibly difficult to decipher and modify.
    Any tempering with the data on the blockchain can be observed by the users due
    to cryptographic signatures associated with the data available on the network,
    across all the systems. This makes blockchain ideal for storing sensitive information.
    Therefore, blockchain is considered more secure than traditional database systems
    which are more prone to cyber-attacks. It appears that the requirements of AI
    can be supported by blockchain and we can expect a seamless communication between
    the two technologies. A few key characteristics of their interaction are discussed
    here.

    multiple parties since AI relies on large datasets, most of which will be shared.
    The performance of AI algorithms improves with the size of data. So, the availability
    of more data for analysis means better predictions by the algorithms and more
    reliability. The data supplied as input to AI algorithms should be valid. This
    requires a high level of data security, achieved by reducing the probability of
    any catastrophic occurrence. Blockchain also deals with sensitive data and has
    protocols that support data security [[24](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00024)]. The performance
    of AI algorithms could improve with the availability of more real-time data from
    multiple sources. Companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Flipkart, etc., have
    huge amounts of data, increasing every second, as shown in [Figure 8.4](chapter8.xhtml#fig8.4).
    These data could be useful for a number of AI problems, but they are not freely
    accessible to public. This limitation of data accessibility can be resolved by
    blockchain, by the concept of peer-to-peer communication. Since blockchain is
    an open distributed registry, its data are available to every network user. Hence,
    the monopoly of companies over the data would be relaxed and other users could
    gain access to the data.

    principle of computer systems. There are malicious users who intentionally modify

    to the alteration of results also. Data may get corrupted unintentionally in instances
    like incorrect data captured by a malfunctioning sensor or a part of critical
    data may be lost due to hardware failure. Block can help in creating partitions
    of verified datasets, so that the AI models should use only the verified data.
    This will further identify any fault in the data chain and would lead to its correction.
    This would also help in reducing the efforts required in troubleshooting and locating
    the erroneous data in the segments. The data once captured through a transaction
    in a blockchain becomes immutable i.e. any intentional or unintentional alteration
    in the data will be reported by other users of the system. This makes the data

    and artificial intelligence provides better control over the data as well as the
    models. If a user creates data for his AI model, he can specify restrictions or
    permissions in the license for data. Licensing of data can be easily done in a
    blockchain. The permissions to read or access the data can be easily set in a
    blockchain. SingularityNET [[27](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00027)] is an open-source AI
    marketplace that collects smart contracts for a decentralized market of coordinated
    AI services. As per the SingularityNET team, blockchain technology provides transactional
    and bookkeeping advantages for managing network transactions. Blockchain allows
    users to add or upgrade an AI service for use by the network and get back network
    payment tokens in exchange. With this platform, the data owners can control the
    use of their data and will be benefited in monetary terms. Thus, blockchain, together
    with smart contracts [[28](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00028)], ensures that the data whether
    generated by financial transactions, applications or customer details, are valid,
    recorded in real time and are immutable. This ensures that correct and accurate
    data are available to be used by AI models and results in faster and secure transactions.

    etc., by providing real-time access to data. But these models suffer due to limited
    access to relevant data. Required data may not be available due to ownership restrictions.
    As a result, AI algorithms may end up working with low-quality data and the results
    may not be accurate. Blockchain could overcome this situation, as it provides
    access to a huge accumulation of data, which might be owned by distinct users
    and is immutable but accessible to all. Various applications designed using AI
    suffer from barriers like lack of authentication, unwanted intermediaries, risk
    of fraud, monopoly ownership on data, inaccuracy, etc. AI together with blockchain
    can reduce the ownership of a single entity, eliminate intermediaries and assure
    that the data is secure, accurate and authenticated by the stakeholders involved.

    availability, the issues can be resolved and algorithms can be improved. AI has
    revolutionized the modern industries, but it suffers due to lack of trust. Blockchain
    can be more reliable in building trust as it maintains a publicly accessible registry
    of the data and AI models, which are immutable and are digitally secured through
    cryptographic signatures [[29](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00029)]. The blockchain users
    are permitted to access the verified information and consensus models in real

    by chaining the way they are managed. For instance, if a blockchain user transfers
    a Bitcoin to a peer on his network, the transaction might take days to get confirmed.
    This happens due to the decentralized nature of blockchain where the Bitcoin miners
    group the transactions into blocks. A sudden increase in volume of such transactions
    could further delay the transaction as the block-size is limited. If any transaction
    requires a block of larger size, it will be kept in queue for confirmation by
    the other miners. AI could reduce the complexity of this situation by improving
    the confirmation time of the transactions. Blockchain uses hashing algorithms
    [[30](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00030)] with a “brute force” approach that tries to find
    every possible combination of characters until the best match is found for the
    verification and confirmation of a transaction. The hashing algorithm could be
    replaced by an AI model which can be trained with correct data for efficient and
    quick confirmation of transactions. AI can improve the data mining process and
    can streamline the operations of a blockchain. This would further reduce the time
    and processing power required in mining the data in a blockchain.

    problem where the size of blockchain is growing at 1 MB every 10 minutes and the
    existing data are around 85 MB. Blockchain has not incorporated any method to
    deal the data optimization and elimination. AI can help blockchain in this regard,
    by introducing a decentralized system for data optimization. The peer-to-peer
    transactions on a blockchain cost millions of dollars. The cost is high as each
    node executes the same task on its copy of data and tries to produce the solution
    before other nodes. AI can reduce the cost involved by predicting the node that
    will be the first one to deliver the solution. It can inform other nodes to shut
    down their operations, so that only the node which is going to give the earliest
    correct solution will complete the execution. This will ultimately reduce the
    cost of operations of the entire blockchain and can improve the efficiency of
    the system. Blockchain is known to maintain data with high security. AI can assimilate
    features like multi-dimensional data representation, image labeling, natural language
    processing, sound recognition, etc., into blockchain. This would allow miners
    to convert a large-scale system into several smaller subsystems that can optimize
    data transactions in a more secure environment.

    speed. Researchers are working on scaling solutions for blockchain to improve

    of training sessions are conducted in order to teach the algorithms to make efficient
    decisions. The training time for ML algorithms is usually very high. If the system
    could provide more computing power to the algorithms then the algorithm could
    be trained in a faster way. So, the researchers and companies are working on the
    idea of boosting the AI technology with numerous GPUs, which are already used
    for mining cryptocurrencies. The GPU networks used for blockchain can also be
    used to provide more power to the ML algorithms. Another advantage of using GPU
    mining networks is that any user can access a distant supercomputer for executing

    in the US might train the algorithms with the data collected from its population.

    Google collect data from their customers without their consent like our search
    history and interaction with Google products like Maps, YouTube, etc. Those free
    data are used by Google to create information and to make money. A blockchain

    of data. It is also important to maintain high standards of data security, due
    to the sensitive nature of the data. Blockchain could possibly reduce the occurrence
    of data breach or theft by involving multiple parties for data decryption, combined
    with the use of asymmetric cryptography. With a blockchain-backed system, the
    data can be easily uploaded by the patient (the owner) and he can give permissions
    in exchange for an agreed-upon price paid to him. But this comes with a challenge
    to devise a network currency that could overcome the problems due to having participants
    from multiple countries. Recently, Mamoshina et al. proposed a cryptocurrency
    called LifePound [[21](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00021)]. The data owner can generate this
    currency by putting his data on the blockchain and can be benefited by the incentive
    scheme. In this blockchain-based healthcare system, the blocks of transactions
    are processed and stored, along with management of keys for cryptography. The
    data are stored in encrypted form in the local storage. There are different categories
    of users. Some users are the owners of data and can upload and sell them in the
    marketplace. Others are consumers who are interested in buying the data. Some
    are data validators, and all these categories use LifePound as cryptocurrency.

    Blockchain maintains hashes which record a timestamp for a transaction and approve
    them. Timestamping is achieved through blockchain anchoring and the transactions
    are approved by digital signing and public key infrastructure. The storage of
    a medical data ecosystem could be an existing cloud storage like AWS that provides
    a platform for building applications [[35](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00035)]. This storage
    is not part of blockchain, but it is required to hold large medical files which
    are in the form of images or videos. To provide authentic access to the data,
    public key infrastructure is required which is established through blockchain.
    To keep the data secure, the data uploaded on the cloud, at the user side, are
    encrypted with a threshold encryption scheme [[36](#re_TNF-CH008_CIT00036)]. The
    data can be kept at the user’s local storage also which would provide actual privacy
    and control to the user over their data. There is a possibility of lending the
    data to customers instead of selling it. The full nodes of blockchain are the
    organizations that have complete access to data in the blockchain. They are of
    three types. Validators commit new blocks with transactions to the blockchain.
    Another type is auditors who audit the marketplace. The third category is the
    key keepers who maintain key shares as per a certain threshold encryption scheme,
    required for decrypting the data.

    blockchain eventually builds a data marketplace where patients could get paid
    for their personal medical data. The data corpus thus accumulated will be used
    by data analysts, organizations for developing prediction models, pharmaceutical
    companies and by researchers. Currently, very few people go for comprehensive
    periodic medical tests that include laboratory tests, MRI, ECG, etc. If these
    data are combined with lifestyle data, demographic data and medical history, they
    would be of great value for researchers. There are number of companies that can
    pay for the data to train their AI algorithms. More data used for the training
    of an AI model means improved accuracy. The funds generated could be used further
