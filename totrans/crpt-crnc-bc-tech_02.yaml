- en: The aim of this chapter is to provide a short overview of cryptocurrency research
    as of the end of 2019\. We do this by means of a scientometric analysis, which
    has been used across a wide-ranging number of disciplines. We do not provide here
    a critical literature review per se. Rather, our ambition is to present the pathway
    through which research has flowed in the past decade. To do so we draw on similar
    pieces of work across other disciplines, such as that of sustainability and sustainability
    development ([Olawumi and Chan](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_036) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_036))),
    the development of building information systems ([Zhao](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_046)
    ([2017](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_046)), [He et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_022)
    ([2017](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_022))), food authentication ([Danezis et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_016)
    ([2016](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_016))), biotic identification ([Ruaro and Gubiani](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_039)
    ([2013](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_039))) and even at the level of products, such
    as algae, biohydrogen and biodiesel ([Konur](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_026) ([2011](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_026),
    [2012a](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_027),[b](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_028))). With
    regards to examples as to how such research can provide benefit to broad disciplines,
    [Rotolo et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_038) ([2015](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_038))
    developed a definition of ‘emerging technologies’ and linked the conceptual effort
    with the development of a framework for the operationalisation of technological
    emergence, which could then be used to trace the development of research over
    time. [Serenko et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_041) ([2010](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_041))
    conducted a meta-analysis of prior scientometric research of the knowledge management
    using 108 scientometric studies of the discipline and subjecting each meta-analysis
    techniques. Further, [Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_013) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_013))
    provides such a review as of early 2019, what we aim for here is to analyse the
    development of this area of research in terms of its intellectual structure. [Lowry
    et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_032) ([2013](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_032)) investigated
    journal quality and the association for information systems, specifically analysing
    as to whether expert journal assessments add value? The authors conclude that
    bibliometric measures provide very similar results to expert-based methods in
    determining a tiered structure of IS journals, thereby suggesting that bibliometrics
    can be a complete, less expensive, and more efficient substitute for expert assessment.

    have taken many regulatory systems by surprise. While research to uncover the
    many systemic repercussions of this digital finance evolution continues to expand
    at pace, much evidence points toward substantially differing characteristics associated
    with these new financial products relative to traditional financial products on
    which much regulation has been honed over time. The development of cryptocurrencies
    and the surrounding research associated at both the narrow-product level (namely,
    Bitcoin or Ethereum individually) or at the broad-level (all cryptocurrencies)
    has been further advertised by the unprecedented price appreciations that have
    taken place across a number of assets, particularly that of Bitcoin. These products
    have therefore offered substantial opportunities to a number of speculative investors,
    not to mention a transmission vehicle through which those with illicit needs can
    take advantage of regulatory circumvention. Research, beginning with such humble
    beginnings through the work of [Nakamoto](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_035) ([2009](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_035))
    has expanded to analyse technical, sociological, legal, financial and economical
    aspects of the product. However, such research has recently begun to question
    if this price evolution could be a symptom of other deeper issues such as the
    presence of financial bubbles ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_014) ([2018a](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_014));
    [Fry](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_018) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_018))), or
    as to whether the product is now unfortunately overcome with illegality. In recent
    works to identify such illicit tactics, [Griffins and Shams](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_020)
    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_020)) investigated Tether’s influence in Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrency prices to find that purchases with Tether were timed
    following market downturns and resulted in significant increases in the price
    of Bitcoin. Further, less than 1% of the hours in which Tether experienced significant
    transactions is associated with 50% of the increase in Bitcoin prices and 64%
    of other top cryptocurrencies, drawing the damning conclusion that Tether was
    used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices. Along with
    this source of instability, cryptocurrency exchanges as well as individual currencies
    have experienced several sophisticated hacking events, further damaging the confidence
    in this asset class. Further, [Gandal et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_019) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_019))
    identified the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt.Gox Bitcoin exchange
    theft, when approximately 600,000 Bitcoins were attained. The authors demonstrated
    that the suspicious trading likely caused the spike in price in late 2013 from
    $150 to $1,000, most likely driven by one single actor. These two significant
    pieces of research have fine-tuned the focus of regulators, policy-makers, and
    academics alike, as the future growth of cryptocurrencies cannot be sustained
    at pace with such significant questions of abnormality remaining unanswered.

    ([2009](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_035)), Bitcoin has developed as an investment
    asset that have no association with any higher authority, specific country, tangible
    asset or firm, and the value of it is based on the security of an algorithm which
    is able to trace all transaction ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_011)
    ([2020](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_011))). [Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_013)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_013)) provided a thorough overview of the empirical
    literature based on the major topics that have been associated with the market
    for cryptocurrencies since their development as a financial asset. Anonymity and
    decentralisation of cryptocurrency attracted attention from both users and investors,
    which caused enormous growth of market capitalisation and price of Bitcoin. [Corbet
    et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_014) ([2018a](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_014))
    while utilising the bubble identification methodology of [Phillips et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_037)
    ([2011](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_037)), found clear evidence of periods in which
    Bitcoin and Ethereum were experiencing bubble phases. [Urquhart](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_043)
    ([2016](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_043)) investigated the efficiency of Bitcoin
    using a battery of robustness tests to find that returns are significantly inefficient
    over their selected full sample, but when dividing the same sample, Bitcoin presented
    evidence of becoming more efficient. Recent findings by [Sensoy](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_040)
    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_040)) also report that Bitcoin prices both in
    terms US dollar and euros have become more efficient. Similar research has been
    conducted on the newly developed Bitcoin futures market ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_012)
    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_012)); [Katsiampa et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_024)

    ([2019b](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_025))). Further research areas have developed
    with focus on trading rules ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_010) ([2019c](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_010)));

    for the data used in this bibliometric analysis using all available between the
    first observation, identified as the work of [Nakamoto](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_035)
    ([2009](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_035)) until that of November 2019\. The research
    is separated between two distinct types, firstly, that relating to a digital currency
    directly, such as Bitcoin for example, and secondly, broad coverage of cryptocurrencies
    as a research topic. [Figure 1](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_001) presents evidence
    of the dramatic growth in research based on this new product during the time analysed.
    We clearly observe that research surrounding individual products account for approximately
    twice that of broad cryptocurrency research. There are 521 separate sources of
    coverage for research by product, however, only 323 sources for that relating
    to the sector. With regards to citations, product-level research focused on 10,773
    other pieces of work, while topic-level research accounted for 3,739 citations,
    however, product-level research has generated 9.22 cites per document while topic-wide
    research generated 6.99\. There is evidence of increased multi-authorship on topic-level
    research, with an average of 2.65 authors per paper, substantially above the average
    of 1.99 for product-level research. To date, 3,742 authors have worked on research
    relating to cryptocurrencies whether narrow or broad.

    by author as ranked by the number of articles and associated fractional citations.
    In terms of both narrow and broad areas of research, we can identify a number
    of authors that are prevalent across both research-types. In [Table 3](#b_9783110660807-003_tab_003)
    we observe the top citations across countries based by both narrow and broad research
    types. In terms of narrow-based research, we observe that the United States have
    produced, to this point, the largest number of research articles, however, in
    terms of quality, measured by the number of citations, the UK possesses a far
    more substantial level of cites per article (12.5) in comparison to the United
    States (7.2). Both Lebanon and Switzerland possess the largest number of cites
    per article, but these estimates are provided with the caveat of quite a low number
    of articles published (13 and 14 respectively). Considering broad-based research,
    China has provided far more research articles. Again, the UK stands out through
    the possession of a considerable number of cites per article, considering the
    substantial number of research papers that have been published. However, both
    Ireland and Lebanon lead the way in terms of citations per article (27.8 and 17.7
    respectively).

    of research output and citations. In terms of both narrow and broad types of research,
    Finance Research Letters has published the largest number of papers and is closely
    followed by Economics Letters, who possess are larger number of citations in both
    categories. Both of these journals are closely followed by Applied Economics Letters
    and IEEE Access. It becomes quickly evident that the letters-format of research
    appears to be most popular amongst cryptocurrency researchers. This is most likely
    due to the fast-moving nature of the research area and the ability to quickly
    disseminate research in a reputable and visible manner. Applied Economics, Future
    Generation Computer Systems and International Review of Financial Analysis are
    journals that would be considered to produce more substantial pieces or work closely
    these short-form research outputs. There also appears to be quite a coherent grouping
    of computer-based research outputs along with both economics and finance-based
    research outputs.

    had produced the most cited paper in terms of narrow-focused cryptocurrency research,
    providing a technical survey of decentralised digital currencies in the IEEE Communications
    Surveys & Tutorials. With regards to broad-based cryptocurrency research, [Li
    et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_031) ([2017](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_031)) produced
    a survey on the security of blockchain systems in the journal Future Generation
    Computer Systems. While much of this research focuses specifically on the technical
    elements of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large, some of the most well known pieces
    of research relating directly to economics and finance research include that of
    [Cheah and Fry](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_006) ([2015](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_006))
    who provided an empirical investigation into the fundamental value of Bitcoin;
    [Bouri et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_005) ([2017](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_005))
    who investigated as to whether Bitcoin was a diversifier through its hedge and
    safe-haven properties; and [Urquhart](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_043) ([2016](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_043))
    who analysed Bitcoin in terms of its efficiency as a product. Research from Economics
    Letters and Finance Research Letters appear to be most pronounced. This is further
    supported in [Table 6](#b_9783110660807-003_tab_006) where we observe the combined
    number of cryptocurrency-based research citations (inclusive of both broad- and
    narrow-based research). In terms of broad citations, Economics Letters is the
    most visible research outlet with 1,269 citations, but this is closely followed
    by both Finance Research Letters and Physica A. Then follows International Review
    of Financial Analysis, PLOS One, Applied Economics, Applied Economic Letters and
    Econometrica. We can clearly observe broad cross-discipline coverage, with research
    spanning economics, finance, physics, communications, technological, sociological
    and econometric-based topics.

- en: Bibliometrics, the analysis of citation and author networks, as well as its
    close relative scientometrics, have had significant traction in areas outside
    finance. In the life sciences, medicine and nursing especially, Cochrane Reviews,
    deep systemic reviews of an area incorporating meta analyses and bibliometrics,
    are seen as the gold standard for evidence. A search for “bibliometrics or scientometrics”
    in Scopus will show that close to a quarter of all papers in this area are in
    Medicine. The next largest lies in Library and Archival science. In the UK the
    2021 Research Evaluation Framework reference documents suggest that bibliometrics
    will be a major and indeed enhanced component in both suggested submission strategies
    and in how the review panels form judgements[¹](#fn_10) More critically, [Jappe
    et al.](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_023) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_023)) provides
    a (Sociologically focused) overview of the influence of bibliometrics and scientometrics
    on research evaluation and funding bodies. [Levine-Clark and Gil](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_030)
    ([2008](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_030)), [Vieira and Gomes](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_044)
    ([2009](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_044)), [Franceschet](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_017)
    ([2010](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_017)) and [Mongeon and Paul-Hus](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_034)
    ([2016](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_034)) – which concludes that each has advantages
    but all should, ideally, be used. Considerable data cleaning would be required
    however to create a blended database of all. In addition, not all meta data are
    present in all three data bases, in particular Google Scholar.[²](#fn_11)

- en: Core bibliometric approaches involve surfacing the linkages between papers or
    articles. Here we use, unless otherwise indicated, the number of articles to weight
    collaboration and linkage. Thus linkages are stronger when say two authors collaborate
    with each other on 10 papers than would be the case where another two authors
    collaborate on 5\. These linkages lend themselves nicely to graphical presentation,
    being in essence network models. Graphic models rely on nodes and edges (See [Kosnik](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_029)
    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_029))) where the nodes here are determined by
    the individual units of analysis (authors, countries etc) and the edges the linkages
    between them. In all cases we apply fractional counting, whereby authorship or
    nationality among other characteristics are scaled to the number of occurrences.
    Therefore an author appearing in a paper with five others has their linkages weighted
    <math altimg="../graphic/b_9783110660807-003_ineq_001.png" alttext=""><mstyle
    displaystyle="false"><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow></mfrac></mstyle></math>.
    Linkages are, unless otherwise noted, based on number of documents. The thicker
    the connecting lines in the networks the higher the weight. The package VOSviewer
    was used for this analysis, supplemented by Gephi[³](#fn_12) and the R package
    Bibliometrix[⁴](#fn_13) ([Aria and Cuccurullo](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_004) ([2017](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_004))).

    paper all data are sourced from Scopus, as this captures the widest range of papers
    with complete reference sets and author/institution metadata in a consistent form.
    From the authors knowledge of the area we are confident that no significant academic
    source of papers was omitted. We chose 1990 as a starting point for the research
    as the further back in any bibliometric database one goes the more scant becomes
    the coverage. This issue is discussed in [Michels and Schmoch](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_033)
    ([2012](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_033)) and in [Harzing and Alakangas](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_021)
    ([2016](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_021)). Finally, all citation measures, unless
    otherwise noted, are inclusive of self citation. [Waltman](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_045)
    ([2016](#b_9783110660807-003_ref_045)), S5.3, contains an extensive discussion
    of self citation and its effects on scientometric measures and analyses. The conclusion
    of this section is that in large scale analyses self citation does not overly
    bias or distort findings. Nor is there any clear finding that for authors, as
    opposed to say countries or institutions, self citation should pose a problem
    for scientometric analysis, overall. We break out our analyses into two categories,
    narrow product based research, examining individual cryptocurrencies, and broader
    area based research looking at the entirety of the research

    which were opinion or reportage from The Economist Newspaper, classified as articles
    by Scopus. All data were downloaded as both CSV and as plaintext, where all information
    was selected. This allows for the analysis of inward and outward citations, of
    abstracts and of a wide variety of other bibliometric areas. The usage of the
    terms “cryptocurrency”, “cryptocurrencies”, “digital currency” and “digital currencies”
    enabled the analysis of broad-based cryptocurrency research. While the search
    of terms relating to “Bitcoin”, “Ethereum” and “Litecoin” enabled a search of
    more narrow-focused product level research.

    more narrowly-based, with the great bulk arriving in the 2018-19 period. This
    is a very new area. A Google trends search of cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies
    will illustrate this, with essentially no searches until early 2017\. This is
    of course not surprising given that the Bitcoin ledger did not open until 2009\.
    However, what is notable is the very significant uptick in research from 2017
    to 2018, matching the rise in the Bitcoin price when the notion of such currencies
    really began to penetrate into the public and apparently the academic conscience.

    approaches involve surfacing the linkages between papers or articles. These linkages
    lend themselves nicely to graphical presentation, being in essence network models.
    In all cases we apply fractional counting, whereby authorship or nationality etc
    is scaled to the number of occurrences. Therefore an author appearing in a paper
    with five others has their linkages weighted <math altimg="../graphic/b_9783110660807-003_ineq_004.png"
    alttext=""><mstyle displaystyle="false"><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>6</mn></mrow></mfrac></mstyle></math>.
    Linkages are, unless otherwise noted, based on number of documents. The thicker
    the connecting lines in the networks the higher the weight, documents generally.
    The package VOSviewer was used for this analysis.

    coauthorship. This allows us to look into who is working with whom. [Figure 2](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_002)
    positions this in terms of national collaboration. We split this into three lobes:
    narrow products in (a), broad areas in (b) and overall in (c) The size of the
    nodes indicates the number of units, documents here, while the thickness of the
    lines indicates the strength of the linkages. Colours and shades represent clusters
    based on linkages and collaboration. Starting at (c) we see four main lobes of
    collaborative research, one each centred on the UK, the US, France and Spain.
    US-based authors collaborate strongly with China, surprising perhaps given the
    restrictions on cryptocurrencies in place in China. The UK grouping is essentially
    Europe, with Germany, Ireland and Russia well represented. Australia is also present
    in this grouping, as is Poland and Ukraine linked via Russia. The French grouping
    includes India and South Africa, while the Spanish group is more diffuse, with
    weaker links and a much more geographically spread nature. The broad product-based
    network is much sparser, with three clusters, including that of the US, UK and
    France. The narrow product based research shows the four clusters, suggesting
    that first, collaboration in this area is “bottom up”, focusing on products and
    specific instances of cryptocurrency, and second that this suggests a gap in exploiting
    broad conceptual areas.Examining individuals collaboration we see a very sparse
    network, regardless of how we cut the focus – there are islands of collaboration
    but these are archipelago in format. Enormous synergies exist in collaboration
    potential. The present authors appear as crucial nodes in a number of networks,
    but these are isolated, suggesting that we should ourselves practice what we preach!'

    research clusters based on both narrow and broad research. There is evidence of
    a number of clusters of authors that are prevalent across both types. This is
    also evident when considering the combination of both types of research, with
    further connections and segregation evident between these clusters and the topics
    on which each focus. [Figure 6](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_004) shows a citation
    network of publishing sources. This is a network composed where we examine how
    often each element (here, journal or periodical) cites another. Again, the larger
    the node the more publications, the stronger the citation strength, the more often
    a source cites another, the thicker the linkage line. Also we again subdivide
    into networks, broad subject areas (b) and narrow product-based research (a).

    main clusters – one is focused on the financial economics of the area, revolving
    around publications in Economics Letters, Finance Research Letters and International
    Review of Financial Analysis, while the other is a more technical cluster, with
    Physica A and computing journals. These are however intermingled. This is clearer
    in the broad area, with a third cluster emergent on law, security and commerce.
    Again there is a divergence between products and broad concerns. What seems evident
    is that collaborative opportunities for research do exist but also there is a
    degree of intellectual silo-ing here. There are very few citation linkages between
    the law/commerce/technical journals and the financial research journals.

    Shown in [Figure 7](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_005) are two networks. The narrow
    based products show a very clear bilobal pattern. There is clear national segregation
    with the network of researchers from France and its satellites not really citing
    strongly the larger group of nations revolving around UK and USA. Why this is
    unclear. The situation regarding broader areas of research is less polarised;
    we see three lobes of more or less equal size and importance, one around China,
    one around the UK and one the USA, all with significant linkages each to the other.
    The inference is that when it comes to the broad architecture of cryptocurrencies
    we see significant international intellectual cross pollination but not when it
    comes to applications.

    published by country. The deeper the shade the more highly cited are these papers,
    normalised by the mean number of citations of all papers. We see that papers from
    France, Lebanon, USA, China and UK are highly cited despite, for example, Lebanon
    not being a major “source” of papers. So on what are authors working? In Figures
    [10](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_007) and [11](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_008) we see
    an analysis which surfaces this. In [figure 10](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_007)
    we see an analysis of abstract words, while in [11](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_008)
    we see keywords. Each article requires authors to provide keywords when they submit
    a paper, usually up to 6\. Shown in [Figure 11](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_008)
    is a keyword cooccurance network. Again, as usual, the nodes of the network are
    the units of analysis, here either regular words in [Figure 10](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_007),
    or keywords in [Figure 11](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_008). The size is the relative
    frequency, the linkage thicknesses the number of times each are represented together.
    Examining first the abstract network, we notice four clear clusters. Three- computers
    (far right), economics (top left) and systems (bottom left) are each quite cohesive
    and also distinct from each other. There is a cluster linking these, but it is
    quite diffuse, which we can label Money. Not surprisingly this is at the centre
    of the entire network,these being cryptocurrencies after all. What is interesting
    is what is missing – there is no evidence here of a sustained research aim at
    cybercriminality, despite the concerns people have adduced since the start of
    the cryptocurrency era. No do we see a coherent cluster on environmental issues,
    nor on legal aspects. Overall the research community appears to be concerned with
    the technical, the financial aspects as well as with the technical aspects of
    designing the structures. This suggests that there exists, as much as we have
    seen earlier in author and country collaboration, great potential for “filling
    in the gaps” in research, through interdisciplinary research.

    [Figure 11](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_008), we see a different picture. Recall
    that the keywords are what the authors themselves believe best represent the material.
    As we have done before we split the analysis three ways: (a) shows products, (b)
    areas and (c) overall. For overall we see five clusters. From the right we see
    a cluster on the information structure of cryptocurrencies, one on security, then
    on the top one on design tolerances, a large cluster on the financial economics
    of cryptocurrencies and finally one that examines the micro-structure and investment
    potential thereof. It is striking that we do not see this reflected in the abstracts
    – it suggests that what authors think, or wish for readers to think, they are
    examining is at variance with what is actually examined.'

- en: '[Figure 13](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_009) provides a similar analysis when
    we combine author keywords with the indexing keywords provided by the publishers,
    which are often the basis for bibliometric software such as Scopus or Web of Science
    to use. A further concept in scientometric analysis is that of bibliometric coupling.
    This refers to the degree of similarity which reference sets share. Think of two
    articles, each with say 20 references; in article A 5 each come from 4 other journals,
    in article B they come from 4 also but only 2 of the 4 are common. This set of
    two articles are coupled together by having common sources. However, if all references
    in each of the articles came from the same set of journals they would be more
    closely coupled. Thus we can construct a network where the linkages are the number
    of times that two journals are cited in common, the nodes are the journals themselves.
    This allows us to look at the extent to which research shares common roots or
    otherwise. Shown in [Figure 15](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_010) through [16](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_011)

    is that there tends to be islands of research with limited spillover. Researchers
    in products – Bitcoin, Ethereum etc – draw references and one can reasonably infer
    inspiration form either CS or financial economics literature but rarely from both.
    In CS the IEEE Access open access journal is dominant, followed bu PLOS One. It
    is interesting to see two open access journals as primary sources. In the larger
    and more diffuse economics and finance research cluster we see Finance Research
    Letters and Physica A as the dominant sources followed closely by Economics Letters.
    A marked preference is clear for shorter more focused papers in this area.

- en: Focusing on broader areas as per [Figure 16](#b_9783110660807-003_fig_011) we
    see four clusters of reference sources. The economics cluster has split into two
    – one centred around Physica A is a more quantitative orientated set, including
    Quantitative Finance and Econometrica, the other still centres on the letters
    journals. A third cluster now emerges, blending economy and technical issues,
    with no clear dominant source. The clusters are closer to each other in addition.
    A takeaway here might be that when it comes to conceptual areas researchers draw,
    as might be expected, from a wider and deeper well of primary sources than is
    the case for products. This is potentially problematic as products are embedded
    within the overall information and economic paradigms of their creation.

    science and the environment. Interestingly, there is also a significant cluster

    with regards to these new digital products were identifiable far in advance of
    their eventual occurrence. In the period 2015 through 2018, we can observe the
    clear expansion of coverage across multiple research disciplines. The largest
    clusters surround that of Physica A and PLOS One, focusing on the technical aspects
    surrounding the underlying characteristics of cryptocurrency, while Finance Research
    Letters and Economics Letters focus on the financial and pricing implications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cryptocurrencies are a novel, and sometimes controversial financial instrument.
    Regardless of whether one believes them to be a passing fad, the future of money
    or somewhere in between, they have emerged as one of the most interesting and
    discussed financial assets of the last decade. We find here that these assets
    have had greatly increased research activity focused on them over the last two
    years. This research however is characterised by being rather fragmented. It is
    fragmented in a significant sense across products and broad areas. While islands
    of research do connect they do so in very limited ways. There are parallel, mostly
    non-overlapping research initiatives drawing inspiration form the technical and
    the economic literature but limited “interdisciplinary” research. It is our hope
    that this handbook goes some way to providing an overview of the areas of research
    and will spark greater cooperation.
