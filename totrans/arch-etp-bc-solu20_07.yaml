    realize there are myriad economic decisions that an organization may consider,
    and those decisions can affect the outcome of a customer meeting significantly.
    From my experience, companies that are conservative in the risks that they take
    tend to view blockchain solutions as a gamble. But if you look at how that company
    would address disaster recovery, for example, where backups and DR testing are
    on a schedule with little disruptions, you can apply the same decision-making
    process to blockchain technologies. In other words, that same company will look
    at the IT-centric numbers around ROI, TCO, and other indicators to determine the
    likelihood of success of implementing a technology. It's the same process when
    implementing a blockchain solution.

    transforming the business model, and presenting new opportunities such as using
    a blockchain for shared cost efficiency. Of course, value from blockchain technologies
    will be defined differently between different companies, and the results will
    vary. Blockchain technologies can also open up new markets, for example, with
    the use of cryptocurrency. It can also reduce some markets or at least reduce
    opportunities for traditional payment services such as PayPal, Western Union,
    or global banking systems. Removing these intermediaries creates opportunities
    for blockchain companies but also removes opportunities from traditional organizations.
    The world is constantly changing, and history is riddled with important companies
    that are totally irrelevant today. Companies must constantly innovate and create
    value or become extinct like Polaroid or Blockbuster, for example.

    want to consider deploying a blockchain-based platform application for several
    reasons. First, connecting to a payment processor provides a different means of
    transacting and making payments, which may very well create new sources of liquidity
    for the enterprise as well as its business partners. Second, utilizing a blockchain
    payment gateway could enable the enterprise to lower the cost per transaction
    (TPC) for ecommerce applications by reducing integration costs and intermediaries,
    essentially reducing overhead and providing greater efficiency. Third, deploying
    a blockchain-based payment gateway may reduce the enterprise risks when deploying
    a blockchain application.

    funding methods. These methods will have some impact on the profitability of the
    company because there are significant tax laws not only in the United States but
    also in other countries. The costing models most commonly used are the capital
    expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expense (OPEX) models.
  prefs: []

    future. CAPEX funding is a procurement exercise where approvals are required from
    executives and from the enterprise's procurement departments. This type of funding

    they are accounted for in an income statement and the tax benefits that may present
    to the company. CAPEX spending from an enterprise perspective is used to acquire
    assets such as a datacenter generator, which would have a useful life beyond the
    specific tax year it was purchased. From a tax perspective, these expenses normally
    won't be fully deducted in the year they're incurred (purchased). (They are capitalized,
    amortized, or depreciated over the asset's lifetime, which in the United States
    could be 7 to 15 years.)
  prefs: []

    (*colo*). A colo is a shared data center facility in which an enterprise can rent
    or lease data center space for its IT equipment. These colocation contracts vary
    widely, but one differentiator is that you can actually access your equipment;
    however, in contrast to a cloud computing platform, you have no access to them
    physically. For example, with ATT, Equinix, and Digital Reality, you can visit
    and access your equipment, but with AWS, GCP, and Azure this would not be the

    sources by breaking purchases into smaller amounts. This is similar to going to
    the grocery store with $120 to buy groceries and breaking up the purchase into
    three transactions and then using three debit cards with small limits.  ### Cost
    Considerations'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of a predictable monthly services cost is the fee for reserving cloud computing
    virtual machines. Other examples are leases, support contracts, labor costs, software
    licensing, taxes, insurance, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to determine ahead of time the number of queries against a database. Blockchains
    that are hosted on-site will of course have much more predictable costs, especially
    if the users as well as the blockchain nodes are local. If you have users who
    are utilizing a blockchain as a service (BaaS) in AWS, then you can expect certain
    costs to be unpredictable. Other examples include network bandwidth, transactions
    fees, utilities, and legal fees.

    serving and the amount of risk that the customer is willing to take during implementation
    and even management. For example, if you have a blockchain deployment that can
    use a predefined blockchain template in AWS, that would cut several costs significantly.

    your blockchain's performance, virtual machine configurations, and blockchain
