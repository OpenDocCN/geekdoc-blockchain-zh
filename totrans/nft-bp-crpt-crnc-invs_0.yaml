    token. NFT are certificates for unique digital objects. You certify that you own
    a specific file. Fungible in itself means that a thing can be replaced by something
    equivalent. For example, it does not matter whether you have 20 dollars in your
    wallet as a single note, four 5-dollar notes or 20 1-dollar notes.'

    objects can exist either physically or digitally. For physical objects, such as
    a painting or car, it is easy to set a value. This is measured by the uniqueness
    of the work of art and how much people are willing to pay for it.

    about a particular file that is both unique and verifiable. The blockchain technology
    is used to verify the authenticity of the files.'

    is homogeneously interchangeable. Examples of this from the real world include
    banknotes or precious metals: one gram of pure gold is worth as much as another
    gram of pure gold. And if you give someone a ten-dollar note, it wouldn''t matter

    the same at first glance, but each ticket contains a different passenger name,
    a different destination and a different seat number. Therefore, there could also
    be serious consequences if you exchange a plane ticket for another. The same is
    true in the digital space with NFTs. Another example would be Internet domains,

- en: The sale of rare weapons or skins is currently prohibited in popular games such
    as World of Warcraft, Fortnite, CS:GO or League of Legends. It is also not possible
    to use items or skins from one game in another game. With NFTs, it would be possible
    to transfer objects and clearly assign property rights. This would solve some
    of the biggest annoyances faced by enthusiastic gamers.

    norm for users in video games - I'm thinking, for example, of the skins, also
    with trademarks, of Fortnite or the fashion brands that sell clothes for virtual
    avatars within games - like Gucci in Tennis Clash.

    Özil, who, together with Boss Logic and Genies, has developed a clothing line
    for virtual avatars:the proceeds from the sale of these assets will be donated
    to BigShoe, a non-profit organisation that supports children living in poverty.

    best be combined with a campaign associated with this world: for some brands,
    this is something very natural, while for others it may be necessary to take a
    less conventional approach to use NFT.'

    a 3D object, or a video) and the type of platform through which the works are
    auctioned depending on audience you want to reach and the message you want to
    convey.

- en: The NFT virtual asset market is large. On platforms like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels
    it is possible to buy plots of virtual land. These plots have unique properties,
    just like real world plots. Within virtual worlds, these plots are already being
    traded for tens of thousands of dollars. In addition, the site Unstoppable Domains
    has tokenized the names of websites. Each name of a website can thus be converted
    into an NFT, which can be traded freely by anyone.

- en: This area of NFTs is still at an early stage, but it is possible to tokenize
    real assets such as works of art or record contracts as NFT. The NFTs are used
    to prove that someone owns a work of art (proportionately) or to settle claims
    from royalties.

    a new generation of NFT-related platforms: marketplaces will increasingly resemble
    art galleries where digital artworks can be exhibited and sold in the same way
    as traditional ones. Art is art, whether digital or physical.'

    digitally and can be bought by people who want to dress up their digital counterpart.

- en: One thing to keep in mind, however, is that NFTs can have a big impact on the
    carbon footprint (the production of cryptocurrency requires a large amount of
    energy, which clearly affects the level of CO2 produced), so it is important that
    brands are aware of this and are informed about how they are acting responsibly.
