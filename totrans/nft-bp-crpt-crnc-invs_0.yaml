    token. NFT are certificates for unique digital objects. You certify that you own
    a specific file. Fungible in itself means that a thing can be replaced by something
    equivalent. For example, it does not matter whether you have 20 dollars in your
    wallet as a single note, four 5-dollar notes or 20 1-dollar notes.'

    objects can exist either physically or digitally. For physical objects, such as
    a painting or car, it is easy to set a value. This is measured by the uniqueness
    of the work of art and how much people are willing to pay for it.

    and usage rights, every image, song and video can be copied and redistributed
    at the click of a mouse. It is difficult to determine the exact value or owner
    of a file. This is where the idea of NFT starts: The digital tokens contain information
    about a particular file that is both unique and verifiable. The blockchain technology
    is used to verify the authenticity of the files.'

    goods, such as cryptocurrencies, are stored in blocks and distributed on many
    computers worldwide. For example, Bitcoin is on a blockchain. Its architecture

    asset that is transferred from one person to the next, but a concrete asset –
    like a unique digital work of art that is linked to an owner and a value. Simply

    between fungible and not fungible. If something is fungible, it means that something
    is homogeneously interchangeable. Examples of this from the real world include
    banknotes or precious metals: one gram of pure gold is worth as much as another
    gram of pure gold. And if you give someone a ten-dollar note, it wouldn''t matter
    if they didn''t give back exactly the same note.'

    the same at first glance, but each ticket contains a different passenger name,
    a different destination and a different seat number. Therefore, there could also
    be serious consequences if you exchange a plane ticket for another. The same is
    true in the digital space with NFTs. Another example would be Internet domains,

    fluctuations. One of the criticisms concerns possible copyright violations. It
    becomes problematic, for example, if it is not verified whether a seller on the
    blockchain really owns the rights. In addition, the owner owns the crypto object
    only on the blockchain on which it was purchased. In most cases, this is the Ethereum
    blockchain. In theory, however, any object on other blockchains that support NFT

    requires the computing power of many computers, the power consumption is very
    high. NFT consist not only of a transaction, but of a variety of them, depending
    on the number of bids at an auction. As a result, the energy demand increases.
    The digital artist Memo Akten analyzed the energy expenditure of a single NFT-sale.
    On average, a sale consumes 340 kilowatt hours. By comparison, an ordinary Ethereum

    This information proves that each NFT is different and unique. That makes them
    "unique token-NFT." NFT's can represent anything that can be digitized. From a
    work of art to in-game products, many NFT can be created. Therefore, prices can
    reach high amounts due to the unique, unchangeable and non-copyable prices of

    and make money. Through NFTs, someone can buy a work of art and present it in
    a virtual space, with the blockchain proving ownership. Artists can thus protect
    their copyright and secure a larger share of the profits generated by the sale.
    In addition, it is possible to configure an NFT to create a recurring source of
    income where you can contribute to every subsequent sale of the NFT. Recently,
    some NFTs have already been sold for several hundred thousand dollars and many
