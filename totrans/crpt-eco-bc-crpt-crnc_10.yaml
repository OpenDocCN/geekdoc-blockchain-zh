    the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change
    that will occur in the next ten. Don’t let yourself be lulled into inaction.”'

    quick to forget all that happened over the previous ten years, which leads them
    to underestimate the potential change that will come in the next decade thanks
    to new technology. In previous chapters, we’ve looked at the remarkable changes
    that blockchain technology has made possible. In the years to come, I believe
    a whole new financial ecosystem built and centered around blockchain and cryptocurrency
    will become the norm. This brand-new system will exist detached from the dominant
    fiat money systems that will still be in place but will have regulation under
    the government closer to that of fiat money. It will pose a challenge to the regulators
    as governments are forced to make adjustments to adapt to this new, other financial
    ecosystem. The crypto economy currently stands at around $300 billion. Though
    it still can’t compare to the fiat money-based economies of the world, it’s still
    enormous and undeniable. In this last chapter, I’m going to let my imagination
    run wild a little bit and explore the potential innovations that I think could
    make crypto and blockchain explode even more dramatically in the years to come.

    degovernmentalization and gradually finds its way from small group of cypherpunks
    to the general public at large. But is that really so strange? How often do daring
    trends start as the fixation of a small group of evangelists but eventually find
    their way into everyone’s lives in one form or another?

    Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another cryptocurrency above all others. The winner of this
    contest will offer safety, soundness, and utility.

    future will come about by default. There may be a special likelihood of this in
    places like Venezuela, but it could also happen in countries like the US, where
    federal deficits are spiraling.

    convenience and anonymity it adds to transactions, Bitcoin has been one of the
    easiest way for criminals to undertake illegal financial activities. Illegal transactions
    and trading have generated considerable amount of wealth for certain individuals.
    One well-known example is the Silk Road that was a Dark Web website that sold
    everything from drugs to stolen goods to Mafia “hits.” It was designed to allow
    users to browse anonymously and securely with no potential for monitoring. Bitcoin
    was the chief currency used on the Silk Road. The FBI initially seized 26,000
    Bitcoins from accounts associated with the Silk Road, worth approximately $3.6
    million at the time. The site was ultimately shut down, and the mastermind behind
    it was sentenced to life in prison.

    is still associated in the public’s mind with money laundering and other illegal
    activities. As I’ve noted, different countries have different attitudes toward
    cryptocurrency and related financial tools. China and South Korea have banned
    ICOs, yet in some Mediterranean counties like Malta, cryptocurrency receives a
    warm welcome. The USA is still on the fence. The CFTC and the SEC—as well as individual
    states—have imposed some regulations on cryptocurrency and shut down some bad
    actors. For technology enthusiasts, the concern is that governments will shut
    down crypto everywhere if it is being used for illegal activity anywhere. For
    now, as the rapid growth of cryptocurrency continues, the shutting down of crypto
    entirely remains a very remote possibility.

    futures have been accepted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago
    Board of Exchange (CBOE). As to the true “value” of Bitcoin, we can reasonably
    compare it to gold. (To be clear, I’m not encouraging you to invest in Bitcoins
    here.) But two of the early investors in Bitcoin, who went on to become billionaires,
    the Winklevosses, have said they consider Bitcoin like a kind of “Gold 2.0.” A
    place to store value. Personally, I think Bitcoin has the potential to hold stronger
    value than gold. The value of gold comes from its scarcity and durability. But
    Bitcoin equals or surpasses gold when it comes to scarcity, portability, visibility,
    and fungibility. Bitcoin’s portability is an additional benefit over gold. So
    far, Bitcoin has about a $300 billion market cap, while gold is at $6 trillion.
    The Winklevosses believe that Bitcoin could very well increase in value another
    twenty times over what it’s worth today. In an interview with me, Tyler Winklevoss
    said he believes that one day the market cap of Bitcoin will equal or surpass
    that of gold. Still, there are uncertainties concerning Bitcoin as a store of
    value. The biggest among these may simply be the fact that there are still issues
    surrounding all cryptocurrencies. But the future will reveal itself as time goes
    by. We will have to be patient.

    to grow to slightly over $176 billion by 2025\. It will exceed $3.1 trillion by
    2030\. Gartner also believes that the entire blockchain industry is still in its
    “irrational exuberance stage” in which the current applications of blockchain
    are actually not disruptive enough. In the days ahead, IT leaders will cut through
    the hype and move to apply blockchain across industries in order to realize the
    maximum possible benefit.

    and decentralization. Decentralized digital currency will be regulated and will
    have learned to “play along” with regulators in order to grow its ultimate financial
    potential. Creative applications of blockchain to other purposes will come very
    soon thereafter. Currently, the major innovations brought about by blockchain
    are still infrastructure-based. In the future, this will change. The speed and
    efficiency of blockchain will be increased across the board. And as the various
    public blockchains keep evolving, we will see more and more DAPPS specific to
    various industries. Those DAPPs will focus on disruptive innovation in blockchain
    applications, which will have enormous consequences for big data, cloud computing,
    AI, and more.

    heavily disrupted by blockchain technology. Finance is on the top of that list,
    including subsets like banking, hedge funds, and insurance providers. But other
    industries will be impacted, as well. These include real estate, healthcare, supply
    and logistics, and public affairs. Because blockchain is like an unlimited account
    book when it comes to documenting data chronologically, the data stored in blockchain
    are always open to everyone to see and check. This kind of transparent technology
    can be applied to industries that rely on data and collaboration. Just think of
    the possibilities!

    to? That might not quite be possible in today’s climate. But as blockchain and
    cryptocurrency are further applied to the financial world, we will see decentralized
    exchanges and centralized exchanges working together. There will be a balance
    in the future. Blockchain is a technology that can bring us closer together, but
    it is still, like any technology, only as good as the humans behind it. As governments,
    regulators, and industries begin adopting and incorporating blockchain more and
    more, the interests of different communities will be both enhanced and protected.
    No matter what the founders’ intentions were, this will be a satisfying outcome.
