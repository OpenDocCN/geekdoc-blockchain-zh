    Of course, it is much safer to stay in the comfort zone and keep walking the beaten
    track. However, at some point, maybe it is worth asking yourself: how far will
    this track lead me? Most likely, it will lead you no further than the next door
    of your life.'

    things in order not to decay as the world keeps moving forward. This is true for
    many areas of our lives and in personal finances even more so.

    convenient to pay for our costs and comforts with the small plastic card issued
    by your bank. This type of cashless settlement is much better for security reasons
    as well.

    digital money or cryptocurrency. This is a new generation of currency that is
    created through the use of encryption software. These units of cryptocurrency
    are formed and preserved through algorithmic encryption.

    can solve. This is an issue I will bring up throughout this book, but for now
    I want to focus your attention on a concept called trust. It is this important
    problem which cryptocurrency solves. Let me explain using an example from my life.

    in school. Three school friends and I set out to sell flowers. Each of us wrote
    down the information about his earnings in an old notebook, which we passed on
    to each other. When this notebook ended up in my hands, and I really wanted ice
    cream , I wondered if I could change the written figures for my own benefit.
    But I scolded myself and thought: what if my friend did the same? Thus, it is
    obvious that distrust can arise even between the closest of friends. Cryptocurrency
    solves this problem as it does not allow us to add or change something once it
    is in the system.'

    should not be associated with the explosion of a comet, a gift from above, or
    any other sort of fairytale beginning. In fact, the creation of cryptocurrency
    is much simpler.

    cryptocurrency arose on their basis, followed by mining (the production of cryptocurrency).
    Only afterwards did tokens, ICOs, and various cryptocurrency business models came
    into being on the basis of this whole ecosystem. The registry, which protects
    against manipulation (i.e. database repository), became the very first technology
    in the cryptocurrency economy. There is one small (or rather big) peculiarity
    of such registries: you can enter any data into this database but cannot forge
    anything or enter backdated information. These self-enforcing contracts are the
    second important technology in the cryptocurrency world. They are tightly sewn
    to the database.'

    book as I explained the basics in my previous book, [Mastering Bitcoin for Starters.](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Starters-Cryptocurrency-Technologies-ebook/dp/B0741T771J/ref=sr_1_5?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1509101839&sr=1-5&keywords=bitcoin)
    In the present manual, I am going to tell you instead how cryptocurrency functions,
    the top ten cryptocurrencies, and what cryptocurrency exchanges and digital currency
    exchanges are. I will also explain the technical implementation of Blockchain,
    the Ethereum platform, and many other issues of the cryptocurrency world. The
    most interesting point is that I will outline plenty of smart investment strategies.

    and changing. It works 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Therefore, the information
    which was up-to-date the day I wrote the book may not be quite as fresh the day
    you read it. I will recommend resources in this book that you may refer to in
    order to keep up with the times.

    of this book. I agree that we should meet all new ideas while maintaining a degree
    of scepticism, but we should also be reasonable. Therefore, before making hasty
    conclusions about cryptocurrency, I suggest carefully reading the book and then
    analyzing the information I share here. With that being said, put your verdict
    on cryptocurrency into cold storage for now.'
