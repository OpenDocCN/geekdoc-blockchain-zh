  zh: 为什么你应该阅读这本书
- en: 'Most people receive new ideas with great fear, scepticism, and even denial.
    Of course, it is much safer to stay in the comfort zone and keep walking the beaten
    track. However, at some point, maybe it is worth asking yourself: how far will
    this track lead me? Most likely, it will lead you no further than the next door
    of your life.'

  zh: 大多数人对新想法抱有极大的恐惧、怀疑甚至否认。当然，待在舒适区，走别人已经走过的路要安全得多。然而，在某个时刻，也许值得问自己：这条路会把我带到多远？很可能，它只会把你带到你生活的一扇门那里。
- en: Movement is progress. Therefore, you should keep an open mind and learn new
    things in order not to decay as the world keeps moving forward. This is true for
    many areas of our lives and in personal finances even more so.

  zh: 运动就是进步。因此，你应该保持开放的心态，学习新事物，以不被世界向前发展所淘汰。这一点在我们的生活中许多领域都适用，在个人财务上更是如此。
- en: For one, paper money is no longer prevalent. You will probably agree it is more
    convenient to pay for our costs and comforts with the small plastic card issued
    by your bank. This type of cashless settlement is much better for security reasons
    as well.

  zh: 首先，纸币已经不再普遍。你可能同意，用银行发给你的小塑料卡支付我们的费用和舒适更加方便。这种无现金支付方式在安全性上也更有优势。
- en: Not so long ago, humanity discovered another, completely new type of money –
    digital money or cryptocurrency. This is a new generation of currency that is
    created through the use of encryption software. These units of cryptocurrency
    are formed and preserved through algorithmic encryption.

  zh: 不久以前，人类发现了另一种完全新的货币类型——数字货币或加密货币。这是一种通过加密软件创建的新一代货币。这些数字货币单位是通过算法加密形成并保存的。
- en: I would like to focus a little bit on the kinds of problems that cryptocurrency
    can solve. This is an issue I will bring up throughout this book, but for now
    I want to focus your attention on a concept called trust. It is this important
    problem which cryptocurrency solves. Let me explain using an example from my life.

  zh: 我想稍微关注一下加密货币可以解决的问题。这是我在整本书中都会提到的议题，但现在我想集中你们的注意力在一个叫做信任的概念上。正是这个重要的问题，加密货币解决了。让我用我生活中的一个例子来解释。
- en: 'I decided that I wanted to create a business and make some money when I was
    in school. Three school friends and I set out to sell flowers. Each of us wrote
    down the information about his earnings in an old notebook, which we passed on
    to each other. When this notebook ended up in my hands, and I really wanted ice
    cream , I wondered if I could change the written figures for my own benefit.
    But I scolded myself and thought: what if my friend did the same? Thus, it is
    obvious that distrust can arise even between the closest of friends. Cryptocurrency
    solves this problem as it does not allow us to add or change something once it
    is in the system.'

  zh: 当我还在学校的时候，我决定要创办一家公司赚点钱。我和三个同学一起开始卖花。我们每个人都在一本旧笔记本上写下自己的收入信息，然后传给对方。当这本笔记本最后到了我手上，我真的很想吃冰淇淋呵呵，我想到自己是否可以为了自己的利益更改书面数字。但我批评了自己，想：如果我的朋友做同样的事呢？因此，很明显，即使是在最亲密的朋友之间，不信任也可能产生。加密货币解决了这个问题，因为它不允许我们在信息进入系统后添加或更改任何内容。
- en: However, the emergence of cryptocurrency, which solves the huge problem of trust,
    should not be associated with the explosion of a comet, a gift from above, or
    any other sort of fairytale beginning. In fact, the creation of cryptocurrency
    is much simpler.

  zh: 然而，解决了信任这一巨大问题的加密货币的出现，不应该与彗星的爆炸、来自上天的礼物或其他童话故事的开头联系在一起。实际上，加密货币的创建要简单得多。
- en: 'First, the corresponding technologies, such as EXAMPLE, appeared, and then
    cryptocurrency arose on their basis, followed by mining (the production of cryptocurrency).
    Only afterwards did tokens, ICOs, and various cryptocurrency business models came
    into being on the basis of this whole ecosystem. The registry, which protects
    against manipulation (i.e. database repository), became the very first technology
    in the cryptocurrency economy. There is one small (or rather big) peculiarity
    of such registries: you can enter any data into this database but cannot forge
    anything or enter backdated information. These self-enforcing contracts are the
    second important technology in the cryptocurrency world. They are tightly sewn
    to the database.'

  zh: 首先，出现了相应的技术，比如EXAMPLE，然后基于这些技术产生了加密货币，接着出现了挖矿（加密货币的生产）。在此之后，代币，ICO和各种加密货币商业模式在这个整个生态系统的基础上产生。注册表，防止操纵（即数据库存储），成为了加密货币经济中的第一种技术。这种注册表有一个小（或者说是大）的特点：你可以将任何数据输入这个数据库，但不能伪造任何东西或输入旧信息。这些自我执行的合同是加密货币世界的第二种重要技术。它们与数据库紧密相连。
- en: I won’t take a deep dive into the details behind all of this technology in this
    book as I explained the basics in my previous book, [Mastering Bitcoin for Starters.](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Starters-Cryptocurrency-Technologies-ebook/dp/B0741T771J/ref=sr_1_5?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1509101839&sr=1-5&keywords=bitcoin)
    In the present manual, I am going to tell you instead how cryptocurrency functions,
    the top ten cryptocurrencies, and what cryptocurrency exchanges and digital currency
    exchanges are. I will also explain the technical implementation of Blockchain,
    the Ethereum platform, and many other issues of the cryptocurrency world. The
    most interesting point is that I will outline plenty of smart investment strategies.

  zh: 我不会在这本书中深入探讨这些技术的细节，因为我已经在我的上一本书《Mastering Bitcoin for Starters》中解释了基础知识。[Mastering
    Bitcoin for Starters](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Starters-Cryptocurrency-Technologies-ebook/dp/B0741T771J/ref=sr_1_5?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1509101839&sr=1-5&keywords=bitcoin)在这本手册中，我将告诉你加密货币是如何工作的，最流行的十大加密货币，以及加密货币交易所和数字货币交易所是什么。我还将解释区块链的技术实现，以太坊平台，以及加密货币世界的许多其他问题。最有趣的是，我将概述许多智能投资策略。
- en: Right from the start, I want to warn you that the cryptocurrency market is alive
    and changing. It works 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Therefore, the information
    which was up-to-date the day I wrote the book may not be quite as fresh the day
    you read it. I will recommend resources in this book that you may refer to in
    order to keep up with the times.

  zh: 从一开始，我想警告你们，加密货币市场是充满活力并且变化的。它每天24小时，每周7天运作。因此，我写书的那天更新的信息可能在你读它的时候已经不那么新鲜了。在这本书中，我会推荐一些资源，你可以参考以跟上时代。
- en: 'The last thing to mention here: I suppose there are sceptics among the readers
    of this book. I agree that we should meet all new ideas while maintaining a degree
    of scepticism, but we should also be reasonable. Therefore, before making hasty
    conclusions about cryptocurrency, I suggest carefully reading the book and then
    analyzing the information I share here. With that being said, put your verdict
    on cryptocurrency into cold storage for now.'

  zh: 在这里最后要提的一点是：我想这本书的读者中有一些怀疑论者。我同意我们应该对新思想保持一定的怀疑态度，但我们也应该理性。因此，在匆忙地对加密货币做出结论之前，我建议仔细阅读这本书，然后分析我这里分享的信息。说到这里，现在把你对加密货币的裁决放入冷藏吧。
