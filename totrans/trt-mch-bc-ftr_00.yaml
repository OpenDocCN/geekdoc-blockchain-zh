- en: In The Age of Cryptocurrency, we explored the digital currency bitcoin and its
    promise of a fairer global payments system, one that functions without banks and
    other financial intermediaries. As that book was going to print, Bitcoin’s[*](footnote.xhtml#footnote-1425-1)
    wider application—how its core operating system can help resolve problems of trust
    between individuals and businesses when they trade assets, enter into contracts,
    assert claims to property, or share valuable or sensitive information—came to
    the fore. Within companies, governments, and the media, a groundswell of interest,
    including a fair bit of hype, turned toward what became known as “blockchain technology.”

- en: In resolving longstanding problems of trust and enabling a community to track
    its transactions without entrusting that record-keeping process to a central intermediary,
    the blockchain idea promised a way to bypass the various gatekeepers who control
    society’s exchanges of value. It could, for instance, let a neighborhood of “prosumers”—households
    that both consume power and produce it with solar panels on their roofs—trade
    energy among themselves within a decentralized marketplace and without a profit-driven
    utility company setting the rates. Similarly, property owners, buyers, and mortgage
    lenders would not have to trust an unreliable government registry as the only
    record of deeds and liens when a more trustworthy one could be built on an immutable
    database managed by a decentralized network with less risk of corruption, human
    failure, or theft. These are just some of the many new applications that attracted
    people’s attention to this innovative idea.

- en: The zeitgeist of public awareness had two big impacts on our lives. The first
    was that one of us—Michael Casey—got so excited about blockchain technology’s
    potential to change the world that he quit a twenty-three-year career in journalism
    to work on it full time. Less than six months after The Age of Cryptocurrency
    was published, Mike left The Wall Street Journal for MIT’s Media Lab. The lab’s
    frenetic director, Joichi Ito, who is commonly known as Joi, had recognized parallels
    between Bitcoin’s emergence and the software development he’d witnessed during
    the early days of the Internet. Sensing a similar enthusiasm for a new, decentralizing
    architecture, Ito hatched a plan to bring powerful academic and financial resources
    to the vital task of developing this nascent technology. The result was MIT’s
    Digital Currency Initiative, a center where leading academics and students in
    the fields of cryptography, engineering, and finance could collaborate with Fortune
    500 strategists, innovative startups, philanthropists, and government officials
    to design the digital architecture of a new “Internet of Value.” When Mike received
    an offer to join this initiative, he saw a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get
    in on the ground floor of an economic revolution.

- en: 'The second impact is the book you are reading. In The Age of Cryptocurrency,
    we focused primarily on a single application of Bitcoin’s core technology, on
    its potential to upend currency and payments. Since the book’s publication, though,
    we have learned there’s a risk in writing about technology: it changes, while
    the words on the page do not. So much has changed in three years, in fact, that
    we were compelled to write another book. The Truth Machine expands the conversation
    we began in 2015 and takes it to a level higher. It explores how Bitcoin’s technology
    and its various offshoots point to a general redesign of social organizations,
    fostering many more alternative applications.'

- en: In the modern economy, to control information is to control the world. This
    is seen in the ever-growing influence of tech behemoths like Google and Facebook,
    constantly accumulating data that’s pertinent to who we are and how we interact
    with each other. In this twenty-first-century economy, power is defined by whoever
    has authority to collect, store, and share data. Currently, that authority is
    centralized. It is concentrated among a narrow number of giant tech companies.
    If you’re wondering why that’s problematic, just think of the influence that Facebook’s
    hidden algorithm, which prioritizes the company’s business model above all other
    objectives, has had on our politics. In incentivizing the creation and sharing
    of often-dubious information to trigger dopamine releases among social networks
    of like-minded people, its algorithm played an instrumental role in the bombshell
    U.S. elections of 2016.

- en: The ideas behind the blockchain[*](footnote.xhtml#footnote-1425-2) have now
    unleashed a struggle to turn that structure of concentrated power on its head,
    to figure out how the capacity to control and manage information might shift to
    a decentralized system that no one controls. It lets us imagine a world that’s
    not dominated by Google, Facebook, or, for that matter, the NSA, one where we,
    the people, the core components of global society, get to say how our data is
    managed.
