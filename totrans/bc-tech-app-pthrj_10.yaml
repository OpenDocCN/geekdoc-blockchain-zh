- en: Blockchain is an interesting technology which offers a secured mode for digital
    transactions. It acts like a ‘distributed ledger’ which records every transaction
    in a secure, auditable, efficient and transparent manner. This concept is new
    and has many applications and relevance in various business domains. Blockchain
    is simply a database system that holds a continuously growing distributed set
    of data records. Every transaction is digitally verified and signed to assure
    the authenticity. There is no master server which holds the entire chain. All
    the participating computers (nodes) possess a copy of the transaction chain. [Figure
    11.1](chapter11.xhtml#fig11.1) illustrates the working of typical blockchain architecture
    [[1](#re_TNF-CH011_CIT00001)].

    most of the nodes participating in the blockchain implementation run algorithms
    to verify and evaluate the history of every blockchain block that is considered.
    If the majority of the participating nodes feels the history and digital signature
    are valid, the new transaction block is accepted into the distributed ledger and
    a new block is appended to the transaction chain. If majority of the participating
    nodes doesn’t feel the digital signature as authentic, then the change request
    or the addition request is denied and discarded. Thus this distributed consensus
    model permits blockchain to act as a distributed ledger which doesn’t require
    some centralized authority to validate the records or transactions.

    all the transactions in a system. Any change can be initiated by the central coordinator.
    But the people working with a centralized system can tamper with the data of various
    transactions without the knowledge of other clients. This may lead to serious
    problems in case of a financial organization. Blockchain overcomes this demerit
    by providing a de-centralized system where the transaction chain is distributed
    among the participating clients or nodes. Whenever a node or a client tries to
    modify the data, it is intimated to all the other clients participating in that
    system. Thus it is impossible to tamper with the data without the consent of a
    majority of participating clients inside a blockchain. Thus decentralization became
    a key property of blockchain technology.

    it is considered as a secure system. Of course the system is secure and all the
    transactions and details of clients involved are stored in an encrypted form.
    But still if any clients tries to access or modify a transaction, all the participating
    clients will be alerted and thus it achieves transparency.

    to the system, it is impossible to tamper with the same. This is one of the unique
    properties of blockchain compared to other similar techniques like Bitcoin and
    centralized systems. Immutability is achieved in blockchain using some cryptographic
    hash function. Blockchain can be considered as a linked list which includes data
    and a hash pointer. The hash pointer points to its previous block and thus generates
    a chain of blocks. A hash pointer is similar to a pointer in a linked list, but
    instead of simply holding the address of the previous block it also holds the
    hash of the data inside the previous block existing in the chain.

    The blockchain is maintained by peer–peer network architecture. In a peer–peer
    model, there is no single centralized server. Every system participating in the
    network has equal priority. Every system can communicate with the others. The
    same system can work as both client as well as server in different instances.
    Thus there will be multiple distributed and decentralized servers. Though the
    system is using a peer–peer model, there will not be a single point of failure.

    Things (IoT) is a networked class of devices, sensors and actuators deployed in
    distinct locations [[2](#re_TNF-CH011_CIT00002)]. The connection between various
    components can be wired or wireless. Each device in the network should have a
    unique address. IPv6 protocol is used for the same as it can address up to millions

    systems. These collected data are processed accordingly and the required information
    is extracted to derive conclusions. This model is used in weather forecasting,
    stock market prediction, smart farming, patient health monitoring, etc. The concept
    of cloud computing provides various functionalities to the IoT systems like data
    analysis and data processing. This unprecedented development in the IoT has paved
    the way for new mechanisms to access and share information. But due to the transparent
    nature of IoT systems, end users lack the confidence to share sensitive information
    through IoT systems. Centralized architecture is used in most of the IoT applications
    where the network participants don’t have a clear vision of the shared data through
    the network. The shared information may look like a black box, and the users don’t
    know the authenticity and source of data. The need for blockchain in IoT is discussed

    of failure which may be exploited by cyber attackers (e.g. distributed-denial-of-service

    simultaneously may lead to system collapse. Another key concern is the presence
    of a central cloud service provider in an IoT environment. Any failure to this
    central node may lead to vulnerability which should be addressed. One of the most
    critical issues is data authentication and confidentiality. A lack of data security
    in IoT devices can be exploited and may be used in an inappropriate manner. Due
