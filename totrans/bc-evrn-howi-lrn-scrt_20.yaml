  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “A Polish energy drink company,” I repeated stupidly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    the color of factory smoke. My body had given up on time zones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “They really want to move forward on our proposal,” Pete said on the satellite
    window, “but they need to meet you first.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “At least $25K. More to follow.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s agency work, Pete,” I sighed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We need it,” Jade cut in. “Still no payment from Sooyoung. Also . . .” She
    paused. “We lost another client today.” I deflated further.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Our existing agency clients are asking, ‘Do you guys even do agency work anymore?’ ”
    Pete said, peering over his glasses. “They go to our website, all they see is
    blockchain, blockchain, blockchain.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s like we’re running two companies,” said Jade. “The old agency business
    and the new blockchain business.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It is a weird time of transition,” I admitted. “Hence my meeting today with
    a Polish energy drink company.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pete let out a hoot. “We’ve already presented to their marketing director,”
    he recounted. “Now we just need to pitch to their executive team.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Who?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The founder and the CFO.” The big guy and the money guy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Do you think they’ll give me an energy drink beforehand?” I rubbed my eyes.
    “I could use one . . . or twelve.”

- en: The receptionist did offer me a sample, which tasted like Red Bull. It was a
    sleek white lobby pulsing with excitement, with framed photos of young people
    enjoying high-energy activities like dancing and crushing homework. Electronica
    pulsed from white Bose speakers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “This way.” The receptionist ushered me into a drab conference room, where a
    trio of dour-faced executives were waiting. It was such a stark contrast from
    the lobby that I was thrown momentarily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Hello!” I greeted them, a little too loudly. The energy drink was kicking in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “John.” The marketing director nodded. “Good to meet you in person. This is
    my assistant, and our CFO, Bartosz.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “A pleasure to meet you all.” We shook hands and I pulled out my laptop. “I
    kicked back a can before I came in, so forgive me if I’m a little wired.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes.” She stared at me, stone-faced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“Speaking of wired,” I said, “do you have a cable to your screen here?” This
    was the ritual before every meeting: spend fifteen minutes trying to get the laptop
    connected to the screen. The assistant jumped up to help.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Where’s your founder?” I asked politely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “He is not here,” said the marketing director.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Okay.” Silence. “Should we wait for him?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “He is in Bangkok.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I blinked. I . . . came to Poland for this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We can make the decision ourselves,” Bartosz stated stiffly. I noticed he didn’t
    have a laptop, just a yellow legal pad. He nodded toward the screen, now connected
    to my laptop. “Please give your presentation.”
  prefs: []

- en: “BLOCKCHAIN!” I was riding the Polish Bull. “It’s the greatest technology of
    our time! And it is changing the world.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I pulled up a slide that listed hundreds of blockchain projects, grouped by
    industry. “Blockchain is disrupting finance, health care, education, supply chains,
    even government. Blockchain is the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I flew here from this blockchain convention”—I clicked to a picture of the
    convention floor packed wall-to-wall with well-dressed Swiss bankers—“and, boy,
    are my arms not tired. Thanks to your beverage.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Somber silence. I was fighting a cold war.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Here’s the opportunity,” I pitched. “The Official Energy Drink of the Blockchain
    Revolution. Imagine giving away your beverage at blockchain conferences around
    the world. Maybe you make a new flavor. Can you double the caffeine?” I shouted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We can double the caffeine, yes,” the marketing director replied.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What the hey, triple it!” I clicked to the next slide. “But it gets better.
    Imagine if every can comes with a coin.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “In the can?” Bartosz asked. “People will choke.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Not a physical coin,” I explained, “a blockchain-based token. Your own digital
    currency!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The can is the cryptocurrency,” the marketing director explained to Bartosz.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The can is the coin! Customers will buy more cans, so they earn more coins.
    They can buy and sell your coins—your blockchain tokens—on exchanges.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s like reward points,” the marketing director translated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Like reward points that have real-world value!” I was on a roll. “Can you imagine
    how that would boost sales? Your customers would drink nothing else. Let’s patent
    this!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “How does this work?” asked Bartosz, confused.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Imagine a scannable code on the can,” I began.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “A QR code,” the marketing director helped me. “Like we did for our giveaway.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“Right.” I pointed at her. “You buy a can, you scan the code on the can with
    your phone, it opens an app that awards you one coin. Let’s call this idea CaffeineChain.”
    I grabbed my Moleskine notebook and sketched out:'

- en: “You’re creating these coins—let’s call them CaffeineCoins—out of thin air,”
    I explained, “but they have real-world value, because people will be able to redeem
    them for real-world prizes, like trips and concerts.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The marketing director was nodding. “Like our sweepstakes last year.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Just think of them like reward points, stored on the blockchain. The difference
    is that people can buy and sell the rewards points with each other.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Who determines the value of the rewards points?” asked Bartosz.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The market!” I exclaimed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “So five thousand CaffeineCoins earn you one trip,” Bartosz reasoned, “and the
    trip costs us five thousand złotych. One CaffeineCoin equals one złoty. Now people
    start trading CaffeineCoins for double the price. One CaffeineCoin now equals
    two złotych. Why would anyone redeem them for the trip?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Maybe they start buying CaffeineCoins as an investment!” I smiled confidently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Now say they go down to half the value. Or a tenth the value. Let’s say you
    can go buy as many CaffeineCoins as you want and redeem them for prizes—which
    we have to pay for, with real money.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But that wouldn’t happen,” I objected, “as long as they can be redeemed for
    real-world value. The market will gravitate toward the value of your prizes.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Hmph.” He tapped his pen. “Who oversees all this?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s the best part!” I replied brightly. “It’s decentralized! No one owns
    it!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “So we have people buying and selling an unregulated security, on an unlicensed
    exchange, and we are directly liable.” He glared at me. “And it is called ‘CaffeineCoin.’ ”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I looked over at the marketing director. No help there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It doesn’t have to be called CaffeineCoin,” I replied, crashing down from my
    caffeine high. “Look, your founder is totally on board with this idea. He gets
    it.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“Our founder is in Bangkok,” said Bartosz. I glanced at his yellow legal pad.
    He had written only one word, crossed out:'

- en: When I got back to my hotel room, I had an email from the energy drink founder
    waiting for me. I flipped open the videoconference app and gave him a call.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “John? Hey.” It was dark on his side, and I could barely make him out. “Sorry
    I couldn’t be there today. I’m in Bangkok.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I heard.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “How’d it go?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Bartosz is a tough sell.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He laughed. “That’s why he’s in charge of the money.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What brings you to Bangkok?” I asked. “Business?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No, just chilling. Here, let me turn on a light.” Suddenly his video window
    came to life to reveal he wasn’t wearing a shirt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You know, I’m a serial entrepreneur,” he said lazily, a beer in hand. “Started
    the energy drink company, bought a boatload of bitcoin, now I’m kind of a digital
    nomad. Right now I’m spending a few months in Thailand.” I heard what sounded
    like an electric bug zapper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I reflected on my life, which consisted of nonstop work, versus his life, which
    looked like nonstop leisure. Yet he had the profitable energy drink company, and
    we were struggling to get payment from our horrible banking client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Maybe I should put on some clothes,” he laughed, as if seeing my dress shirt
    and sport coat for the first time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I always dress up for videoconferences,” I said, “but you do you.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “One second.” He left the camera on, and I reflected on what was happening.
    I came to Warsaw to videoconference with him in Thailand. Off camera, the bug
    zapper again. Distantly, a rooster crowed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He came back a few minutes later wearing a white linen shirt left unbuttoned.
    He was in remarkably good shape, and I briefly worried this videoconference might
    go somewhere unexpected. “So, we going to do this thing, or what?” he asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Bartosz didn’t seem too hot on it,” I confessed. “Even though I brought the
    energy.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Look, the final decision is mine. It’s a great idea. The Official Energy Drink
    of the Blockchain Revolution. The can is the coin. We’ll figure out the details
    as we go along. That’s what entrepreneurs do.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Absolutely.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    this! But just before I drifted off to sleep, an unwelcome thought jostled its
    way into my head: What, exactly, are we doing?'
