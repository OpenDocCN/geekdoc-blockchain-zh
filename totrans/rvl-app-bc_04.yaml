- en: In this era of explosive growth in technology, the internet of things (IoT)
    has become the game changer when we consider technologies like smart homes and
    cities, smart energy, security and surveillance, and healthcare. The numerous
    benefits provided by IoT have become attractive technologies for users and cybercriminals.
    Cybercriminals of today have the tools and the technology to deploy millions of
    sophisticated attacks. These attacks need to be investigated; this is where digital
    forensics comes into play. However, it is not easy to conduct a forensic investigation
    in IoT systems because of the heterogeneous nature of the IoT environment. Additionally,
    forensic investigators mostly rely on evidence from service providers, a situation
    that can lead to evidence contamination. To solve this problem, the authors proposed
    a blockchain-based IoT forensic model that prevents the admissibility of tampered
    logs into evidence.

- en: In this era of explosive growth in technology, the Internet of Things (IoT)
    has become the game changer when we consider technologies like smart homes and
    cities; smart energy, security and surveillance and healthcare. In a report, Statista
    predicted that the number of IoT device will reach 75 billion in 2025 (Statista,
    2019). The integration of real-world objects with the internet does not only bring
    numerous advantages but also bring cybersecurity threats to our life, through
    our interaction with these devices (A. Jurcut et al., 2020). Like any computing
    technology, IoT is threatened by security issues. Many researchers and device
    manufacturers are exploring various techniques to ensure the security of IoT devices
    as well as protect the data generated by these devices. However, according to
    (Atlam et al., 2017), it is difficult to secure data produce in IoT environments
    because of the heterogeneity and dynamic features deployed in these devices. It
    is therefore not surprising that the security of IoT, ranging from the physical
    security of the devices through to the security of their architecture has become
    an important area of research for a lot of researchers (A. D. Jurcut et al., 2020).

- en: Currently, several works are being done to ensure data confidentiality, access
    control, authentication, privacy and trust in IoT environments (Borhani et al.,
    2020; Braeken et al., 2019; A. Jurcut et al., 2009, 2012; A. D. Jurcut, 2018;
    A. D. Jurcut et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019). Although a lot
    of success has been made in the security of IoT using the parameters mentioned
    above, attackers still find ways to exploit the vulnerabilities that exist in
    IoT systems (A. D. Jurcut et al., 2020). These billions of IoT devices contain
    sensitive data, an attribute that makes them attractive to cyber-attacks. The
    number and the cost of cyber-attacks have been increasing over the years. According
    to a report by (Morgan, 2017), the damages caused by cybercrimes will cost a whopping
    6 trillion dollars by 2021\. These attacks need to be investigated; this is where
    digital forensics comes into play.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Digital forensics helps in acquiring legal evidence that can be used to know
    more about these attacks, prevent future attacks and most importantly prosecute
    the perpetrators of these crimes. However, it is not easy to conduct a forensic
    investigation in IoT systems. According to (Perumal et al., 2015), the heterogeneity
    and dynamic nature of IoT systems make it practically difficult to use the same
    frameworks used in traditional digital forensic in IoT environments. It is therefore
    expedient to develop frameworks that can be used in IoT environments considering
    their dynamic and heterogeneity nature.

    of logs produced in IoT environments. The main idea of this model is to ensure
    the credibility and authenticity of logs produced by IoT devices during forensic
    investigations. Our model uses the decentralized approach and the immutability
    property of blockchain to ensure that logs and other pieces of evidence produced
    in IoT environments can be verified by forensic stakeholders. Our proposed model
    prevents Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) or Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) from
    tendering in false evidence during forensic investigations or court proceedings.
    The proposed model brings the court, LEAs, CSPs and other stakeholders under one
    umbrella where each stakeholder can verify the authenticity of the evidence presented
    by any of them. The model also ensures that pieces of evidence are not tampered
    with during the chain of custody. We start this chapter by providing an introduction
    to digital forensics in IoT and blockchain. We then continue by describing our
    proposed model. The benefits of our model are discussed and then we present our
    conclusion.

    and blockchain.

- en: 2.1 Digital Forensics
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Several definitions have been given for digital forensics. (Bellegarde et al.,
    2010) defined computer forensics as “the preservation, identification, extraction,
    interpretation, and documentation of computer evidence to include the rules of
    evidence, legal process, the integrity of evidence, factual reporting of the information
    and providing expert opinion in a court of law or other legal and/or administrative
    proceedings as to what was found.” The concept of digital forensics and computer
    forensics are closely related with the latter being the subset of the former.
    The most widely accepted definition of digital forensics is the one proposed during
    the first digital forensic research workshop and was stated by authors in (James
    et al., 2015) as “The use of scientifically derived and proven methods toward
    the preservation, collection, validation, identification, analysis, interpretation,
    documentation and presentation of digital evidence derived from digital sources
    to facilitate or further the reconstruction of events found to be criminal, or
    helping to anticipate unauthorized actions shown to be disruptive to planned operations.”
    Digital forensics involves the application of scientific methods in investigating
    cyber-crimes (Carrier, 2003). According to (Sumalatha & Batsa, 2016), the methodologies
    employed in digital forensics to handle electronic evidence has its stems springing
    out from forensic science.

    being presented in a court for prosecution purposes. (Daniel & Daniel, 2012) stated
    that the digital forensic is made up of four processes. These processes are identification,
    collection, organization, and presentation. Similarly, (Zawoad et al., 2015) enumerated
    the stages of digital forensics as identification, preservation, analysis, and
    presentation. According to (Hemdan & Manjaiah, 2018), digital forensics involves
    the application of scientific processes in identifying, collecting, organizing
    and presenting evidence. Ken Zatyko, the a former director of the US Defense Computer
    Forensics Laboratory outlined an eight-step process that makes digital forensic
    a scientific process (Zawoad et al., 2015). These eight steps include (Zawoad
    et al., 2015): obtaining the search authority, documenting the chain of custody,
    imaging, and hashing of evidence, validating tools used in the forensic process,
    analysing evidence, repeating and reproducing to ensure quality assurance, report
    by documenting the procedures used in the forensic process and then finally, present
    an expert witness in a court of law.'

    The first is the identification of the incident and the second is the identification
    of the evidence. There must be a direct correlation between the incident and the
    evidence being identified (Daniel & Daniel, 2012).

    methods may include imaging the original copy of the evidence. This stage also
    involves preserving the integrity of the evidence (Daniel & Daniel, 2012).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This stage has two main steps including evidence examination and evidence analysis.
    Some researchers separate these two steps distinctively. During the evidence examination,
    the investigator performs a thorough inspection of the data being used as evidence
    (Daniel & Daniel, 2012). This inspection may involve the use of different forensic
    tools. These tools are used for extracting and filtering data that is of interest
    to the investigator and relevant to the investigation process (Zawoad & Hasan,
    2015). The analysis phase involves reconstructing events by analysing the data
    collected. The rationale behind the evidence analysis is to discover any evidential
    material which will aid the technical as well as the legal perspective of the
    case (Ademu et al., 2011).

    be presented to a court of law. This stage includes the investigator preparing
    an organized report to state the findings he or she made during the investigation
    process (Daniel & Daniel, 2012). These findings are then presented to a court
    of law with the investigator serving as an expert witness if there is a need to
    testify (Ieong, 2006).

    area by both industry and academia. Although the purpose of both digital and IoT
    forensics, is to extract digital information using a scientific approach; the
    scope available when it comes to information extraction is wider in IoT forensics.
    According to (Atlam et al., 2017; Raghavan, 2013), IoT forensics is made up of
    the cloud, network and the device level forensics. Similarly, (Stoyanova et al.,
    2020) defined IoT forensics as an aspect of digital forensics with the identification,
    collection, organization, and presentation of evidence happening within the IoT
    ecosystem. They also broke IoT forensics into Cloud, Network, and Device-level
    forensics.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology is a decentralized
    and distributed ledger that contains chains of blocks of various transactions
    joined together by cryptographic hashes. According to (Gaur et al., 2018), the
    blockchain is “an immutable ledger for recording transactions, maintained within
    a distributed network of mutually untrusted peers.” Any transaction coming from
    a node is validated by other participating nodes in the blockchain network. After
    the validation, the set of transactions is added to the block by special nodes
    called miners as in the case of bitcoin. A miner is a node with sufficient computational
    power to solve a cryptographic puzzle. Blockchain uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.
    This architecture makes it possible for each node to communicate with a set of
    neighbour nodes, then each of these nodes also communicate with their neighbour
    nodes and the communication goes on and on. The blockchain is designed in such
    a way that any node can join and leave the network at will. Certain key elements
    are needed in the design and implementation of blockchain technology. These elements
    are:'

    of cryptocurrency applications like bitcoin is avoided. Timestamping is achieved
    by collecting pending transactions into the block and then calculating the hash
    of the block. This can prove that a transaction existed at the time of creating
    the block since it is hashed onto the block.'

    node from creating a fake transaction since each transaction is signed by a node
    or a user using their private key. Similarly, (Gaur et al., 2018) also identifies
    four blocks within a blockchain framework. These blocks are: the shared ledger,
    cryptography, consensus, and the smart contracts.'

    data security and integrity. Mining is done based on the sequence of transactions;
    a situation can only be changed by redoing the proof-of-work. Mining introduces
    the difficulty in block generation. There are other methods available ensuring
    data security and integrity. Some of these methods are proof-of-authority (PoA),
    proof-of-existence (PoE) and proof-of-concept (PoC). A blockchain can either be
    permissionless or permissioned. A permission-less blockchain also known as public
    blockchain allows any node to join and leave at any point in time, whereas private
    or permissioned blockchain allows nodes to be authenticated before joining the
    network.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we explore some works that are closely related to ours. Blockchain
    has been widely used in the area of IoT security. However, the concept is still
    in its exploratory stage when it comes to IoT forensics. (Meffert et al., 2017)
    proposed a framework that helps evidence acquisition in IoT forensic. Using a
    centralized approach, the framework is deployed in three nodes namely; controller
    to IoT device, controller to cloud and controller to controller. Although, the
    proof of concept used in this work showed that the proposed framework can pull
    forensic data from IoT devices. However, the centralized nature of their approach
    makes it difficult to authenticate the evidence captured by the framework. (Li
    et al., 2019) also used a digital witness approach that allows people to shared
    logs from IoT devices with guaranteed privacy. The authors used the Privacy-aware
    IoT Forensics (PRoFIT) model proposed in their earlier work to deploy their digital
    witness model. The method proposed in their work is to help collect digital evidence
    in IoT environments as well as ensuring that the privacy of the evidence collected
    is maintained. The proposed method supports 11 privacy principles captured (Nieto
    et al., 2018) in their PRoFIT methodology. In their work, (Nieto et al., 2017)
    proposed a distributed logging scheme for IoT forensics. In this work, the authors
    used a Modified Information Dispersal Algorithm (MIDA) that ensures the availability
    of logs generated in IoT environments. The logs are aggregated, compressed, authenticated
    and dispersed. The distributed approach used in this work only focuses on how
    logs are stored but not how they are verified. Leveraging the immutability property
    of blockchain technology, (Noura et al., 2020) proposed an IoT forensics framework
    that uses a permissioned-based blockchain. This framework enhances the integrity,
    authenticity and non-repudiation of pieces of evidence.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we present our blockchain-based forensic model for IoT (BLOF).
    In IoT environments, there are three layers. These are the cloud, network and
    the device layer. Our model leverages the decentralized property of blockchain
    to ensure that the logs produced in IoT environments are stored on the network
    and are available for the verification by any of the participating nodes in the
    network. There are several artefacts to be considered when conducting a forensic
    investigation. However, our model focuses only on system and event logs. The entities
    in our model are the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Network Devices and the IoT
    devices. The entities serve as the blockchain nodes in the network. New nodes
    are added to the network through a key generation process. The public key of a
    node is appended to a transaction before it is written onto the block. New nodes
    generate a pair of keys. The CSPs act as the miners in the network. Their computational
    capacity of CSPs makes them ideal candidates for mining. Our model is made up
    of a Blockchain Centre (BC), Log Processing Centre (LPC) and User Centre (UC).
    In the preceding subsections, we discuss each of these components into details.
    The proposed model is shown in Figure 1.

- en: 4.1 Blockchain Centre
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The blockchain centre is made up of a distributed ledger where each log is written
    onto a block after processing. The distributed ledger is made up of all blocks
    that have been committed to the network. Each block contains a transactional value
    of hashed values computed from logs. The logs are extracted from the various entities,
    hashed and written onto the blockchain network as transactions. The nodes in the
    BC are made up of forensic stakeholders, network and IoT devices and cloud service
    providers. The blocks are proposed after a consensus has been reached by the nodes.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This component of our model handles the log processing. The LPC is an Application
    Programming Interface (API) that sits between entities and the blockchain network.
    The LPC extracts the logs from the IoT devices, network devices and the cloud
    layers. The extracted logs are hashed using a SHA-256 hash function and the hashed
    values are written onto the block as a transaction. We chose to hash the logs
    because these logs may contain sensitive information. Therefore, it is not advisable
    to store the logs as plaintext. Secondly, hashing the logs reduces its size which
    eventually reduces the time needed to process the logs.

    component of the model makes it possible for forensic investigators to verify
    the authenticity of logs presented to them by service providers. Additionally,
    forensic investigators can verify the authenticity of logs even as they are passed
    on from one investigator to another during the chain of custody. Furthermore,
    the court can also verify the authenticity of logs presented by prosecutors and
    decide if such a piece of evidence (log) must be admitted or not. This prevents
    investigators from tampering with logs to either incriminate innocent people or
    to exonerate criminals.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike the traditional digital forensics, investigators solely depend on the
    CSPs, network and the IoT devices for evidence when it comes to the IoT forensics.
    This dependence on CSPs may lead to compromising pieces of evidence. Our proposed
    model does not only ensure the integrity of logs through the use of a decentralized
    ledger but also allows logs tendered in as evidence to be verified by various
    stakeholders in the forensic process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our proposed model, the forensic investigator still falls on the CSP and
    IoT devices for the evidence. However, the evidence which in this case is the
    various logs generated by the cloud instances, network and the IoT devices are
    hashed after a forensic investigator receives such evidence from a CSP. The hashed
    value is then compared to the hashes stored as transaction values on the blockchain
    network. The investigator then searches for the hashed value on the blockchain
    network. If the hash value exists on the blockchain then the log is accepted by
    the investigator and forwarded to the court as credible evidence. On the other
    hand, if the hash value does not exist on the blockchain network then the log
    is rejected. When the court receives a log from a forensic investigator, the court
    can determine the credibility of the log by similarly hashing the log and comparing
    the hashed value to the hash values on the blockchain network. If the value exists,
    the evidence is accepted by the court. Otherwise, it is rejected. The verification
    process of our propose model is shown in Figure 2.

- en: For example, Bob who is a forensic investigator receives logs from a CSP intending
    to present the evidence to a court to prosecute an attacker called Elvan. However,
    Bob is not sure if the logs provided by the CSP has been tampered with or not.
    Since the hash of all logs is processed and stored in our blockchain-based model;
    Bob can verify the authenticity of the logs. Bob first runs the log through a
    SHA-256 hash function and gets a value (x). He then searches for the transaction
    (x) on the blockchain network. Bob is one of the participating nodes on the network.
    If he finds the value (x) as a valid transaction on the network; then the log
    is genuine and he can then proceed to court and present the log as a piece of
    evidence. However, if the value (x) is not a valid transaction then Bob must discard
    that log and rather investigate who made changes to the log. After Bob is presenting
    the log to the court, the court can also verify the authenticity of the log. The
    assumption here is that Bob might try to implicate Elvan as the perpetrator of
    a crime he is innocent of. Similarly, the court runs the log through a SHA-256
    hash function and then search for the exact value on the blockchain network. If
    the transaction value exists, then the court admits the log as evidence and proceeds
    with hearing the case. Otherwise, the court rejects the evidence and dismisses
    the case.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, our proposed model is based on blockchain, making the model a fully
    decentralized one as compared to a centralized approach discussed in (Meffert
    et al., 2017). The decentralized characteristic of our model ensures that logs
    can be verified to determine their authenticity or otherwise. It also prevents
    service providers and forensic investigators from tampering with logs without
    being detected. Our model uses the immutability property of blockchain as a leverage
    to ensure the integrity of logs produced in the IoT environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the possibility for the forensic stakeholders to verify the authenticity of the
    logs produced in IoT environments - an advantage that is either not available
    or not fully explored in the existing related work (Nieto et al., 2018; Nieto

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, IoT has become an integral part of human life. It is integrated into
    domains such as healthcare, automobile, agriculture, manufacturing industry and
    household. The world is going to see greater growth in IoT technology with the
    introduction of 5G network. However, just like any computing technology security
    of this technology is a concern. With an exponential increase in the number of
    cyber-attacks, it is important that such crimes are investigated and that the
    perpetrators are brought to justice. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the IoT
    environment coupled with the integration of the cloud and the network layer, forensic
    investigations in an IoT environment is a very challenging task. Further, it is
    extremely difficult for the stakeholders to determine the authenticity of the
    evidence they deal with, since in most cases they have to depend on service providers
    for these pieces of evidence. To ensure that logs presented to forensic investigators
    are authentic and tamper-free, we proposed a blockchain forensic model that uses
    a decentralized approach to keep the hashed values of logs produced in IoT environment
    as transactional records. The proposed model allows any forensic stakeholder to
    verify the authenticity of the logs they are working with. This model ensures
    that innocent people are not framed up and culprits are not exonerated by interested
    parties during a forensic investigation. For future work, we seek to perform an
    experimental validation to ascertain the computational impact our model will have
    in an IoT environment. Additionally, exploring ways of storing logs within our
    model is another area that is of interest to us.
