    by *Whitefield Diffie* and *Martin E. Hellman*. It suggested a method that consists
    of two keys: one for encrypting a message that is public and can be shared with
    others, and another for decrypting the message that is private and held securely
    by the owner of the key. The paper also proposed the concept of digital signature.
    It says that like physical signatures, digital signatures will be attached to
    the document, which could be created by the owner of the signature and also be
    verified by anyone for both content and the person who signed it.'

    learn about later. This came to be called *Merkle Tree root*. It helps Bitcoin

    This was probably the last missing piece that Satoshi needed to create Bitcoin.
    Earlier, proof –of work could be used to generate a token, which can help perform
    a single transaction. RPOW allowed the receiver of the token to regenerate a new
    token, which it can send to the next person, and so on. This way, the token generated
    by proof –of work works like a currency. RPOW uses Hashcash as a proof –of work
    token. The receiver of the Hashcash token generates RSA signed token called RPOW
    token in exchange for the Hashcash token, which it sends to the next receiver
    and repeats the process to move it further.

    On 27^(th) November 2010^, Slushpool launched the first mining pool in which miners
    would jointly mine a block, and once mined, the reward would be shared among miners
    based on their contribution. Later, mining pools became the only viable way to
    mine a block, and few mining pools almost completely took over the computational
    power of the network. Even today, this is the case. In July 2014, a mining pool
    briefly acquired more than 50% mining power of the network. The mining pool did
    not try to do a 51% mining attack, but it realized that this could affect the
    overall creditability of the network and committed to never crossing 40% of the

    adding the transaction to the block by the proof –of work algorithm. Instead,
    they verify all the consensus rules, smart contract clauses, time sequence of
    blocks, sending of bitcoin from sender to receiver, and funding of bitcoin from
    the previous transaction.'

    regulates bitcoin and incentivizes its use, Bitcoin addresses become more transparent
    and easier to track, but when government penalizes its users, Bitcoin addresses
    become opaque and more difficult to track. This makes Bitcoin censorship-resistant.

    anywhere in the world, its value in every currency is nearly the same. In some

    currency control on local currency, bitcoin value can be a bit higher than the

    is linked with criminals or hackers, exchanges may block such addresses, and it
    can affect the value of that bitcoin in the next transaction. But in a later transaction,
    if it is mixed with other bitcoin, then it becomes indistinguishable from any
    other coin. Since bitcoin is almost never distinguishable, it makes them quite
    fungible.
