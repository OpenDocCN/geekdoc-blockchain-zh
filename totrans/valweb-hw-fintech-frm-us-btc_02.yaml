    The mobile network is growing rapidly, with almost every country now seeing adoption
    by virtually their whole population. According to statistics from July 2015, more
    than half of the people living on earth today are using a mobile phone to connect
    and communicate. That is 3.73 billion individuals of the 7.36 billion living on
    earth. You may see other figures, such as mobile subscriptions exceed the world’s
    population—there are over 7.5 billion mobile subscriptions—but this relates to
    the fact that some individuals have two or three mobile accounts for their phone
    and tablet computers.

    only one in five people were on the mobile network; today, it’s one in two; tomorrow,
    it will be nearly everyone; and, as each person joins the network, things change.
    This is because there’s a network effect. The network effect has been known since
    the telephone was first invented, and it means that as each device is added to
    the network, the connections are multiplied. Therefore, 1 phone = 1 connection;
    2 phones = 2 connections. But once you add a third, the network effect kicks in
    as there are now multiple communication links.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This network effect snowballs over time, so that each new connection adds greater
    and greater connectivity, adding greater and greater value. In other words, the
    network effect sees an increase in the value of goods and services as the number
    of users multiplies. This network effect was first cited in 1908 by Bell Telephone,
    but the mobile internet has amplified this effect massively. In fact, it leads
    us to network economics. Network economics leverages the network effect to create
    trade and commerce, and is the reason why we see mobile social as a critical marketplace
    today.

    a marketplace or financial activity, because an incumbent bank’s systems and structures
    are usually too rigid, old and inflexible to change. That is why the new entrant
    simplifier can create P2P credit at less than 100 basis points differential (one
    percent difference between their lending and savings rates) compared to a bank’s
    400 basis points or more. A bank has to cover the costs of their premises, people
    and infrastructure. A start-up has none of that legacy or overhead.

    Another key point is that it uses the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to authenticate
    purchases. Using the iPhone’s camera means that users can take a picture of their
    bank card, and the details are automatically added to the Apple Pay service. Once
    the mobile device is set up, users can then make payments in any compatible retailer
    simply by tapping their phone and pressing their finger on the Touch ID sensor.

    the need for me to register my card or prepay details in other apps. Why do I
    have to load payment information in the Starbucks app, and then again in the Uber
    app, and then again in the eBay app, and then again in the Airbnb app? We need
    one app to unite them all, and I think Apple Pay is that app. Apple Pay aggregates

    is tied to the smartphone and soon has crossed over to a watch. The watch uses

    also factored in voice recognition biometrics and more. Therefore, as you walk

    layer of consumer identification based upon the device and an additional recognition
    layer, i.e., your fingerprint. This method is therefore based upon a Consumer
    Device Cardholder Verification Method (CDCVM) rather than no verification. This

    WeBank first in January 2015, and focuses upon microlending due to the restrictions
    placed upon its bank licence by the regulators. For example, they cannot open
    branches and are unable to take deposits. After all, they don’t want these banks
    competing head-to-head with the large, state-owned banks; this is why the new,
