- en: Blockchain technology is one of the latest innovations in computer science that
    has world-wide scale and reach. A blockchain is a mathematical structure for storing
    digital transactions in a distributed and decentralized digital ledger consisting
    of multiple blocks that are linked using cryptographic signatures and spread across
    multiple computers. Each block records digital transactions data securely and
    has a hash link pointing to the previous block in the network in an efficient
    manner. New blocks can be added and removed through an agreed consensus of all
    nodes that each share the distributed ledger without the need for a centralized
    controlling authority. This chapter aims to introduce the blockchain technology,
    also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), and discuss its applications
    in various sectors of the society including banking, healthcare, transportation,
    manufacturing, supply chain, and education. Extension of the internet of things
    vision using the DLT is also briefly discussed.

- en: Blockchain Technology is one of the newest innovations in the field of computer
    science, that has world-wide scale and reach. Blockchain has long been associated
    with cryptocurrency e.g. Bitcoin. However, this emerging technology is destined
    to disrupt the global economy in the foreseeable future. It has a huge potential
    to positively impact on the various industries including healthcare, transportation,
    manufacturing, finance, automotive, education, and government. The World Economic
    Forum estimates that by 2025, at least 10% of the world’s GDP, currently at USD
    100 trillion, will be managed via the Blockchain technology (Hance, 2020).

    in 2008\. This was essentially the realisation that the technology that underlined
    the operation of ‘Bitcoin’ could be separated from the currency and used for all
    kinds of other interorganisational cooperation. There was, then, further exponential
    development over the period of about 10 years in terms of ‘smart contracts’, ‘proofs
    of work’, and Blockchain ‘scaling’. Since its origin in 2008, The Blockchain technology
    has gone through a number of phases but most notably by the three as follows (Goyal,

- en: A Blockchain is a distributed database spread across many computers with no
    central control, that can transform governance, business models and the functioning
    of organisations. A Blockchain is a perfect place to store information on digital
    assets (representing values, identities, agreements, property rights, credentials,
    etc). It promises a more efficient, secure and transparent way of handling transactions,
    that can save a huge amount of administration, bureaucracy, effort and time.

- en: According to McKinsey in Garson (2018), Blockchain can be described as a decentralised,
    shared and trusted distributed ledger (or database) that consists of encrypted
    ‘blocks’ of information added to a chain of existing blocks of records. The ledger
    relies on the consensus of a global peer network to operate. Modifying the data
    in one block is impossible without modifying the entire chain and without an agreed
    consensus of the entire peer network. Before a new block is added, it must first
    be validated by other participants (i.e. other blocks, also called nodes) to prevent
    fraud and to preserve security. Blocks are immutable so once data in a block is
    added to the chain, it cannot be edited; unless the Blockchain is initially created
    with ability to edit blocks, which is something that is subject to consensus (Robinson,
    2018). Blockchain allows information to be verified and exchanged without relying
    on a third-party central or management authority. The Blockchain technology is
    based on a complex branch of mathematics called cryptography.

    the industry go far beyond the financial transactions using cryptocurrencies such
    as Bitcoin. With the ability of Blockchain to provide more transparency and robustness,
    and with its characteristics such as immutability, this technology is impacting
    a wide variety of industries including finance, manufacturing, supply chain, logistics,
    and healthcare, to name a few. Some of the Blockchain applications in the said
    industries, and more, are now elaborated in the following sub-sections.

    people and allow them all kinds of opportunities relating to trade and commerce.
    In this context, Blockchain provides a tool that can accomplish the same but on
    a wider scale, more securely and transparently. Therefore, Blockchain technology
    has a potential for global commerce. It can make trade more efficient by removing
    the manual and paper-based processes, and introducing streamlined and automated
    processes instead. A public Blockchain can be a great collaborative tool because
    it is decentralized. Besides, there is no human intervention in its operation.
    The following bullet points briefly discuss a number of use cases of the Blockchain
    technology in the banking sector (Concise Software, 2020; Shumsky, 2019).

    part of addressing the challenges of system interoperability and accessibility
    of medical records. Blockchain can help to resolve the issues by accessing and

    traceability, and transparency are the top three drivers behind the industry’s
    investment in Blockchain. Mire (2018) lists ten use cases in manufacturing where
    Blockchain technology can be usefully employed including supply chain management,
    3-D printing, reducing systematic failures, improving trust in products, authentication
    of IoT based devices, and better tracking and maintenance. Some of these are briefly

    more complex as businesses continues to globalize. Lack of skills in the sector
    is also becoming more obvious, and supply chains are becoming increasingly more
    expensive. It is in this context that Blockchain solutions can result in simplification
    of SC management to help maintain production levels and improve efficiency. As
    an example, businesses can develop systems by which all participants on a supply
    chain can refer to and update a single record for all to see. These systems can
    then allow manufacturers to reduce product loss, provide a measure of provenance
    to those who they pass the finished products to, and also to play a major role
    in regulatory compliance. Forbes in Columbus (2019) predict that the most investment
    in Blockchain will be in its adoption for the following five areas: digital market
    places, tracking supply chain parameters, tracking product quality, preventing
    counterfeits, tracking asset maintenance. Blockchain application in SC is further

    the previous 12 months; and 38% of them reported losing up to $10 million because
    of such breeches (Mire, 2018). One characteristic of the Blockchain is that it
    requires the consensus of all nodes in the chain to approve data entry or changes
    to the ledger; this is part of Blockchain security mechanism. Because manufacturing
    requires near-constant communication between suppliers, and a single data breach
    can easily compromise the operations of each party, appropriate level of security

    not be made party to such information. In this context, the Blockchain decentralized
    technology can allow this information to be shared, but not compromised or changed.
    Also, the information about supply chain provenance can be accessed fairly quickly.

    interest. Some of the features of the Blockchain technology that SCM find attractive
    include consensus, provenance, immutability, trust, and finality (Morley, 2020).
    These features result in the following benefits for a more efficient SCM:'

    students can access materials and work on innovative projects. Digital tokens

    credentials. If data is stored on a public Blockchain, it is stored on every node
    on the network (of institutions and educational bodies). If one node is compromised,
    the ledger would remain unaffected. Additionally, if any data were tampered with,
    this would affect the cryptographic hashing of the block, thus breaking the chain
    between the blocks. In this case, the breach would be broadcast to the entire
    network, and the compromised block would be rejected. This provides security and

- en: Blockchain technology and robotic process automation are increasingly the focus
    of attention in research, as these are both used successfully in business, marketing,
    manufacturing, and finance. However, their application in educational contexts
    is still emerging. This chapter uses an illustrative example of an online school
    registration system to explore how a blockchain-based robotic process automation
    mechanism can resolve the inherent challenges. The proposed system allows parents
    to register their Grade 1 and Grade 8 children for their school of choice. There
    is competition for places in certain schools and a history of unfair allocation
    of educational resources; hence, there is mistrust. To counter this threat, this
    study proposes a blockchain-based robotic automation process mechanism to fairly
    and transparently allocate educational resources. It recommends that further design
    science research be conducted in which the blockchain is supplemented by additional
    technological processes to enhance data-sharing in educational settings.

- en: This chapter explores the Online School Registration System for a regional group
    of South African schools as an illustrative example. This is an official online
    application system that is used by parents to register their Grade 1 and Grade
    8 children in South African schools for the following academic year. This system
    is part of a citizen facing e-government system as it is operated by the state
    and meets the definition of e-government as given by Silcock (2001).

    (ICT), which may include wide area networks, systems, the Internet, Internet of
    Things and mobile computing, to enhance the access to and delivery of government
    services to benefit citizens, business partners, and employees (Silcock, 2001).
    This facilitates a new mode of public service where government agencies have an
    opportunity to deliver a technologically advanced, integrated and seamless service
    for their citizens (Bakon, Elias & Abusamhadana, 2020; Silcock, 2001). However,
    as Bélanger and Carter (2008) have established, mutual trust hinders citizen adoption
    of e-government services. Their study concludes that government agencies should
    directly address citizens' views concerning the credibility and trustworthiness
    of e-government systems, to increase citizens' perceptions of their value, accuracy
    and reliability. Through improved transparency and accountability, the trust needed
    by its citizens to adopt e-services can be further strengthened (Bélanger & Carter,
    2008).

    Registration System in South Africa. The competition for places in certain public
    schools is emotionally charged and has serious individual and social consequences.
    The distrust often arises from negative reports carried by newspapers and other
    media combined with the history of unfair allocation of educational resources
    in the context in which the system operates (Mokhaoli, 2020). This has compromised
    the issues of trust based on the perceived transparency and integrity of the Online
    School Registration System. These issues remain important even when, as is the
    case in the current chapter, the focus of the research reported is specifically
    on technology solutions. Future research will look at the Online School Registration
    System from other e-government perspectives.

    the Online School Registration System (OSRS) does not use Internet of Things or

- en: As part of the process, copies of certified documents, such as a birth certificate,
    identification document, school report cards from previous grades, and proof of
    residence, must be attached. The system also requires parents to ‘take a picture
    of the registration process’ as proof of registration and to submit hard copies
    of the documents submitted to the school on the same day (Gauteng Province, 2020).
    This additional process (that appears on left of Figure 1) may be intended to
    verify information provided and hence to lessen deliberate submission of misinformation
    and to check that online data has not been tampered with (Arslan, Jurdak, Jelitto
    & Krishnamachari, 2019). Parents can use a variety of devices to access the system
    (cellphones, laptops, desktop computer; as shown at the top part of Figure 1).
    The system has an intensive period of data input (with a fixed start and end times).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite the fact that parents have used the online system, they also need to
    submit hard copies of documents and present proof of registration to the chosen
    school (as shown at left of Figure 1). This ‘backup system’ helps the parents
    to prove any allegations that their online applications got lost, misplaced, were
    never received by schools or that their children have been unfairly placed in
    a school that is far from home. However, retaining the manual process causes duplication
    of effort and duplicate data that needs to be reconciled in the case of a dispute,
    and the dispute resolution process may still be prone to human failings including
    bias resulting once again in inappropriate or unfair placement of the learner.
    Therefore, trust issues remain valid when there is conflicting information and
    the double system results in an increase in the manual administration burden.
    In fact, many of the limitations of a manual system that the automated system
    seeks to address are simply magnified where two parallel systems are used.

    e-government systems bring both opportunities and challenges. The security and
    privacy during transmission and storage of data is a major challenge. Figure 2

    of Things (Lohachab, Lohachab & Jangra, 2020), but almost all of the challenges

    agreement that the broad success of virtual environments depends on the trust
    of the general public (Tan & Thoen, 2001). Trust consists of two elements: party
    providing the service (party trust), and control trust, which is the mechanism
    in which the service is provided (Bélanger & Carter, 2008). Tan and Thoen (2001)
    define control mechanism as dedicated procedures and protocols that ensure that
    the transaction is performed successfully through monitoring and control. Trust
    is defined as expectation that an individual or group can be relied upon their
    promise. According to the social learning theory, people develop different expectancies
    due to their experiences of promised negative or positive reinforcements. In the
    given scenario, some parents'' applications go through as expected while others
    might experience difficulties as explained in the introduction. This chapter proposes
    that Blockchain technology, as suggested by Xing and Marwala (2018), can provide
    assistence in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in ascertaining trust by changing
    the way online transactions are generally performed and ensure success (Makridakis
    Polemitis, Giaglis & Louca, 2018).'

- en: The first part of the proposed solution put forward in this chapter is based
    on a claim that RPA can close the gap in terms of the security and privacy during
    transmission and storage of data to some extent, and that in addition, school
    administration efficiency and the fairness of the registration process can be
    improved. RPA is applied to human rule-based tasks that are repetitive and manual.
    For example, historically RPA has been used in industrial engineering processes
    to progressively automate tasks aimed at achieving economic efficiencies and improved
    product quality (Moffitt, Rozario & Vasarhelyi, 2018). RPA, also known as robots
    or bots, involves software agents that mimic user actions aimed at increasing
    operational efficiency to alleviate the workload of the human workforce (Syed
    et al., 2020). It is important to note that these are not the hardware robots
    that we are familiar with.

    creation, software installations, data migration, and vendor on-boarding (Madakam,

- en: The second part of the proposed solution involves Blockchain technology, as
    the need to transmit confidential information accurately, reliably and securely
    between the parents, the Online School Registration System and the schools persists.
    As noted earlier, trust is a major factor that the system is grappling with as
    the parents do not trust that it is fair and transparent (that is, that it will
    place their children at the appropriate school based on language and location
    - proximity to school). A Blockchain creates an immutable record of interactions
    as all those interactions go through the Blockchain. This approach ensures that
    the quality of data is complete, correct, persist and retrievable (Reyna, Martín,
    Chen, Soler & Díaz, 2018).

- en: Artificial intelligence (AI) embodied as robots or bots (terms used interchangeably
    with RPA) has the capability to perform complex, hard, dangerous, data-intensive
    tasks such as monitoring cybersecurity threats or boring tasks for humans. AI
    is everywhere and affects everyone in all aspects of our lives in the form of
    service, transportation, military robots and so on. AI robots can make decisions
    and act without human control (Dignum, 2017). In Blockchain-based RPA, the process
    of registration can be automated effectively and reliably using robots (bots).
    A Blockchain can ensure that records are not changed, history is retained, and
    transparency is maintained, thereby building trustworthy data-sharing (of personal
    data) (Shahaab, Hewage & Khan, 2020), as well as efficient and effective registration.
    Transparency, validation (including by home affairs departments if there are issues
    regarding birth certificates, etc.), traceability and immutability of the learners’
    registration records sent to the Online School Registration System and subsequently
    to the school concerned, are all improved. Traceability shows the status of a
    transaction including when it was received at a point in the process (workflow).
    This is particularly useful in a system which is distributed (the client does
    not visit an office and several different parties – in this case, the school and
    the centralized registration authority) are in different places. Blockchain supposed
    to safely store/transmit trustworthy data; AI on the other hand can ensure that
    this data is sent and received without human intervention making it even trustworthy
    to transact on the online systems. This combination makes Blockchain and AI a
    natural fit to handle complex tasks of safely storing/transmitting data (Makridakis
    et. al., 2018).

- en: A Blockchain consists of ordered and grouped transactions in blocks sharing
    the same timestamp. The blocks are managed by networks of miners or nodes (participants)
    that link the blocks. As this makes it difficult to change the records, a robust
    and auditable registry of all transactions is created even though the records
    are widely shared (Casino et al., 2019). In the Online School Registration System,
    there are issues at stake which may tempt parents, school administrators or independent
    dishonest people such as hackers to cheat the system, sometimes for financial
    reward. As registration systems cover all schools and learners throughout the
    country, manual systems are difficult to monitor and control. Rules relating to
    registration are complex; for example, if an older sibling is at the school subsequent
    siblings get entry automatically (as they are first in line). The Blockchain-based
    RPA mechanism can ensure that these rules are applied correctly. Blockchain has
    the ability to automate the validation of credentials using encryption technology
    and to provide access to a shared database, transactions, records, and logs in
    a decentralized, secure, transparent and trusted manner. While AI in the form
    of RPA (robots or bots) offers decision-making capabilities that mimic human intelligence,
    combination of these two technologies can provide massive benefits to the citizens
    (Salah, Rehman, Nizamudddin, & AI-Fuquaha, 2018).

    year 2020), to register online. However, the volume of data collected into the
    Online School Registration System during that period is massive, making it a challenging
    task to integrate it, process it, and to base decisions on it quickly. Additionally,
    some parents show signs of frustration and complain that the system is inconvenient
    and unreliable, because even though they applied online and on time, their children
    were still not placed. As a result of these challenges, the associated education
    authority had to extend the registration period in 2020 (The Citizen, 2020). However,
    advancements in technology can change and improve lives. It has brought extremely
    small electronic devices with a large amount of computing power, storage, and
    battery capacities and with capabilities allowing identification, communication
    and interconnection. With this technology, it is possible to analyse and process
    massive amounts of information (Chen, 2012). Hence the three required characteristics
    as noted in Table 2 can be satisfied by new-generation technology. Rejeb, Keogh

    and carries out a series of actions automaticlly, that can be at times complex
    and intelligent. For example, Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong
    Kong-based company Hanson Robotics using artificial intelligence software which
    can process virtual and emotional data. It can display more than 50 facial expression,
    and use this information to converse and create relationships with people. Swarm
    robotics, inspired by social insects, uses coordination techniques to control
    large numbers of relatively simple robots. In this context, the bots are assumed
    to possess the following important characteristics: (i) the bots are partially
    independent agents; (ii) the bots have limited representation, that is, they do
    not understand the whole system; and (iii) none of the bots manage the whole system,
    and so decentralisation is maintained (Zikratov, Lebedev, Gurtov & Kuzmich 2014).
    Swarm of bots can detect and trust their counterparts, where a public key cryptography
    technology allows any bot that wants to communicate and send information to a
    specific bot address, with the information that only the bot has a matching key
    to read the record. Even if the public key falls into the wrong hands, there is
    no risk since it is not used to decrypt the record (Ferrer, 2019). In addition,
    a permanent record that is auditable and can be used to coordinate an action,
    verify credentials stored in a synchronised copy of the Blockchain in a peer-to-peer
    version to ensure that they all share the same public database (Ferrer, 2019).
    Evolutionary robotics is an emerging technique, inspired by the Darwinian principle
    of selective reproduction of the fittest for the automatic creation of autonomous
    robots that develop their own skills in close interaction with the environment
    with little or no human intervention. Ambient robotics has the technical capability
    to reduce the complexity and the cost of service robotic system by focusing on
    the co-adaptation and the creation of compatibility in a physical and providing
    informational sense of assistive environments (Moore, 2016). RPA is a software-based
    solution and not a physical robot as already established above.'

    (Lacity & Willcocks, 2016). However, the managers using such software or automation
    are facing resistance as there is a risk that certain human jobs will become redundant.
    The advantage of automation is that the burden of repetitive, monotonous, and
    simple humans tasks is reduced or even eliminated so that the human workforce
    can focus on unstructured, intellectual, creative and interesting tasks; the efficiency
    of day-to-day processing is also increased (Lacity & Willcocks, 2016; Uskenbayeva,
    Kalpeyeva, Satybaldiyeva, et al., 2019). Hence, companies are adopting fast-emerging

    human-computer interaction layer using rule-based and non-subjective processes
    in a manner that simulates human-machine interaction behaviour without changing
    the existing business processes or information communication and Technology (ICT)
    infrastructure. Vendors such as AutomationEdge, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism,
    Cognizant, Conduent, Kofax, Kryon Systems, Pegasystems, Softomotive, and UiPath
    implement and offer RPA tools (van der Aalst, Bichler & Heinzl, 2018). In the
    study conducted by Lacity and Willcocks (2016), RPA was found to be mostly used
    in validating the sale of insurance premiums, generating utility bills, paying
    health care insurance claims, keeping employee records up-to-date, and generating
    news stories. This same review established that companies who implemented the
    RPA, were able to see immediate tangible benefits when they adopted three strategies.
    Firstly, have top management support for the implementation of automation; secondly,
    implement automated processes that deliver value to both customers and employees;
    and thirdly, build skills and capabilities that are enterprise wide. If implemented
    well, these authors say that the return on investment can be achieved within 9-12
    months as the deployment is quick and cost effective with the quality of work
    guaranteed (Lacity and Willcocks, 2016). The return on investment can be achieved
    through this digital labour as it will reduce costs and free up human resources
    who would then focus more on important tasks and for robots to perform large number

    transparent append-only register of all the transactions shared by participating
    members in the network. Each transaction contains details of who sent it, what
    was sent, at what time and to whom; transactions are then grouped into blocks
    in a chronological order (Reyna et al., 2018). The chain is formed by linking
    blocks together using a hash function, which forms a unique identifier, and this
    is used to create the link to the previous block. Each block uses a cryptographic
    technique to validate data linked to that block through proof of work, hash function,
    digital signature, and encryption mechanisms (Dubovitskaya, Novotny, Xu & Wang,
    2019). The identity of the participants (also called nodes in the network) and
    their rights to participate are defined within a network. The consensus obtained
    from the members is represented digitally and allows each transaction to be recorded
    in the Blockchain. The distributed service of the database ensures that trustworthiness
    can be achieved by making the data available to all participants to verify that
    the data have not been tempered with since the first definition. This service
    also ensures that the data remains immutable (Reyna et al., 2018; Dubovitskaya
    et al., 2019). Once the transactions are recorded on the database they cannot
    be deleted or removed to keep the historical data. The basic characteristics of
    Blockchain are summarised in Table 4.

    known among the participants. This forms the backbone of cryptocurrency Bitcoin,

    sectors such as finance, accounting, management, and law could be revolutionised.
    Blockchain 1.0, which focused on digital currency, is the first Blockchain generation
    that uses an underlying technology platform such as mining, hashing, and the public
    ledger and transaction-enabling software for digital currency. Blockchain 2.0
    broadened the focus to the digital economy and is the second generation of Blockchain.
    It involves smart contracts which are computer programs that can automatically
    execute the terms of a contract. Payments are automatically processed after a
    pre-configured condition in a smart contract is met by participants. Blockchain
    3.0 extends the focus still further and its group of beneficiaries are digital
    society. Blockchain 3.0 refers to a variety of application areas such as art,
    health, science, identity, governance, education, public goods, and different
    aspects of culture and communication. It does not necessarily involve economic
    activity (money, currency, commerce or financial markets). The application of
    Blockchain 3.0 for digital society includes smart governance, smart mobility,
    smart living, the smart use of natural resources, smart citizens, and smart economy
    for smart cities. The use of peer-to-peer interaction on the Internet of Things
    platform to trade is based on the Blockchain technology and smart contracts. Similarly,

    applied by a few educational institutions to validate and share credentials and/or
    learning outcomes that the students have achieved. However, researchers envisaged
    that Blockchain technology can offer much more than validating and sharing credentials.
    It could also delimit the central role of educational institutions and disrupt
    institutional norms to empower its citizens with the opportunity to transact with
    trust (Alammary, Alhazmi, Almasri & Gillani, 2019). It is important to first understand
    the concept of Blockchain before understanding its relevance in education (Sharples
    & Domingue, 2016). Blockchain, which is a distributed record of digital events,
    can be described as the linked data of items stored in blocks on every participants''
    computer to make a long block of chain, where a majority of those participating
    in a network can allow the addition of the next item/transaction to be added in
    a new block by consensus. There are two types of Blockchains: public and private.
    In a public Blockchains, anyone can access and possibly add to it; in the private
    Blockchain which is restricted to participants within the network who are the
    only ones allowed to access and add to the Blockchain (Nakamoto, 2008; Sharples
    & Domingue, 2016).'

    achievements and credits, for example, degree certificate and performance profiles.
    Blockchain in education provides a platform for persistent and secure public records
    where certificates and badges can be directly awarded to a student by trusted
    institutions, experts and teachers. The student can also access their credentials
    to share with potential employers, etc. The Blockchain technology does not verify
    the trustworthiness of the parties, it merely provides public evidence that the
    mentioned student has been awarded a certificate from a certain institution. The
    Blockchain solves the issue of recording occurrence of events and reliable checking
    of awarding of a degree, which may expose the awarding institution if, for example,
    the certificate is not valid (Bartolomé Castañeda, Torlà & Adell, 2017; Sharples
    & Domingue, 2016). In this way, Blockchain can introduce trust, transparency and
    efficiency, and create secure and connected networks of educational institutions,
    educational technology companies, and citizens to enable secure sharing and trusted
    exchange of data. To mitigate any issues and at the same time benefit from the
    Blockchain in terms of decentralise architecture, security offerings, anonymity,
    immutability, integrity and transparency are the attractive characteristics. Turkanović,
    Hölbl, M. and Košič (2018) proposed a system called EduCTX that can be globally
    trusted in higher education credit and grading systems. Their contribution was
    specifically related to the higher education credit system to provide a distributed
    and interoperable architecture model for higher education in order for students
    and institutions to have a unified viewpoint. Here, students can access a complete
    history of their course in a single and transparent view, and for universities
    to access student''s educational records despite its origins. This benefit can
    also be extended to the potential employers which can use the system to validate
    students’ credentials after their permission is received. For example, Grech and
    Camilleri (2017) predicted and described certain areas in educational sector that

    problems faced by the online registration system (Fenwick & Vermeulen, 2019).

    Documents such as birth certificate, identification, school report cards from

    interference, the proposed new online registration system seeks to benefit from
    a Blockchain-based RPA mechanism. The Blockchain technology allows for the identification
    of participants and verification of participants’ attributes by various authorities
    and a verification of the registration application to the Blockchain.

    Internet of Things infrastructure technology such as a bar code reader or a QR
    code reader (available as an App on a smart phone or any other device with a camera)
    to identify the parents and their child(ren). In other words, the user cannot
    manually type in the ID number into the system, instead, they must use a QR or
    bar code reader. This sensor will read the code and automatically enter the ID
    number and associated name, surname and street address into the system. In this
    way, the first block, Block#01 in Figure 4, will be created. The encrypted private
    key identifier is the ID number of the parent and child(ren), hash (randomly generated
    numbers in each scan) and timestamp. The ID number of a parent can never change
    without authorization (possibly if a child has a new guardian), and that of a
    child can also never change while they are under 18 years of age. The Department
    of Home Affairs is the only authority to issue valid ID documents in South Africa.
    Other details, such as residential address will of course need to be updated and
    verified (see the next activity).

- en: Following a successful identification, it is proposed that transactions are
    stored sequentially in blocks of chains and in chronological order. The next Block#02
    in Figure 4 then matches the residential address to identify the nearest school.
    The bot ‘owned by’ the local municipality receives the file with the public key
    in the form of digital signature cryptography and decrypts it to access the record.
    The bot then logs into the local municipality system and retrieves the record
    utility bill record to confirm the street address using the ID number from Block#01
    in Figure 4\. If there is a match and the street address is confirmed, the bot
    creates a transaction with a private key consisting of the ID number of the parent
    and child(ren), hash from Block#01, street number and timestamp. Once the record
    is created, the bot sends the file with the public key to the Department of Basic
    Education to confirm the child’s school records. If there is no match, an invalid
    message is sent to the parent. The bot at the node of the Department of Basic
    Education network receives the file in the form of digital signature cryptography
    and decrypts the public key to open the file. It will use the ID number from Block#02
    (Figure 4) to access the child(ren)’s school records and to confirm if they have
    passed Grade 0 or Grade 7 to qualify for Grade 1 or Grade 8 respectively. The
    bot uses the address from Block#01 (Figure 4) to locate and check if there is
    space available at the nearest school using the street address of the applicant.
    If there is a space, the bot creates a record, say Block#03 as in Figure 4, with
    the private key containing ID number of the parent and child(ren), hash from Block#02
    (Figure 4), street number, school registered number and timestamp, and sends the
    file to the school. If the child(ren) do not qualify or previous school records
    are not found, a message “invalid record” is sent immediately to the parent and
    department for checking and correction. Once the previous step has been successfully
    completed, the bot sends the file with digital signature cryptography to the next
    node, which is the school. The bot at the school node end of the series of steps
    uses its own private key to decrypt the file and the check number of learners
    to be placed compared with the space available at the school. Note that this node
    does not need to be physically located at the school but rather indicates that
    this is the logical location. At times there are learners who do not take up allocated
    places but do not inform the registration system of this decision. Hence, the
    bot at the school node needs to confirm placement of the applying learner in terms
    of space availability by sending a message to the onsite school administrators,
    particularly once classes have started. If a space is available, the bot creates
    a record, say in Block#04 as in Figure 4, with the private key combination consisting
    of ID number of the parent and child(ren), hash from Block#03 (Figure 4), street
    number, school registered number, learner number and timestamp. The bot creates
    and sends the message “Learner successfully placed at the school” to the parent,
    department of education and the school.

    nodes. Placement of learners to a school takes place through an RPA after the
    steps in Blocks #01 to #03 (Figure 4) have been validated by all the nodes or
    participants in the intelligent network. The authorship is guaranteed by the fact
    that bots use their own private key to encrypt the file and other bots use the
    sender''s public key to decrypt the digital signature cryptography. The receiving
    bot uses the sender''s encrypted private key proves that it could not have been

- en: In the proposed solution as illustrated in Figure 4, only the first stage requires
    a human to initiate the registration process. Thereafter, the remaining steps
    are a combination of Blockchain and AI (bots) to complete the registration transaction.
    The proposed solution suggests the use of bots to detect and trust their counterparts,
    where public key cryptography technology provides any robot (that wants to communicate
    and send information to a specific robot addresses), with the information that
    only that bot has a matching key to read the record. Even if the public key falls
    into the wrong hands, there is no risk, since it is not used to decrypt the record.
    With this Blockchain technology, the bots can agree without the need for a controlling
    authority that the given record is credible. Once it is agreed, the block cannot
    be deleted or changed and is available to be certified by anyone on the network.
    After ensuring that all the new transactions that are supposed to be included
    in block#4 are valid, there is no need to invalidate previous credentials, for
    example, in block01# to block03#, as shown in Figure 4.

    the concept of a Blockchain-based RPA mechanism where educational credentials
    are decentralised for verification using robots, then this has to be defined in
    the policy in terms of the online registration system for Gauteng with standards
    and regulatory framework. The government should build expertise in order to understand
    and support the implementation of distributed database technology in the areas
    of storing sensitive, digital certificates, academic credentials and personal
    data using Blockchain-based RPA. |'

    who has received ‘work’ including when. Hence showing the status of an application
    (work flow) is very useful in a system which is distributed (the parents do not
    have to visit the schools and several different parties e.g. the home affairs,
    the centralised registration authority, etc) as they are in different places.
    Recording of decisions making process on the Blockchain ensures that parents,
    schools and government can trust, understand and trace the AI decisions. |'

    of education should further investigate and support a Blockchain-based RPA mechanism
    for the Online School Registration System using other use cases. Since the decisions
    of allocating educational resources will be shifted to the AI algorithms, there
    should be awareness and negotiations with the parents and schools regarding the
    introduction of a Blockchain-based RPA and its impact towards existing and planned

    of the Blockchain-based RPA is through a phased approach, for instance, starting

    RPA mechanism. |'

- en: '| Further Research | Since the department of education has to prove that the
    Blockchain could offer considerable value to the parents, schools and themselves,
    the illustrative example of a Blockchain-based RPA serves as a way to make the
    department aware regarding the social advantage and potential it could have in
    increasing efficiency and effectiveness of allocating educational resources, using
    this mechanism; thereby creating a trusted Online School Registration System.
    Although a Blockchain-based RPA has been illustrated that is able to automatically
    store data in distributed database, verify educational credentials, and establish
    consesus between swarm robots without a central authority, the department of education
    is advised to conduct further research through a pilot study. It is proposed that
    this pilot study should collaborate with parents, schools, private sector, employee
    unions, and government agencies to get a buy-in and to create a policy framework
    for a Blockchain-RPA mechanism in educational setting. It is important to note
    that there is a possibility that bots can generate incorrect results due to changing
    business rules, partly because bots are unable to adapt their behavour to the
    new business rules. In order to lessen these disruptions, research in control
    and monitor mechanisms is needed to proactively adapt the bots in detecting changing
    business rules. |'

- en: This chapter has presented some of the challenges faced by the Internet-based
    e-government systems which share characteristics with the Internet of Things.
    The chapter has suggested a Blockchain-based RPA mechanism as a possible solution
    for traceability, identification, validation and procession of registration without
    human intervention and a single central authority in control of placing learners
    at various school. Additionally, the chapter used an illustrative example from
    educational sector to demonstrate the Blockchain-based RPA mechanism in the registration
    process which includes cryptography, smart contracts, electronic school records,
    machine-to-machine communication (bots) and the implication of these within the
    Internet of Things scenario.

- en: The combination of Blockchain and RPA has been shown to provide the possibility
    of storing the objects and all their changes, allowing complete, open and reliable
    traceability in an educational setting. Reliable identification is important,
    hence traditionally hardcopies of important documents are confirmed by a commissioner
    of oath and always accompanied by ID document. However, Blockchain identification
    verification has shown to be able to provide an open, trusted distributed ledger
    that can be used to verify identities, not only with respect to finance, but also
    in educational settings.

    links, use consensus to significantly improve fairness and transparency using
    private and public keys in the process of placing a learner at a school through
    using Blockchain technology. This exploratory discussion was limited to a single
    example. Further research efforts should be made to ensure the security and privacy
    of educational records using more cases.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) has ushered in several emerging and disruptive
    technologies. Southern Africa’s records management practices have for a long time
    been reported to lag behind in embracing new technologies. Several studies have
    revealed lack of requisite skills to manage electronic records while others still
    lament the un-procedural management of paper records. The intention of this chapter
    is, therefore, to initiate a discourse that challenges information management
    practitioners to embrace disruptive technologies lest they themselves get disrupted.
    There are several emerging technologies, but this chapter focuses on blockchain
    technology and its possible benefits for records management. Guided by the technology
    acceptance model, the study established that archivists and records managers in
    Botswana and Zimbabwe would adopt blockchain if it is easy to use and useful for
    records management. The chapter ends by proposing a model for the adoption of
    blockchain technology for records management.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The adoption of new technologies is a fairly documented phenomenon. The use
    of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in developed countries proliferated
    between the 1980s and 1990s. The same, however, cannot be said for countries in
    Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) as they were left trailing behind, hence creating a global
    digital divide (Wamboye et al., 2015). By 2011, more than half of the global population
    used a mobile phone with 13% having access to the Internet (ITU, 2018). Although
    this shows growth in the adoption of ICTs, the SSA region still falls behind other
    regions regarding the implementation of ICTs. This chapter focuses on two Sub
    Saharan countries namely Botswana and Zimbabwe. Both countries have a strong ICT
    framework supported by national policy (ITU, 2018). ICTs facilitate relatively
    easy information capture, processing, storage, and sharing (Burke, 1992). In turn,
    this leads to the generation of huge volumes of digital, electronic as well as
    paper records, hence the need to adopt emerging technologies so as to better manage
    the large volumes of records.

    are implementing records management systems with a view of improving service delivery.
    However, adoption and use of these systems have been found wanting. This has also
    been observed by Mnjama and Wamukoya (2007) who indicated that managing records
    generated by ICTs have been a major challenge for archivists and records managers
    in the public sector in Africa. At national level, both Botswana and Zimbabwe
    have adopted electronic records management systems. Mosweu (2014) and Mosweu et
    al. (2017) have investigated factors that affected the adoption and use of an
    EDRMS at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance
    and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model as framework. Mosweu (2014) has reported the
    findings of a pilot study from an ongoing study whose findings revealed the adoption
    and use of an EDRMS was affected by computer attitudes, computer anxiety, social
    influences, facilitating conditions and performance expectancy. The eventual findings
    of the study as reported in Mosweu et al. (2017) showed that the four major UTAUT
    constructs accounted for 55% of the variance in explaining behavioral intention
    to adopt and use the EDRMS named the Document Workflow Management System. Empirical
    data indicated that key factors that affected to the low adoption and use of the
    system were technophobia, negative attitudes to system use, perceived system complexity
    and incompatibility with existing information systems as key factors contributing
    to low adoption and usage of the system.'

    of a Court Records Management System (CRMS) improved the delivery of justice in
    the Gaborone Magistrate District. The Motsaathebe and Mnjama (2007) studied the
    automation of records management processes in the High Courts of Botswana. The
    two preceding studies revealed that the implementation in both the High Courts
    and Gaborone Magistrate District improved case management and delivery as among
    others instances of missing files needed to argue cases were reduced significantly,
    file retrieval became easier and cases were successfully captured into the system.
    In yet another study, Moatlhodi and Kalusopa (2016) investigated the e-records
    readiness at the Ministry of Labour and Home Affairs and found that opportunities
    for increasing the depth of e-records readiness existed as system implementation
    funds were available and the ICT infrastructure was adequate, while management
    commitment was guaranteed. The studies by Kalusopa and Ngulube (2012), and Moloi
    and Mutula (2007) focused on e-records readiness among labour organisations and
    e-records readiness in an e-government setting respectively. The study by Kalusopa
    and Ngulube (2012) established that e-records readiness in labour organizations
    in Botswana was evident, low and evolving. The evidence for that was shown by
    the slow adoption of ICTs, inadequate records management standards and practices,
    and low integration in the national e-readiness framework. Shonhe and Grand (2019)
    investigated change management in EDRMS implementation at the Tlokweng Land Board
    (TLB). Communication came out as the most effective tool for managing change at
    TLB. However, due to lack of capacity in effecting change management, the desired
    change was yet to be reinforced. Rakemane and Serema (2018) investigated electronic
    records management practices at the Companies and the Intellectual Property Authority
    and found that ICTs are widely used in business processes, culminating in the
    massive production of electronic records. However, there is a lack of policies
    and procedures that govern their management.

    in EDRMS implementation (e.g. Keakopa, 2007; Mosweu, 2016). The study by Keakopa
    (2007) focused on the policies and procedures for the management of electronic
    records in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. The findings established non-existence
    of the policies and procedures in Botswana and Namibia, while in South Africa,
    they were in place and operational. Mosweu (2016) assessed critical success factors
    for EDRMS implementation at the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry in
    Botswana and found that they included top management support, system user training,
    change management and project governance.

    been conducted. These include but not limited to research on managing email as
    electronic records, managing electronic records in financial services parastatals,
    e-records readiness, adoption and use of an EDRMS, digitization of historical
    records for preservation and enterprise digital records management (Sigauke &
    Nengomasha, 2012; Nkala et al., 2012; Chaterera, 2013, Sigauke et al., 2016; Chaterera,
    et al., 2018; Chikomba, 2018; and Nengomasha & Chikomba, 2018). Despite their
    differences in approach and focus, these studies share the common ground that
    electronic records management in Zimbabwe is still in its infancy. A myriad of
    challenges, weaknesses and shortfalls in managing electronic records are yet to
    be addressed.

    in developing countries, electronic records management is still a distant practice
    as paper records management systems dominate. Over the years, archives and records
    management professionals in developing countries have embraced managing manual
    records and developed skills and competencies for the conventional paper records.
    The same cannot be said for electronic records management. As documented in extant
    literature, Southern Africa’s records and archives management practitioners have
    struggled to embrace the advancements in technologies which have altered established
    existing archival theory, methodology and practice (Turnbaugh, 1997; Duranti,
    2001). While other parts of the globe are now in the fourth Industrial Revolution
    (4IR), countries in the Sub Saharan Africa are still battling with the proper
    management of paper records.

    and new modalities of recordkeeping with which records and information professionals

    in different ways to create different results. The identifying factors of Blockchain
    are that the technology is politically decentralised; it does not have an infrastructural
    point of failure; it offers self-sovereignty; and it is attack resistant. These
    and other characteristics as discussed in Chaterera-Zambuko (2019) as depicted
    in Figure 1, influence the adoption of Blockchain technology across diverse disciplines.

- en: Blockchain technology enables the creation of a decentralized environment, where
    transactions and data are not under the control of any third-party organization.
    Any transaction completed is recorded in a public ledger in a verifiable, secure
    and transparent way, with a time stamp and other details (Holotescu, 2018). Understanding
    the Blockchain technology can be simplified by likening it to a book. A book has
    a series of pages and each page in a book contains text as well as information
    about that page (not referring to the contents of the page but rather information
    about that page, technically known as metadata). For example, at the top of the
    page there is usually the title of the book and sometimes the chapter number or
    title; at the bottom is usually the page number which tells you where you are
    in the book.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, in a Blockchain, each block has the contents of the block; and a
    header which contains the data about the block, and thus. it includes some technical
    information about the block e.g. a reference to the previous block, and a fingerprint
    (hash) of the data contained in this block, among other things. This hash is important
    for ordering. Blocks in a chain refer to previous blocks, like page numbers in
    a book. With books, predictable page numbers make it easy to know the order of
    the pages. If one ripped out all the pages and shuffled them, it would be easy
    to put them back into the correct order where the story makes sense. With Blockchains,
    each block references the previous block, not by ‘block number’, but by the block’s
    fingerprint, which is wiser than a page number because the fingerprint itself
    is determined by the contents of the block (Lewis, 2015). Reference to previous
    blocks creates a chain of blocks, hence the term Blockchain.

- en: Several studies show that Blockchain technology can be effectively used for
    records management (e.g. Begley, 2017; Stančić, 2018; Lemieux et al., 2019). As
    such, governments and organisations have begun to seriously consider using the
    Blockchain technology to manage records. This is because records generated through
    Blockchain technology have been attested to be immutable and trustworthy (Lemieux,
    2017), a characteristic revered in records and archives management. As a relatively
    new technology best known for underlying cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology
    has great potential and may have a deep influence on document and records management
    (Stančić, 2018, p. 71). In fact, John (2019) opines that records management is
    one of the four Blockchain business initiatives that facilitates cost saving,
    provides opportunities for income generation and actually extend the capabilities
    of records management processes. Blockchain is thus applicable in various records
    management aspects which include records disposition, promoting authenticity of
    records, records appraisal, transfer, reliability of records and long term digital
    preservation of records, privacy and security of records (Lemieux, 2016; Stančić,
    2018; Lemieux et al., 2019; and Bhatia et al., 2020). The sections that follow
    briefly present an overview of the application of Blockchain technology on the
    stated aspects of records management.

- en: Records can be registered on a Blockchain to proof their authenticity. It is
    like certifying legal documents and financial statements. The technology enables
    the registration of an audit trail documentation for proof of process such as
    who did what, when and for how long (Jones, 2018). Authenticity is one of the
    four characteristics of a record, together with usability, integrity and reliability
    (ISO, 2016). It refers to the fact that the record has not been tampered with
    or corrupted, either accidentally or maliciously, and can thus be trusted as evidence
    of transactions completed (Duranti, 2009). Unlike centralised digital signature
    technologies, Blockchain does not use third parties but the authenticity of records
    can be demonstrated through signatures, finger prints and time stamps generated
    to authenticate them. These can be stored on the distributed ledger to provide
    proof of data integrity and authenticity. Storing signatures, along with a hash
    of the document, on a Blockchain removes the requirement for sequential signing
    and certificates. This could be particularly useful for long-term records, such
    as land deeds and wills (Bhatia et al., 2020)
  prefs: []

- en: Lemieux (2017) asks whether Blockchain technology delivers on the promise of
    producing and keeping trustworthy records. Blockchain as a recordkeeping technology
    does indeed ensure that records of transactions are immutable and thus remain

    representation of the transactions or activities to which they attest and can
    be depended upon in the course of subsequent transactions or activities. Authenticity,
    on the other hand, is reliant upon establishing and preserving the identity and
    the integrity of a record from its point of creation and thereafter (Lemieux,
    2019).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the fundamental issues for records management has been ensuring the authenticity
    and integrity of records. Blockchain presents records managers with a new way
    to ensure electronic systems offer integrity. Reliability of records starts from
    the point when they are created. Fundamental questions include who created the
    record and how it was exactly created. Digital signatures are one way of ensuring
    records reliability. They are a common form of transactional data. They can be
    stored on a Blockchain. Currently, when an electronic textual document such as
    a PDF is signed, the signature is stored in the document itself. To ensure the
    reliability of the record, it is crucial for signatures to be applied sequentially,
    and if the certificate expires, the validity of the document can be questioned.
    Storing signatures, along with a hash of the document, removes the requirement
    for sequential signing of certificates. This could be particularly useful for
    long-term records, such as land deeds and wills (NARA, 2019, p. 10).

    provides a record to users, it usually provides provenance and certification that
    it is a true and accurate copy. If there is any question afterwards, the copy
    is compared to the original. If the certificate of authenticity is retained in
    a Blockchain, the record could be re-hashed to determine if any changes or alterations
    have been made. Photographs can be altered, cropped, or otherwise modified by
    a researcher and if the hash fails upon comparison, then they would be able to
    prove the image has been changed. To achieve this, Blockchain uses cryptographic
    signatures and public keys to form a chain linked record of transactions which
    cannot be forged (NARA, 2019, p.10).

    which allows users to easily create fake videos without detection. Bockchain technology
    can be used to solve this challenge through the use of hashes in the metadata
    of a file so that external entities are in a position to validate that the digital

    indicate records retention and disposition were not included as part of the original
    intention of Blockchain developers” (Bhatia et al., 2020). The fact that records
    generated in Blockchain are immutable is both a good thing as it promotes records
    authenticity and also not so good for the retention of records. Blockchain technology
    is still nascent in terms of managing records, its capacity to integrate a solution
    with records retention schedules and classification systems remains undeveloped
    (Lemieux et al., 2019). Records retention is an indispensable aspect of records

    of records and archives. A related question is: what would then happen if traditional
    custodial approaches to long-term archival preservation fail to work in Blockchain
    recordkeeping contexts? This question arises in view of the fact that unlike archival
    systems which are designed to keep content accessible for long periods, Blockchain
    systems are limited in that regard. However, this does not dismiss Blockchain
    technology from being a potential records management tool. There are a couple

    when the certificate authority stops functioning (Chaterera et al., 2018; Bralić,

    attack (Stančić 2018, p. 62). Comparatively, a centralised database is prone to
    costly security breaches as it exposes a single point of failure (John, 2019).
    Blockchain technology therefore leverages public key infrastructure and cryptography
    which can be powerful tools for protecting data privacy.

    process brings efficiency in the form of limited errors, cost reduction and some
    consistency in the delivery of services. Hence, ICTs have been adopted in different
    sectors of the economy such as education, health, governance, manufacturing and
    the banking industry (Luka, 2012). In turn, researchers have focused their attention
    on getting to understand issues surrounding technology adoption. These include
    factors that promote and hinder adoption of technology, using different technology
    adoption models. Some of the commonly used models to anchor such studies include
    but are not limited to the Technology Adoption Model (TAM), Unified Theory of
    Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Technology–Organization–Environment
    Framework (TOEF), and the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) (Davis, 1989; Tornatzky

    2012 & Radif et al., 2016). As such, it is important to ensure that appropriate
    support systems are put in place when a decision is made to adopt any form of
    technology. Additionally, the personnel targeted to use the technology must receive
    proper orientation and training on how to use the technology (Mosweu et al., 2016).

    occurs (Yoo, 2017). As a distributed database of records or public ledger of all
    transactions undertaken, parties to the transaction verify by consensus the transactions.
    The majority has to agree that the record generated is accurate and complete.
    Once entered, information can never be erased (Yoo, 2017). Although advancements

    should be worthwhile. Decisions with financial implications must be carefully
    assessed. There has to be a meaningful return on investment. Records managers
    and archivists are advised to do a cost benefit analysis when contemplating the
    adoption of Blockchain for records management. There has to be a good understanding
    on the cost benefits offered by the technology. Ngulube (2011) posits that cost
    analysis is essential in planning for records management programmes. It leads
    to informed decision making about costs and benefits that may accrue to an organisation
    that desires to have a competitive edge having an effective and efficient system.
    However, available literature in Sub Saharan Africa indicates that undertaking
    cost benefit analysis is not a major area of concern for professionals in the
    sub-continent (Ngulube and Tafor, 2006; Kemoni et al., 2007; Ngoepe, 2009). In
    reality, a detailed cost benefit analysis for the implementation of Blockchain
    in records management is a necessity as it will avail options for the implementing
    organisation to go ahead with implementation with full knowledge that doing so
    will justify the money spent.

- en: Modern day organisations that seek to remain competitive, are compelled to embrace
    new technologies in order to survive (Qiang et al., 2012). The adoption of new
    technologies may bring benefits to organisations but it comes with security risks
    in the form of breaches (Dohertya et al., 2011). Caution must be exercised when
    implementing ICTs. Improved security had the second highest number of responses
    in terms of the perceived benefits of using Blockchain technology for records
    management accounting for 27 indications. This shows that the ability of a technology
    to offer security need not be overemphasised. As depicted in the proposed model,
    cyber security is a key factor to consider when adopting a new technology. Appropriate
    checks and verifications should be done on the strength of the technology from
    internal and external attacks such as illicit access and undetectable deletions
    and alterations that may threaten the authenticity of records. In cloud computing,
    for records management, the security of data is questionable (Mosweu et al.,2019).
    It is against this backdrop that McKemmish (2013) cautions that gains and benefits
    in technology implementation should be weighed against risks such as those pertaining
    to security and privacy. Although, McKemmish (2013)’s context was specifically
    for cloud-based records management, the same risks are also a concern in Blockchain
    based records management.

    be driven by pressure of adoption on the basis that everyone else is also doing
    it. Records managers should assess the long-term competitive advantage of adopting
    the technology. They should visualise the transformational impact of the technology.
    For example, what radical changes, the profession or organisation are likely to
    experience by adopting the new technology? Or, what are the perceived long and
    short term benefits to be achieved, etc? Answers to these and other questions
    will help in making an informed decision on whether to adopt the technology or
    let it pass.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Fourth Industrial Revolution (I4.0) has seen the emergence of disruptive
    technologies which many professionals and practitioners have found hard to ignore.
    Records managers and archivists have not been spared in this race to stay abreast
    of technological advancements. Overall, this study has established that records
    managers and archivists in Botswana and Zimbabwe are aware of the existence of
    Blockchain technology, although their respective organisations are not yet using
    the technology. Records managers and archivists in Botswana and Zimbabwe appreciate
    the potential benefits of Blockchain technology on records management and are
    willing to adopt the technology if the technology is indeed useful and easy to
    use. Apart from perceived usefulness and ease of use, other factors to be considered
    include seeking for greater clarity, evaluating options, looking at the return
    on investment and long term competitive advantage as well as cyber security.

- en: The use of Blockchain technology should however not be considered a silver bullet.
    There are issues that must be considered such as how to deal with malicious users,
    how controls are applied, and the limitations of the implementations. It is imperative
    to note that Blockchain recordkeeping system does not fundamentally change the
    existing record keeping and archival systems but augments them by adding an integrity-checking
    layer. Blockchain recordkeeping, however, does not require the existence of certificate
    issuing authorities, since public-private key pairs are self-generated within
    the system. Thus, incoming archival records can be re-signed while their original
    certificates are still valid, and cryptographically secured in a Blockchain in
    time ordered sequential manner as a basis for establishing their continued authenticity.
    While the technology may not be immune from the potential risks associated with
    new technologies, records managers and archivists are encouraged to embrace the
    technology as it offers considerable benefits.

- en: Modern supply chain applications are complex systems that play an important
    role in many different sectors. Supply chain management systems are implemented
    to handle increasing complexity and flows of goods. However, most of these systems
    are also increasing the complexity of providing trust and a global view of transactions
    in a distributed supply chain system. Blockchain technology introduces a new architectural
    style to support the traceability and trust of transactions performed by participants
    in a network. This chapter uses this emerging technology to realize a supply chain
    use case from JLP Meats in the UK with improved transparency, trust, and end-to-end
    querying while discussing potential challenges of realizing large-scale enterprise
    blockchain applications. The process of farm-to-fork is implemented and tested
    for traceability, item recall, block analysis, congestion enabling food safety,
    and sustainable agriculture. Potential challenges are highlighted in complex supply
    chains that need heterogeneous trade compliance and scalability.

- en: Supply Chain management is an integration of business processes that are implemented
    in distributed and heterogeneous systems from end-users to original suppliers
    (Cooper, Lambert, & Pagh, 1997). Current supply chain management systems have
    known limitations and the food supply chain is the most complex and fragmented
    of all supply chains (Martin, 2017). There are many participants involved in a
    supply chain and they are using distributed and heterogeneous systems increasing
    the complexity of integration, sharing information, end-to-end tracking, and compliance
    tracking. Moreover, various systems integrated with a supply chain can be exposed
    to cyber threats which will result in breaching the integrity of information in
    the supply chain (Gao, et al., 2018).

    system is a complicated network of isolated systems. There is no widely adopted
    industry standard regarding how to record and track data for food traceability
    purposes. Since blockchain technology is emerging as a distributed, trusted, and
    immutable ledger, it can be used to record transactions in farm-to-fork food systems
    enabling traceability (Martin, 2017). The number of transactions in a supply chain
    network is always huge. As an example, Walmart is serving 260 million customers
    every week across 28 countries in nearly 12,000 stores (Yiannas, 2018). A few
    of such participants in one blockchain network create millions of transactions
    and blocks which are continuously growing, challenge the scalability of blockchain
    networks.

    of various types of products before distributing them to their clients. Some of
    the detail of these transactions is redundant information. For example, thousands
    of packets of meat are made from one commodity hence only the packet identifier
    is different. Moreover, most of this information is needed for a certain limited
    period. Therefore, creating blocks of transactions for these types and have them
    stored in distributed ledgers of all other participants is a costly process in
    terms of congestion in the blockchain network and storage. On the other hand,
    having the same copy of records in all the ledgers support item traceability and
    auditing. However, end-to-end tracing of items is necessarily required in the
    modern complex supply chain systems.

    of commodities and goods, and hence increased the complexity of global supply
    chains (Martin, 2017). The regulator’s role in a blockchain is extremely challenging
    in current complex supply chains with diverse established old laws, regulations,
    and institutions distributed in various countries (Kshetri, 2018). Playing a monitoring
    role as in Gao, et al (2018) is not sufficient since they need to approve or reject
    transactions providing reasons. Regulators are interested in only the relevant
    information required for compliance. It is not required for them to know heterogeneous
    transactions happening in various contexts of regulations. Current blockchain
    architecture supports distributed ledgers of the equal state. A regulatory organization
    to become a participant of all the blockchain networks which need regulatory compliance
    and maintain ledgers of them is not a practical approach. Hence, the position
    of a regulatory organization in a blockchain network is still not clear.

    challenges to share private and sensitive information and enable only authorised
    participants to participate in a supply chain; for example, Bitcoin (Bitcoin,
    2020), Ethereum (Ethereum, 2020) and Litecoin (Litecoin, 2020). However, the permissioned
    blockchain platforms separate transactions into public transactions and private
    transactions and also enable authorisation, for example, Hyperledger Fabric (Hyperledger,
    2020) and Quorum (Quorum, 2020). Hyperledger Fabric has a reliable technology
    stack to implement supply chain applications compared to other private and permissioned
    blockchains and that has been highly used for pilots in major organisations such
    as IBM and Walmart (Kshetri, 2018). Hyperledger Fabric is a modular blockchain
    framework that supports plug-and-play components that are aimed for use within
    private enterprises (Kenton, 2020). However, most of these pilots are focussing
    on end-to-end tracing and still need to elaborate on other challenges such as
    item recall, blockchain congestion, data redundancy, scalability, regulatory compliance,
    etc.

- en: Supply chain management is an integration of business processes that are implemented
    in distributed and heterogeneous systems from end-users to original suppliers
    (Cooper, Lambert, & Pagh, 1997). The participants in a large supply chain are
    generally operating in so many countries under various constraints and legislations.
    Besides, the food supply chains are trying to provide a more diverse, convenient,
    and economical source of food while facing enormous new challenges. Moreover,
    in today’s food supply system, the output from one ingredient producer could end
    up in thousands of new products on a grocery store shelf (Yiannas, 2018). This
    distributed behaviour and the complexity of food supply chains becomes more complicated
    when also taking necessary actions for food contamination concerns such as the
    peanut butter Salmonella outbreak¹ in 2008, the E. coli. illness caused by contaminated
    flour² in 2016, Outbreak of E. coli. infections linked to clover sprouts³ in 2020,
    etc. The food supply chain also suffers dynamic costs, prices, and regulatory
    compliance.

    supply chain (farmer, processor, distributor, retailer, etc.) tracks and records
    data for food traceability purposes (Yiannas, 2018). Most of the participants
    are still recording their data on paper or their legacy systems which do not enable
    necessary mapping records and communications needed for detailed traceability
    and transparency. Moreover, current supply chain applications suffer from the
    integration of isolated systems and security breaches regarding the integrity
    of transactions. Radio-frequency identification (RFID), telematics, barcode and
    2D codes, sensors-enabled technologies, Internet of Things(IoT), and numerous
    other technologies are used for tracking products through supply chains (Davor
    & Domagoj, 2018). However, the true potential of tracking data is not fully exploited
    as the underlying data is available only within companies or partially connected
    isolated systems. The communication between systems and the lack of trust between
    the segments of the systems are the main concerns in the current supply chain
    systems. The supply chain-related sustainability incidents suggest that firms
    with a global presence struggle to improve environmental, social, and economic
    outcomes in global supply chains (Esteban Koberg, 2018). The firms should be accountable
    for the environmental, social, and economic outcomes caused by their internal
    and supplier operations.

    problem that promises traceability, immutability, and transparency of transactions
    (Nakamoto, 2008). The blockchain technology has evolved from cryptocurrency transactions
    and disrupts constantly enlarging areas of the economy (Davor & Domagoj, 2018).
    This technology can provide improved traceability, transparency, and tradability
    for supply chain systems (Consensys, 2020). Thus, blockchain and distributed ledger
    technologies are becoming increasingly popular in the supply chain applications
    domain (Martin, 2017). The blockchain technology promises overpowering trust issues
    and allows a secure and authenticated system for logistics and supply chains.
    This lead to revolutionise supply chain systems using blockchain technology. Pilot
    projects already exist within big organisations; for example, the farm-to-fork⁴
    process can adopt IoT and blockchain technologies to improve control and flexibility
    while increasing food trust and brand protection.

    as shown in Figure. 1 (Siemens, 2019). These solutions use the blockchain technology
    to implement trust throughout the process. This framework allows companies to
    limit information viewing privileges hence sensitive information can be kept behind
    closed doors while exposing only critical information to other members of the
    supply chain. This platform further enables leveraging IoT and blockchain for
    a “digital twin” (Meyvaert, 2020). A digital twin in IoT is a virtual representation
    of a physical product or process, used to understand and predict the physical
    counterpart’s performance characteristics (Meyvaert, 2020). Digital twins are
    used throughout the product lifecycle and blockchain enables them to record all
    the information in immutable records.

    accessibility of data streams can support compliance, reliability, and transparency
    of modern supply chain systems (Perboli, Musso, & Rosano, 2018). A supply chain
    as a blockchain, is a two-step block construction mechanism as suggested by Gao
    et al. (2018) classifies participants as ordinary users, third-party users, and
    supporting entities with different roles. In their approach, regulatory organizations
    are focusing on monitoring information. A monitoring agent to monitor and analyse
    blockchain transactions, nodes, blocks, and smart contracts to ensure blockchains
    operate legally, efficiently, and reliably are discussed in (Ko, Lee, Jeong, &

    ledgers provide transaction information accessible to all the participants in
    the blockchain network providing greater transparency (Zheng, Xie, Dai, Chen,
    & Wang, 2017). However, organizations are reluctant to expose sensitive information
    in a public ledger, and hence private data collections are introduced by Benhamouda,
    Halevi & Halevi (2018) to manage sensitive information. Privacy, scalability,
    and lack of governance are still major concerns for large scale industrial adaptation
    of blockchain paradigms (Li, Sforzin, Fedorov, & Karame, 2017).

    T[n] are transactions. k, m, n are Integers. h () is the hash function. Here,
    the authors assume a block is created including three transactions. Blockchain
    grows continuously based on the transactions created by the participants in the
    network. Participants will transact based on their own needs and blocks are added
    to the continuously growing blockchain. Transaction information retrieval is a
    challenge because there is no relationship between transactions. For example,
    item traceability needs all the transactions related to one item, auditing needs
    to audit a set of transactions, etc. However, different blockchain platforms provide
    various methods to retrieve transaction information. Hyperledger Fabric has the
    composer-rest-server which provides REST endpoints for each asset.

    transactions in the process of transforming resources to end-user products. There
    are intermediate participants in the blockchain network who develop the main resource
    into various products and distribute them to clients. These scenarios will add
    millions of records to the blockchain. This leads to several challenges regarding
    block congestion in the blockchain network and data redundancy at the participants.
    All the transactions happening in the product life cycle are not equally important
    to all the participants in the blockchain network, hence a compensation model
    for transaction verification is needed. As in Figure. 7, P4 makes different products
    from the main resource and distributes them to P5 and P6.

    based on product creation and requirements of clients. The same will apply to
    T[11], T[12,] and T[…]. If there are several intermediate participants of the
    type P4 who develop sub-products, this will add millions of records to the blockchain
    developing real-time congestion in the blockchain network. Moreover, this will
    add redundant data to the blockchain. This is a continuously growing real-time
    overhead which brings a negative impact to the scalability of blockchain networks.
    Managing temporal data to reduce transaction redundancy and transaction verification
    for supply chain applications still need major developments. IoT devices are integrated
    with supply chains and they generate millions of records throughout the supply
    chain. Ad hoc solutions can be adopted to manage these records, for example, Hyperledger
    Fabric support plug-and-play local data stores to record the IoT data, and only
    the hashes of sets of data are recorded in the blockchain. IoT integration to
    supply chains is a common scenario, hence new standards are necessary for blockchain
    integration with IoT.

    up in various territories. Regulatory organisations in various territories are
    interested in only a specific set of information regarding supply chain transactions
    for compliance checking. In the current blockchain architecture, participants
    will maintain the complete blockchain hence regulator’s role as a participant
    in the blockchain network is not practical. So far, none of the blockchain architectures
    provide necessary standards to position regulators in blockchains.

    Referring to Figure. 9, ORG 1 to 4 and ORG 1 to 3 are connected in two blockchain
    networks. REG ORG has a private channel connecting ORG3 and ORG 2 of two different
    blockchain networks. Regulatory organizations in various territories can become
    authorized members of this private channel and that eases quick validation of
    supply chain transactions without long delays as in the current system. This can
    further support transparent compliance checking for anyone who needs to send items
    through a supply chain. This topic area needs further elaboration because there
    are no proper standards or mature products so far, to fast track regulatory compliance
    and blockchain technology has shown a lot of promise in this area.

    be directed to the regulatory organization, and distributed ledgers are updated
    with the blocks of approved or rejected transactions. A block of approved or rejected
    transactions are kept in the regulator data store as {hash(block), block}. The
    hash of the block is recorded on the blockchain. In this approach, regulators
    do not need to keep unnecessary records and they only keep records of their processed
    records (approved or rejected records). Future applications can use this recorded
    data. For example, since these blocks have necessary hash keys on the blockchain,
    audit trails can be done connecting to a ledger of a participant in the network.

    The recall of items can be processed accordingly for the selected commodities.
    It is not necessary to recall all the packets provided by JLP or the farmer. This
    approach helps faster recall of all the items from clients and stores stopping
    further damage in terms of health and finance. The necessary workflows can be
    developed to expand as needed.

    to assure trust. However, the private channels, local data stores, and plug-and-play
    modular architecture of Hyperledger Fabric can be improved to develop necessary

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain Technology is a potential technology to realize complex supply chain
    applications because of its nature of immutable and distributed ledgers which
    help to ease traceability and ensure the trust of heterogeneous transactions.
    Traceability and trust of transactions are extremely important in supply chain
    applications. Most of the pilot studies presented in the literature discuss traceability
    and they do not discuss in detail transaction verifications, congestion, regulatory
    compliance, and necessary standards.

- en: This chapter implements a supply chain use case using Hyperledger Fabric and
    illustrates the farm-to-fork process relating to the food supply industry, traceability,
    item recall, transaction congestion, regulatory compliance, necessary standards,
    etc. Moreover, authors are highlighting necessary improvements to realise complex
    supply chains with connecting regulators placed in various countries, integrating
    with IoT systems, managing redundant data, and managing a large volume of transactions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is noticeable that current blockchain architectures and key-value data stores
    do not directly support end-to-end traceability of assets, item recall, and lacking
    necessary standards. Developers should, therefore, involve and develop necessary
    workflows. The authors propose a private channel concept to position a regulator
    in a blockchain network, minimizing data redundancy and ensuring auditing. However,
    continuous improvements are needed to manage block congestion, transaction verification,
    and compensation management in real-time complex blockchain applications.

- en: Cryptocurrencies often also serve money laundering activities, terrorist financing,
    tax evasion, and other illegitimate activities with a market value of more than
    7 billion euros across the globe, though the total amount is hardly measurable.
    Indeed, the blockchain technology involves many virtual currencies, including
    bitcoin, to conduct various financial transactions related practices throughout
    the world economies. Besides, other blockchain applications are making positive
    contributions to a wide array of other industries including healthcare, supply
    chain, manufacturing, etc. This technology which constitutes the backbone of digital
    assets transactions currencies is characterized by anonymity, privacy, security,
    and speed. In this sense, for tax administration authorities, detection of financial
    fraud and regulations with respect to taxation of virtual transactions pose newer
    emerging challenges. This chapter aims to examine the blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies,
    especially bitcoin, and look into regulations by world governments to combat tax
    evasion and illegal transactions.

- en: The Blockchain is the software architectural structure of the new are. In fact,
    in the Blockchain as a database, data are recorded into blocks in an ordered manner.
    Each record has a time stamp. When a block is full, the next block is created,
    and the blocks are connected to each other in the form of a chain. Today, in information
    systems, databases are the most used constructs. This situation is also valid
    for the Blockchain. A Blockchain may be created for each project, each cryptocurrency
    and each recording system. In this sense, the Blockchain is a record book. We
    may call this a “general ledger” (Güven, Şahinöz, 2018).

    Blockchain technology, or distributed ledger technology (DTL), is a technology
    protocol that makes it possible for the exchange of data between two parties without
    needing an intermediary.” In terms of security, the Blockchain is superior, as
    all records in the chain are at the same level with same privileges, and cannot
    be changed, without an agreed consensus. It is not in question for the system
    to crash, be hacked or its data getting deleted. As an important discovery, the
    Blockchain may be used in terms of social, political and legal aspects. The most
    popular applications of the Blockchain technology are in the transaction of cryptocurrencies.'

- en: Creation of cryptocurrencies occurs without the control of any state or government,
    and does not show any physical aspect; these are virtual currencies. Cryptocurrencies
    are created by “miners” with the Blockchain technology and mathematical encryption
    methods. By adding a new link to the chain existing over the Internet, miners
    gain money in exchange. This amount of production is limited to 21 million units
    for Bitcoin, which is the most prevalently used virtual currency among the many
    cryptocurrencies. In the Blockchain, where Bitcoin operations are recorded, all
    past transactions can be seen and monitored. However, the account owners are not
    clearly known, therefore all operations take place anonymously. In this aspect,
    it is often also used for the purposes of money laundering and the underground
    economy. This in turn causes the prevalence of tax evasion. The main issue in
    tax evasion is the anonymity meaning that cryptocurrency users remain hidden,
    and their transactions cannot be taxed, which in turn creates an undetectable
    area. Accordingly, Bitcoin is sometimes described as a “tax haven”.

    cryptocurrencies within the taxation systems. While these cryptocurrencies are
    now being taxed in some countries, they are still outside the taxing system in
    other countries. There is still no clear decision on how cryptocurrencies can
    be brought under the income tax systems. In general, Bitcoin income is being regarded
    as “commodity”, rather than money. In the cryptocurrency scenario, money is created
    as much as the amount declared during establishment by following publicly available
    methods that are known by all concerned. On the other hand, in the conventional
    monetary system, the state may create as much money as it wants through the central
    bank, and the state is the guarantor in this process (Çarkacıoğlu, 2016). Bitcoin
    production requires a highly difficult process. However, looking at its usage,
    one may see that it is being used by many large organizations worldwide including
    Wikipedia, Virgin Galactic, Tesla, Microsoft, Overstock, Namecheap, etc. (White,
    2018). The superior properties of cryptocurrency have made it prevalent. These
    properties are security, anonymity, portability, bidirectionality, offline capacity,
    unlimited term, broad acceptability and user-friendliness (Matonis, 1995). These
    superior properties may also lead to negative effects that may result in tax evasion.

    products and services which are regulated mediators, electronic payment systems
    as non-bank mediators, cryptocurrencies which are mostly unregulated and may also
    be decentralized, online services and trading platforms, online gambling and e-commerce.

    made in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers
    that are linked in a peer-to-peer network (https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/Blockchain).
    A “Blockchain” is a particular type of data construct that is utilized in some
    distributed ledgers which stores and transfers data in packages called “blocks”
    that are linked to each other in a digital “chain”. Blockchains employ cryptographic
    and algorithmic techniques to record and synchronize data across a network in
    an immutable manner. The decentralized database managed by multiple participants
    is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). These are a specific application
    of the broader category of “shared ledgers”, which are simply defined as a shared
    record of data across different parties (World Bank Group, 2017).'

    and financial services. However, Blockchain may theoretically be applied in many
    different sectors, though this technology is specific to Bitcoin for problem solving
    of “double-spending”. Prior to Bitcoin, an account holder was relieved of worries
    about their transactions and account balances by getting reconciled over a trustworthy
    independent platform. Now, however, an essential technology has been developed
    for digital currencies; this is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
    With this, the institutional requirement for trust is eliminated since the security
    and safety system is of integrity in a localized ledger through a network of participants
    on the basis of anonymity (Natarajan et al., 2017).

    way where a proof-of-work is described as valid through evaluation performed in
    ten-minute periods, and a higher difficulty score makes the protocol valid, out
    of the two produced at one moment. “Miners” are individually remunerated with
    Bitcoins for every valid proof of work (Natarajan et al., 2017).

    sharing among multiple databases. The stored datum is unique despite being collected
    by different sources, because a decentralized but integrated network of computer
    servers retains and checks all the data for avoiding double entry. Cryptography-based
    Blockchain either creates or verifies the data structure using certain mathematical
    algorithms (Natarajan et al., 2017). With this cryptographic solution, the institutional
    requirement for trust is eliminated since the security and safety system is of
    integrity in a localized ledger through a network of participants on the basis
    of anonymity. As a mechanism or data structure, Blockchain unalterably retains
    data through cryptographic and algorithmic techniques in a specific way. This
    technology has a potential in different contexts and is interchangeably used with
    another term, ‘distributed ledger technology’ (Natarajan et al., 2017).

    the Missing Trader Intra Community (MTIC) fraud that is frequently encountered
    in the EU (Europol, 2020). It is one of the most commonly encountered forms of
    VAT fraud in Europe. The 2018-2021 EU Policy Cycle (https://www.europol.europa.eu/empact)
    showed MTIC fraud among the nine crimes representing the priority areas of crime.
    Additionally, Blockchain practices can also prevent double taxation and transfer
    pricing. Ainsworth, Alwohaibi, Cheetham and Tirand (2018) developed a model established
    on cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, in tax collection, they developed a system for
    Gulf countries as a “crypto tax currency” system. In these operations, VATcoin
    was be used, and all operations were dependent on the Blockchain. In Blockchain
    practices, it is sufficient for the customer to pay the bill to the business and
    businesses to pay these bills to their suppliers (Deloitte, 2017). In this way,
    VAT fraud can be prevented.

    advantages. After all, inspection involves substantiation of recorded operations
    with relevant, secure, objective and confirmable evidence. Blockchain will provide
    positive effects such as achieving tax confidence between the employee and the

    income administrations as well. In Thailand, the Bangkok Income Administration
    has been using this system since 2018 (Uti, 2018). Additionally, the United Kingdom
    is also among the pioneering countries (HMRC,2019). In the United Kingdom, HMRC
    has presented its “Making Tax Digital” project, an initiative with the purpose
    of getting rid of the paper-based, long-after-the-fact tax return by 2020\. HMRC
    will gather and process information affecting tax in as close to real-time as
    possible, to prevent taxes due or repayments owed from further building up (Asquith,
    2016). The World Economic Forum has discussed when countries will start to collect
    taxes with the means of the Blockchain, and most participants thought that such
    practices would start in the year 2013 (Ainsworth & Shact, 2016).

    see that they have started to be used highly prevalently today. Cryptocurrencies
    are electronically issued by private developers to substitute value for exchange
    as a denomination in a special unit of account (Dong He et al., 2016). Bitcoin
    became one of the first and most valuable currencies among cryptocurrencies. It
    is a digital asset which can be bought, sold and transferred between two parties
    securely over the Internet (Nooruddin, 2019). Like other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin,
    a peer-to-peer electronic cash mechanism, can securely pay purchases in either
    real or digital world. Cryptocurrency developers build these protocols using advanced
    systems, so, they make it difficult to duplicate or alter the protected currencies
    and transactions (Martucci, 2018). Now, there are 2,247 different cryptocurrencies
    worldwide, all of varying value, utility and market capitalization (Coinmarketcap,
    2019). Cryptocurrency exchanges are very important in creating liquid markets
    for popular cryptocurrencies. In 2019, BitPremier reviewed and named its top 13

- en: Cryptocurrencies have multiple advantages, mostly due to their technological
    properties including cybersecurity, cryptography, trust, decentralization and
    transparency. The double-spending problem disappears by means of the Blockchain
    technology which delegates the authority of verification from one center onto
    the global network. In this respect, the digital currency market is built on mistrust
    among users for conventional finance, and the third-party financial authority
    could be disqualified by the peer-to-peer consensus on its efficiency (Schipor,
    2019; Gerger, 2020). As cryptocurrencies are not taxed in many countries, they
    are not subject to any tax cuts or tax revenues. Additionally, as they do not
    have a center, they do not require an administrator. Their costs and operational
    times are low in this matter. The operations are not monitored by anyone, and
    it is easy to transport, store and protect currency. As the cryptographic digital
    signatures method is used for the security of the system, this prevents the currency
    from being imitated. As the amount of created cryptocurrency is fixed, it does
    not have a risk of encountering inflation or disinflation (Kızıl 2019, Çarkacıoğlu
    2016). Cryptocurrencies are tempting for illegal operations such as terrorist
    acts, drug dealing and money laundering because the account holder remains anonymous,
    and a financial intermediary is also unnecessary for digital transactions so that
    crime investigators can hardly get informed to catch criminals, and thereby, these
    stay out of their control area (Schipor, 2019).

    (Schipor, 2019). Cryptocurrencies could become a main tool in financial systems,
    and there will be a risk on financial stability (Carstens, 2018). In the European
    Union, according to the chairman of BIS (Bank for International Settlements),
    the related policy intervention should be adopted, or otherwise, the financial

    cryptocurrencies may pose due to their integration to the traditional financial

    so, there exist variations in taxation of this currency (Ram, 2017). Virtual currencies
    are taxed as commodities because these are different to normal currencies, and
    this characteristic may determine taxation for consumption taxes including the
    value added tax (VAT), income tax including capital gains, wealth tax including
    wealth transfers and other potential taxable items. The rising exchange rate provides
    income and capital gains, though there is no actual transaction, which in turn
    initiates taxing the value difference. This case may occur in different situations
    where the rate of multiple virtual currencies even in a basket changes or where
    these are directly non-exchangeable to a fiat currency. Furthermore, the decrease
    is also equally treated as being taxed like an increase (Ram, 2018).

    It is also difficult to monitor by income tax administrations. As cryptocurrencies
    are not on a legal basis, they do not have a regular exchange. This increases
    the volatility of the currency and makes it a target for speculators. Therefore,
    this results in an imbalanced pricing of the currency (Kizil, 2019).

    for this is that monitoring of money laundering and terrorism financing becomes
    difficult, and tax evasion increases. Besides, other issues may include losing
    the monopoly of printing money, deprivation of seigniorage income, possibility
    of reducing the effectiveness of monetary policy, liquidity management becoming
    difficult, and concerns of deflation. For these reasons, states have rightfully
    approached cryptocurrencies from a certain distance (Güven and Şahinöz, 2018).

    to take the usage of cryptocurrencies under control by issuing legal regulations

    prosecute those who use Bitcoin for illegitimate activities (IRS, 2014). It is

- en: Income administrations are disturbed by the prevalence of tax evasion due to
    the usage of cryptocurrencies. This is because preference of cryptocurrencies
    due to their superior properties in the unofficial economy such as anonymity and
    privacy has increased the illegal exchange of goods and services between people
    at distant locations. Additionally, if they do not wish to do so, taxpayers might
    not declare the value increases in their cryptocurrencies. Although it is possible
    to monitor large sums of investments, based on the idea that a person can open
    any desired number of accounts, it is possible for these individuals to divide
    illegal transactions into small volumes in a way that would not attract attention.
    Based on this, the FBI managed to crash the Silk Road market, and they arrested
    their leader (Fanusie and Robinson, 2018). It is not yet possible to calculate
    the loss of taxes arising from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency usage. Cryptocurrencies
    may be employed to launder money or fund terrorism (Güven and Şahinöz, 2018).

    In the report, it was stated that cryptocurrencies became a highly potential instrument
    to evade tax. The subjects of this criminal act tend to use cryptocurrencies mainly
    because they can stay anonymous while using the option to cover their identity
    and due to the peer-to-peer characteristic of the virtual transactions and the
    potentiality for international operations. Such digital currencies have tax implications
    depending on their connection to a currency function of a means of exchange or
    a store of worth in economics.

    a profound evaluation of sophisticated matters arising from the schematic structure
    and subtle operations (IMF, 2016). Blockchain practices will make Know Your Customer
    (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) actions both easy and highly practical.
    With Blockchain practices, it will be enough for an individual or firm to conduct
    a KYC operation only once (Güven and Şahinöz, 2018).

    Blockchain technology will in time allow monitoring in an easier way than monitoring
    the flows within the central monetary system. This is why it is important to make
    it prevalent instead of banning it and allow it to develop within its own ecosystem.
    For example, there are cryptocurrency ATMs setup at the Prague metro (Konakçı,
    2018). Again, in Switzerland, the largest railway company of the country has been
    selling Bitcoin from its own ticket sales ATMs spread around the country since
    November 2016\. Such policies may help monitoring and inspection of cryptocurrencies
    easier by pulling it towards the public sphere (Güven and Şahinöz, 2018).

    suitable to broaden their usage but have strict right regulations and apply small
    amounts of taxes on operations conducted with these currencies. Banning or ignoring
    these currencies is not a realistic solution. This is because uncertainty brings
    costs. This is why the grey area needs to be clarified. The public authority needs
    to be not excessively limiting but balancing.

    industries. Therefore, in recent times, the Blockchain technology has surpassed
    Bitcoin, and it has advanced in the public and private sectors. The Blockchain
    technology is a field that is still continuing to develop. Many firms have started
    to develop their own prototype technologies for the purpose of understanding the
    Blockchain technology. The Blockchain allows real-time monitoring and recording
    of the transition of digital currency, financial assets and other digital documents
    between two or more parties. Especially in terms of the public sector, a Blockchain
    technology that is provided by the central government via allowed entries may
    make it easier for everyone to access the system and provide achievement of security
    and privacy principles.

    cryptocurrencies in general and for Bitcoin that is prevalently used, in particular.
    Bitcoin is a new phenomenon on which there is inaccurate knowledge among taxpayers
    who believe that making transactions in digital currencies alleviates taxation
    and reporting liabilities. Bitcoin operations are legal and taxed in many countries.
    Additionally, income administrations have also started to adopt a taxation inspection
    system established on the Blockchain technology.

    well noted that usage of cryptocurrencies may be associated with illegal activities.
    Bitcoin is being used in issues such as terrorist activities, drug supply or money
    laundering. Taking this issue under control may be possible by also using the
    Blockchain technology at income administrations. Such administrations are already
    using and developing technologies such as Blockchain technologies, artificial
    intelligence, cloud computing and the Internet of Things (Gerger, 2020) for the

- en: In recent years, blockchain has emerged as a popular data structure for use
    in software solutions. However, its meteoric rise has not been without criticism.
    Blockchain has been the subject of intense discussion in the field of cybersecurity
    because of its structural characteristics, mainly the permanency and decentralization.
    However, the blockchain technology in this field has also received intense scrutiny
    and caused to raise questions, such as, Is the application of blockchain in the
    field simply a localized trend or a bait for investors, both without a hope for
    permanent game-changing solutions? and Is blockchain an architecture that will
    lead to lasting disruptions in cybersecurity? This chapter aims to provide a neutral
    overview of why blockchain has risen as a popular pivot in cybersecurity, its
    current applications in this field, and an evaluation of what the future holds
    for this technology given both its limitations and advantages.

- en: As an emergent technology, blockchain has been a crux of discussion and experimentation
    in many fields. One among these is cybersecurity - a fast-moving, ever-changing
    industry which is constantly at the mercy of changing norms. The blockchain technology
    did not emerge with cybersecurity solely in mind, but rather as a means of decentralizing
    data while maintaining trust between users. However, as blockchain grew in notability,
    its purpose expanded to academia and commerce, where it quickly developed in the
    cybersecurity area as well because of its intrinsic characteristics, commonly
    cited as immutability and decentralization.

    its constituent industries. As other technological norms evolve in tandem, cybersecurity
    must evolve at a relative rate in order to ensure the safety of - or alternatives
    to - such norms. To adhere to both the ever-changing norms of technology as well
    as the constant race for improved soundness and convenience for security, cybersecurity
    remains a field which is constantly evolving. As new architectures and protocols
    enter the public consciousness, such concepts always find their way into the sphere
    of cybersecurity discussion and research. Can these concepts be utilized to improve
    security? What implications do such concepts have for the field? One of these
    concepts is blockchain. The spur in discussion and research about blockchain has
    largely been fueled by both a desire for innovation as well as changing logistical
    cybersecurity structures which have already been considered as standard, such
    as the client-server or third-party authentication models. Blockchain stands as
    a contrast to historical architectures and security methodologies, and thus has
    brought some renewed hopes for researchers and businesses for the future, while
    others remain skeptical of its applicability.

    into a field, brings its own problems. These elements do exist in isolation, but
    alongside an omnipresent race for innovation, notability, or attracting the attention
    of investment without care for the integrity of proposed solutions. In the past
    few years, blockchain has shifted from a once curious concept into a pivotal discussion
    point in the fields of software, computer science, and cybersecurity. The exponential
    growth in popularity of blockchain has drawn rigorous debate; some voices purport
    blockchain to be a universal solution for filling prior gaps in historical fields,
    while others believe blockchain is simply a passing fad. As mentioned above, in
    cybersecurity especially, blockchain has remained a hot button yet also a controversial
    topic.

    the current field of cybersecurity, and evaluate its possible presence in the
    field in the future. The organization of this chapter is broken into three sections
    as follows. The first section outlines the characteristics of blockchain as they
    pertain to cybersecurity, discussing both the advantages of the blockchain architecture
    as well as the limitations and liabilities that its implementation could propose.
    The second section uses the first as a springboard to both discuss and evaluate
    the most popular currently discussed applications of blockchain within the cybersecurity
    field. The third section discusses the future implications of what impact blockchain
    will have on the cybersecurity field; it discusses both what opportunities blockchain
    has created which may continue to be influential in the future, as well as what
    issues a blockchain-centric future for cybersecurity may create.

- en: 'The usages of blockchain within cybersecurity and other perpendicular fields
    such as finance, typically lean on the core architectural traits of blockchain
    rather than more tangential extrapolations of its functionalities. Possible usages
    of blockchain within the field which have been promoted both by studies and private
    firms have included digital identity management, including digital signatures
    which is a direct derivative of the inherent functionality of the data structure.
    There are typically five core architectural characteristics of blockchain: decentralized,
    immutable, anonymous, cryptographically encrypted, and trust-based. Each of these
    elements has their own extrapolations within the field of cybersecurity (Yeasmin,
    2019; Yassein, 2019). Brief explanation is as follows:'

- en: • Decentralization refers to the structure of inter-node communication within
    a blockchain network. This is dependent in part on the type of blockchain deployed,
    which is discussed within sections below. Decentralization, in general, typically
    means there is no centralized authority for assignment of permissions and storage.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Immutability typically is a guarantee that data retains integrity and cannot
    be modified once stored; this is achieved in blockchain through the mutual agreement
    upon data between ledgers.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Anonymity is facilitated in part through the decentralized nature of blockchain.
    Since there is no central authority, identities are distinct only through their
    communication, not their identity. Since blockchain is typically built on asymmetric
    encryption, identities are based around keys rather than being tied to personal
    identifiable information. It should be noted that the anonymity facilitated by
    blockchain is not a lack of identity, but rather a lack of publicly centralized
    identity. The identity which exists is tied to a key rather than to an individual.
    This distinction is what allows smart contracts to exist. Theoretically, blockchain
    applications can eliminate anonymity by assigning identities to keys, but this
    would done be through a middleware implementation, not through an inherent function
    of blockchain itself.

- en: • Cryptographic encryption is a self-evident facet, as blockchain is built on
    asymmetric encryption between ledger storage and clients. Data within the ledger
    is encrypted while respective clients possess needed keys for decryption and management
    of their own data.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Trust-based is a slightly more complicated characteristic. Trust refers to
    the overall integrity and legitimacy of actions between authorities manipulating
    data within a wider network. Trust is built differently, depending on blockchain
    structure; “proof” mechanisms are used for facilitating access control, which
    is the basis of trust.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While these traits may overlap with fundamental concepts within cybersecurity,
    one striking issue which researchers have struggled with is the imprecise nature
    of blockchain. As a result of its vast usage and asymmetric, decentralized deployments
    from a wide variety of sources and usages, it is hard to universally consider
    any non-theoretical traits as standard. This lack of standardized foundations
    has meant that, especially in a concrete field such as cybersecurity (where standardized
    information, outcome, and reliability are apropos to applicability), blockchain
    can be hard to coherently develop solutions with or to study consistently. This
    has led to a strong nuance in research, which has in turn led to a strong communal
    desire for general classification for the purpose of further judging accessibility
    and applicability (Yassein, 2019).

- en: The architecture of blockchain itself is not singular; there are different categories
    for the structure of ledgers, such as the nature of visibility, or for what algorithm
    is used to guarantee trust. As such, some architectures are not suited for all
    applications in all given fields, and some are better suited than others. Intense
    research has been done for lending credence to the applicability of blockchain,
    both for the more generalized universal concept of blockchain itself, as well
    as the differentiations between variant architectures. This has been referred
    to as blockchain applicability framework. In this framework, the functionality
    of an application is contrasted with various variables to determine how its ecosystem
    fits (or fails to fit) not just into a blockchain itself, but also into individual
    categorizations of blockchain (such as public or private). It is divided into
    five domains; data and participation, technical attributes, security, trust parameters,
    and performance/efficiency. Each of these domains is constituted by several sub-domains,
    which themselves are structured around the aforementioned variables to determine
    the needs of a given system (Gourisetti, 2019).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are three main types of blockchain, each with its own distinct structures.
    These include public, “consortium”, and private. Refer to Figure 1\. In a public
    blockchain, every node within the ledger participates in verification, and thus
    creates a decentralized data structure. Public blockchains are permission-less,
    with every node carrying equal participation. This category of blockchain is typically
    deployed in ecosystems where every node is considered equal, most popularly, in
    cryptocurrencies. In a consortium blockchain, there are distributed permissions,
    unlike a public version. As a result, it is partially centralized; however, this
    creates a more secure environment, as the permissioned nodes allow relative security
    functionality. As such, the trust process is not universally mutual, but permissioned.
    Lastly, a private blockchain is one which is fully centralized. These blockchains
    are strictly permissioned and typically reserved for dictation by a central organization.
    Certain functionalities, such as read or write permissions, are controlled by
    centralized preference. As a result of centralization however, data is not guaranteed
    full integrity; thus, data tampering may occur in some environments, which may
    present an issue depending on the purpose the blockchain is meant to fulfill (Yeasmin,
    2019; Gourisetti, 2019; Yassein, 2019).

- en: 'As mentioned above, blockchain is built on the facilitation of trust between
    nodes. Within a given network, trust is one of the most important characteristics
    of any deployed system in cybersecurity. In order to build trust, blockchain architectures
    implement internal schemes called consensus algorithms, which are fundamental
    blueprints for how nodes communicate within a wider architecture. There are various
    different algorithms which can be used, and the choice of one over another typically
    relies on both the functionality as well as the category of blockchain in question.
    As such, choosing the correct algorithm, much like choosing the correct category
    of blockchain, is vital to an application’s functionality. These algorithms are
    used for fostering both reliable data integrity as well as the distribution of
    access control among nodes. There are three popular versions of consensus algorithms:
    proof of work, proof of stake, and proof of authority. In a proof of work algorithm,
    iterative blocks are created through challenges which are exponentially hard to
    create, but easy to verify. Thus, nodes must work to create a proof, creating
    an environment in which blocks are probabilistically near impossible to modify,
    and also work in an iterative chain manner. In a proof of stake algorithm, the
    trust is distributed. Nodes compete by offering relative proportions of their
    stake in a system in order to be selected as valid. Selected nodes then verify
    transactions as valid. Proof of authority works as a modified version of proof
    of stake; in addition to competing for validation, the identity of the node itself
    is put at stake when competing for validation.'

- en: As such, limited nodes maintain authority for approval at any given time. It
    is important to note that these are not the only forms of consensus algorithms;
    there are at least a dozen popular other ones which have been employed by various
    blockchain applications. Other forms of consensus algorithms may include proof
    of burn, an algorithm where authority is proven by burning an amount of a stake
    in a system from a node. However, the three algorithms mentioned above are typically
    the most common in wider extrapolatable discussions (Yeasmin, 2019; Gourisetti,
    2019).

    can be used to facilitate. This is, in part, why blockchain has been such a popular
    architecture within the field of information security. Trust can be most easily
    defined through the collective, foundational information security concepts of
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Research indicates that five primary
    factors support these operations: 1) the utilization of encryption algorithms
    to provide privacy, 2) identity-based algorithm through asymmetric or proof-of-identity
    techniques for authentication, 3) data immutability through storage and hash signatures
    for integrity, 4) the usage of digital operations such as signatures or certificates
    for guaranteeing non-repudiation, and 5) the examinable degradation, or presentable
    evidence regarding the norms of any given transactional operation. These five
    factors provide a continual foundation from which trust is built by the verifiability
    of transactions over time (Gorog, 2018).'

    which would otherwise disallow blockchain’s place in some fields (Gorog, 2018).'

    anonymity and encryption are features which are derivative of intrinsic qualities
    of blockchain, smart contracts are derivative of both blockchain’s inherent features
    of identity management and integral data storage. It is a protocol pre-baked into
    the transactional structure of the architecture. They allow for permanent, immutable
    agreements to take place between parties, which are then stored encrypted on the
    blockchain ledger (Yeasmin, 2019; Abbas, 2019). These contracts happen between
    nodes on a ledger, and facilitate guaranteed transactions, as well as the permanency
    of signatures between two parties. This feature is related to “Digital Signatures”,
    another aspect of blockchain architecture which facilitates an important need
    within the cybersecurity field. Digital signatures are related to identity management,
    and allow for a node - presumably held by a consistent entity - to sign transactions.
    It is most commonly facilitated through asymmetric cryptography (Huynh, 2019).

    protecting assets. A popular subcategory, information security, can be summarized
    with three facets: confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data (Andriole,
    2020). Researchers have noted that because of the exponential growth in reliance
    on technology, the demand for innovative cybersecurity tools and protocols has
    grown. Because of the timely presence and popularity of blockchain, it has become
    a popular staple within proposed cybersecurity whitepapers and studies. Some still
    ask, however, has blockchain proven itself as a pivotal concept to warrant such
    attention? Some academics, as well as business people, say it may be too early
    to tell, but the infant state of blockchain may foretell a future explosion of

    to investors, blockchain has largely been proposed as a solution for bridging
    gaps and solving unresolved issues in the field, regardless of the actual viability
    of it within that sub-category. This has also been a result of unproven theory;
    many business pitches and studies which tout blockchain have not provided proof-of-concept
    or deployed solutions, and have simply existed as quantifiably vague theory. However,
    with that having been said, this does not mean that blockchain cannot separately
    be a useful tool within the cybersecurity field aside from the above also being
    true. Four particular usages of blockchain have been more popularly touted as
    extrapolatable features: data integrity and confidentiality aside from human oversight,
    previously discussed data immutability and mutuality between nodes, scalability
    of usership, and permanency of user identities (Sharma, 2019).'

    impact, 3) pilot demonstration identification, and 4) planned demonstration development
    (Andriole, 2020). In the cybersecurity field, many applications of blockchain
    have stalled at step three; there is an abundance of discussion about the theorized
    impact of blockchain as well as the traits of it as an emerging technology, as
    well as theoretical applications within localized fields, but many theories have

    without discussing cryptocurrency, and cryptocurrency’s place in cybersecurity
    (Mohanta, 2019). While cryptocurrency is not a topic inherently related to cybersecurity,
    extrapolations of concepts introduced by cryptocurrency have found some level
    of integration - or at least discussion - within the field. This has been partially
    bolstered by the rise of features such as smart contracts popularized by the Ethereum
    platform (Polvora, 2020). Such extrapolations, besides smart contracts, have included
    ideas of permissioned policies and/or access controls based on relative token
    holding (Polvora, 2020). Such discussion has been largely influenced by ICOs,
    or “Initial Coin Offerings”, that are preliminary investment rounds of cryptocurrency
    ecosystems which mimic public company stock offerings. Ideas have included distributed
    token holdings, which in turn relate to relative access control or permissions
    in relation to an application’s ecosystem. Since the tokens are possessed immutably
    by wallets tied to specific identities, the owner of such identity can be considered
    to have concrete relative control as such (Polvora, 2020). Despite being in early
    stages, there has still been some level of proof-of-concept of many of these techniques.
    While there has, to some degree, been proof of such working - at least on small
    levels, in whitepapers, or in nascent stages - worries have still stemmed from
    various issues, such as identities being more at risk if compromised through tangential
    means (such as phishing or otherwise), as well as other more typical worries such
    as the previously discussed limitations of blockchain networks, which still ring
    true here.

    similar solutions in similar fields. Unlike blockchain, however, cloud computing
    solutions at times amplify narrow vulnerabilities, or can even create new surfaces
    of attack, like centralized data storage or shared access control. Blockchain
    has been proposed as a solution for replacing more centralized cloud-computing
    structures with decentralized architectures and eliminating vulnerabilities in
    turn. This is not to say that blockchain is fully impenetrable, but rather that
    the surfaces of attack are greatly distilled in comparison to simple cloud-computing
    solutions; this is partially because of the lack of singular points of entry on
    most implementations of blockchain architectures (Kshetri, 2017).

    are hard to evaluate in full, which in turn has led to segmented evaluations of
    their usage. This is because current designs vary greatly, and thus have made
    implementation as well as deployment and maintenance, difficult. Unlike many current
    systems, blockchain’s relative infancy combined with its requirement of high levels
    of sophisticated technical knowledge and complex setup requirements make it harder
    to be adopted widely (Vance, 2019). This has raised questions, particularly in
    the field of cybersecurity where concrete knowledge of what one is working with
    is of utmost importance. Despite the constant desire for innovation within the
    field, precedent is also very important within the industry among professionals,
    and the lack of large-scale precedent for blockchain’s usage has been a detriment
    to the spread of its adoption. This is not to say, however, that there have not
    been successful test cases or proof-of-concepts, simply that the wider application
    of blockchain within cybersecurity has been handicapped because of unfamiliarity
    and decency, as well as lack of historical usages proving its usefulness over
    more traditional implementations and architectures.

    has seen particular exponential interest in two cybersecurity fields: information
    security and Internet of Things (IoT) security. Out of these two subcategories,
    blockchain has received serious innovative attention for the Internet of Things.
    This has been a result of two major factors - the relative infancy of the IoT,
    and thus its timely popularity intersecting with the popularity of blockchain,
    as well the lack of current standardization and security measures for the IoT
    (Obaidat, 2019; Obaidat, 2020). Information security has also remained a popular
    category; though this is because of an overlap in motives between the field and
    the features of blockchain, namely, data integrity and availability (Ahram, 2017).
    Blockchain’s presence within the sphere of IoT cybersecurity discussion has been
    dual-faceted: the nature of the IoT can be said to simultaneously support and
    clash with blockchain architecture. On one hand, the need for standardized identity
    management, immutability of data, and peer-to-peer verification brought by blockchain
    perfectly suits the design structure of IoT devices and software. On the other
    hand, Blockchain’s exponential resource usage, especially when juxtaposed with
    the limited resources of IoT devices (Obaidat, 2019; Hassebo, 2018; Khodjaeva,
    2019), is a significant hurdle. While this has been an obstacle, it has not fully
    prevented possible solutions from manifesting; many theories have been proposed
    for circumventing this issue and maintaining the benefits of blockchain in turn,
    one such example being “LightChain” (Doku, 2019). The specifics of how blockchain
    may influence IoT spheres have been scattered and differ greatly between proposals
    and studies. Some ideas have included IoT devices as individual certified nodes,
    and all communications between such would be facilitated through smart contracts
    to guarantee validity, and track transactions (Kshetri, 2017).'

- en: IoT’s intersection with blockchain has led to a fierce debate over leveled integration.
    The severity of IoT vulnerabilities alongside their popularity has led to such
    research being fast-tracked (Obaidat, 2019). Many startups have already started
    to roll out whitepapers and prototypes for the usage of blockchain in IoT systems.
    Large conglomerates such as IBM have taken interest in these and have begun to
    distribute blockchain services for supply chains to rely on. These inter-business
    facilitations have elevated blockchain to industrial level discussion. Blockchain-based
    protocols have been proposed for the deployment of such architectures as safeguards
    in industrial systems which rely on wireless communications. The use of blockchain
    to validate identities between sources has made it an important discussion point
    for devices that vitally rely on communication from a select source of valid entities
    (Kshetri, 2017). The intersection of IoT and blockchain proposals, however, have
    not been without issue; depending on the infrastructure of blockchain implementation,
    which would be determined by the type of blockchain, there are possible privacy
    issues, considering the vast amount of data collected and transferred between
    IoT devices. There are already large concerns about IoT device interactions in
    this regard which have not been solved by consensus yet, especially considering
    an industry-wide lack of standardization. Blockchain’s integration with the IoT
    does not inherently solve these issues and may open up new issues because of its
    ledger-based distribution structure. Possible solutions to this have included
    tiered networks with individual private blockchains connected to wider public
    blockchains, distributed with fine-grained access controls. These architectures,
    however, have largely not been tested. Blockchain has been proposed also as a
    management platform for IoT devices, essentially functioning as a middleware for
    managing data, establishing permanent identities, and tokenizing privileges (Ali,
    2019).

    blockchain as a non-IoT data management platform has also been tested separately
    as another popular means. Due to its node-based structure as well as its immutable
    nature, blockchain has been used as a platform for simplifying user management,
    particularly in relation to cloud-based applications. This assists in facilitating
    access control, as well as bolstering user authentication methods and implementing
    single sign-on capabilities. Blockchain has also been proposed methodically through
    other approaches, one being an “API Approach”, where blockchain functions as an
    API to facilitate other functionalities rather than acting as a functional platform
    in and of itself. Some of these usages have included DevOps, cloud integration,
    and data analytics, particularly for apps, businesses, and ads (Ahram, 2017).
    As mentioned before, this may echo traits of cloud platforms. Much capacity has
    been given to comparing facets of cloud computing and blockchain platforms. Research
    has noted that some cloud platforms follow “zero trust” security models, and,
    similar to blockchain, fully employ encrypted transactional models. Blockchain,
    as a decentralized model for the most part (outside of modified architectures
    such as consortium), does lack the segmented control schemes which cloud computing
    allows, such as administrator oversight. However, blockchain arguably employs
    better identity management and data immutability, at the cost of compromising
    that client nodes bear more serious implications because of such. However, with
    current technology, hacking into a blockchain node would be significantly harder,
    as attacks would be limited to brute-forcing or client hijacking, both of which

    see how most current applications of blockchain are comparable to current applications
    of cloud computing. However, there are nuances between the two which may affect
    which is more viable for an application (or user/enterprise, in turn) to utilize.
    Cloud computing relies on a third party with physical infrastructure, while blockchain
    is decentralized through a ledger, but may be facilitated through a third-party
    vendor. These options may fit different companies differently: some may want a
    third party for validatory oversight, while others may want to eliminate middlemen.
    Similarly, physical infrastructure may suit some, while ledger-based immutability
    may be better for other companies. Blockchain and cloud computing are very similar,
    however, not on all fronts. For example, while both carry nuances in how they
    are permissioned, blockchain can be selected to operate as permission-less, while
    this would be a risk under most cloud computing paradigms. Other nuances between
    the two, such as the level of encryption, would be left up to individual organizations
    to evaluate depending on target and vendor specifications. Both still face challenges,
    however; cloud computing is a less recent and more developed standard, while blockchain
    still faces early implementation issues such as lack of security mechanisms. In
    theory, both face resource management issues, albeit for different reasons - blockchain
    because of the exponential growth of needed resources for transactions and ledger-size,
    while cloud computing because of limited hardware resources for storage and speed
    (Kshetri, 2017).'

    brands have largely crowded each other out from reaching wider accessibility.
    Larger brands such as Facebook or Twitter, however, have announced their own initiatives
    for developing blockchain-based solutions, some of which have intersected desires
    for immutable identity management and signatures (Ahram, 2017). Popular applications
    of digital certification have promised a functionality for replacing notarization
    and have hinted at ideas for replacing infrastructure for intangible assets such
    as copyrights or licenses, as well as storage for public and private records,
    and taking advantage of smart contracts for implementation of arbitration and
    real-life contracts. Current implementations of many of these practices leave
    systems open to data tampering or theft; blockchain solutions promise to bolster
    cybersecurity standards for storage and transaction through increased confidentiality
    and integrity. Many private companies have undertaken these ideas already but
    have yet to break into the mainstream for further serious consideration (Alexander,

    years; blockchain has been proposed as an alternative, and unlike many claims,

    solution for email because of immutable transaction records and identity nonrepudiation.
    Current issues of message authenticity, from which phishing and fraud emails currently
    stem, could be eroded by the implementation of blockchain systems. Endpoint security,
    on the other hand, ties into the aforementioned intersection of Blockchain’s popularity
    in relation to IoT security. Most IoT devices lack endpoint security measures,
    thus increasing the need for effective measures. Blockchain has been proposed
    as a solution primarily because attacks against blockchain-based architecture
    are weakened by the distributed architecture of blockchain, especially if data
    validation nodes are used. Much like email, use cases have been deployed for this
    as well, which have shown promising results (Vance, 2019).

    synchronization. In applications which require communication between individual
    nodes, or applications which rely on synchronization, blockchain has become an
    important discussion pivot. This is very easy to see in its popularity in the
    IoT, but also applies to other fields, such as fields looking to synchronize clients
    without reliance on a centralized database. Peer to peer communicative clients,
    which still require a level of trust certification, have found blockchain to be
    a suitable solution. However, for larger peer networks, the resource consumption

    of new data structures (Yassein, 2019). The infancy and lack of standardization
    of blockchain has been a catalyst in many of these limitations (Ahram, 2017).
    Blockchain is not only a complex system in and of itself, but also it does not
    suit a “plug and play” style of development. This is a potential drawback for
    two reasons. Firstly, as blockchain is a relatively nascent architecture, it discourages
    many from adopting such because of it being unproven. However, the lack of adoption,
    in turn, means a lack of widespread security mechanisms have been tested or developed
    on a wide scale basis, in comparison to traditional methods which are more easily
    tested. The complex and intended large, decentralized nature of blockchain makes
    proof-of-concepts hard to evaluate in low-density or testing environments (Kshetri,
    2017). However, as blockchain matures as an architecture, many of these issues
    are expected to be solved, especially as it attracts more academic attention for
    research (Ahram, 2017; Kshetri, 2017).

    networks. “Majority” attacks, as exemplified in Figure 4, remain an issue in many
    networks, which can occur when a node controls the majority of stakes in a given
    environment. Similarly, “selfish mining” has remained an issue, where miners participate
    in creating blocks on a private branch and then only broadcast them to the public
    network once the chain is longer than the public network, thus replacing them
    (Abbas, 2019; Huynh, 2019). Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are also
    a threat to blockchain networks. This may occur when a dishonest node uses a large
    number of other nodes to attempt to overwhelm requests on the rest of the blockchain
    ledger (Huynh, 2019; Oksiiuk, 2020).

    measures, because of its integrity of permanency and ability to foster digital
    signature and identity management, the immutable status of identities on a blockchain
    also brings its own worries. While authentication strength is partially dependent
    on the strength of cryptographic implementation, there are tangential vulnerabilities
    which may call for greater worry than their non-blockchain counterparts. Primarily,
    phishing and social engineering carry more grave risks for blockchain authentication
    than they do for other authentication procedures. This is because of the immutable,
    permanent nature of identities on a blockchain; if information regarding an identity
    is compromised, depending on the nature of the Blockchain’s implementation, it
    may be permanently compromised (Oksiiuk, 2020).

    Firstly, block capacity is a large limitation. Wider implementations of blockchain
    have low block capacities, and while larger blocks can store more data, they cause
    significant performance and scaling issues. Smaller blocks, on the other hand,
    are reliable, but obviously limit the actual space for records. Secondly, because
    blockchain is a distributed ledger, the storage mechanism for large blockchains
    often does not take into account that ledgers are copied to the side of all users.
    This is, of course, dependent on implementation: some may circumvent this by using
    vendors or applications which simply facilitate access to a blockchain rather
    than distributing client nodes. Nevertheless, this remains an issue for some implementations;
    while this data is encrypted, it still opens data to data mining and other attacks
    depending on how the ledgers are actually accessed. It also means that attackers

    sphere will largely depend on the scale under which blockchain protrudes into
    the wider technical sphere. Both private and public (governmental) entities have
    commissioned research for enterprise implementations, but many of such remain,
    as aforementioned, confined to theorization or small-scaling testing rather than
    large-scale deployment. Most cybersecurity implications of where blockchain may

    off blockchain as a fad or instead proposes that current limitations on blockchain
    application architecture are enough to prevent it from being further pervasive
    in the future. Much discussion derivative of the former point does not necessarily
    agree with the possibility of blockchain’s ability to constitute such functionality.
    When it comes to the integration of blockchain with concepts such as contracts,
    financial transactions, or other communal activities, there is not much debate
    as to if such integration can be done, but rather if it should be done (Aggarwal,

    be open, transparent, and auditable, in order to circumvent worries which may
    otherwise manifest from the nature of the architecture. Most research on the future
    of blockchain in cybersecurity, and in wider fields to an extent, has indicated
    that the strongest promises of the architecture come from its facilitation of
    decentralization, and the ability for mutual, decentralized validation without
    the need for arbitrary authority (Oksiiuk, 2020). Such future implementations
    of blockchain may not be restricted solely to using public architectures but will
    have to pay close attention to caveats in individual blockchain categorizations
    according to the need of their applications. For example, applications which seek
    better privacy protections and better performance are more likely to depend on
    consortium blockchain models (Cai, 2018). It is important to note, however, that
    moving forward, the usage of the prior mentioned “blockchain applicability framework(s)”
    will be vital for this reason. Incorrect blockchain application may result not
    just in decreased performance but also in heightened security risks.

    evaluated as holistically secure. This means that individual parts of the architecture
    - the consensus algorithm, the category of blockchain, and even the separate structure
    of the application - must all be given strict security and performance guidelines
    (Cai, 2018). Future opportunities for blockchain in this light may not just present
    themselves as innovations utilizing blockchain but rather as innovations built

    providers. Referring to Figure 5, just as cloud-based cybersecurity applications
    are provided as a service, alongside the rise of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service),
    PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), and IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) models, research
    has indicated that the future of blockchain may popularize the model of Blockchain-as-a-Service
    (Andriole, 2020). This concept heavily ties into prior mentions of comparisons
    between blockchain and cloud computing; the similarity in service model and focused
    solutions also creates similarities on this front. Unlike cloud computing, however,
    a vendor would facilitate access rather than facilitate hosting. This is slightly
    different from the current cloud-computing model because a vendor is also liable
    for the actual maintenance of the core foundations of the platform. While the
    core functionality would be dependent on both the category of blockchain and consensus
    algorithm deployed, in this evolved model, a vendor would simply act as a front
    end for providing access to a ledger and, at best, moderate data on the application
    layer rather than the underlying data structure of blockchain. Some studies have
    noted that the rise of peer-to-peer ecosystems and contractor (“gig”) platforms
    could be similarly bolstered by implementations of blockchain. This would be because
    of the identity management functionality of the architecture as well as the decentralized
    structure, the implementation of cryptocurrencies and tokens, and, most importantly,
    the smart contract functionality. Such implementations would likely mimic “as-a-service”
    infrastructures (Fraga-Lamas, 2019).

    place in replacing and/or aiding the foundational architectures of communal and
    legal activities, such as securing the integrity and availability of inter-entity
    contracts or providing a secure basis for voting (Aggarwal, 2019). While there
    has not been practical mass application of most of such proposals to date, surveyed
    and commissioned research has pinpointed that blockchain could be utilized as
    a cybersecurity tool for securing government level infrastructural needs; research
    into such has been commissioned by multiple governments, including the UK for
    energy infrastructure, the US for secured domestic messaging between officials
    and for identity certification, and Australia for securing communication between
    entities inside of wider “smart cities” (Vance, 2019). Blockchain has also been
    proposed as a means of securing voting from malicious influence; proposals have
    stated that blockchain would bolster risk reduction through identity validation
    as well as increase the speed of digitization while minimizing infrastructural
    interactions (Alexander, 2019). On this government level, blockchain has been
    proposed not only for civilian level transactions but also for trans-active systems
    on an infrastructural level. For example, the integration of blockchain into power
    grids may allow for permissioned, traceable, and immutable records of transactions
    which provide a higher security than otherwise purely centralized mechanisms often
    currently deployed. Smart contracts have been proposed as having a strong usage
    in infrastructural concerns, both akin to power grids as mentioned prior, as well
    as other societal needs, such as field devices or generators (Li, et al., 2019).

    through the proposals for usage of ensuring trust and cybersecurity for complex
    energy transactions and data exchanges (Mylrea, 2017). Researchers have pointed
    out that, not only are many grids centralized but also that interconnectivity
    alongside current outdated technological means has made both energy grids as well
    as associated electrical infrastructure, greatly insecure. As cities move toward
    visions of smart cities, securing infrastructure becomes increasingly important
    as new vectors of attack become available. Blockchain’s ability to create a decentralized
    “Energy Internet of Things” makes systematic attacks on infrastructural grids
    harder by decentralizing vulnerabilities. The usage of smart contracts may also
    increase resilience and more reliably track energy transactions within infrastructure.
    Researchers note that the integration of blockchain will also help both single
    out anomalous entities or transactions within a system and allow for a more streamlined
    intersection of infrastructural needs such as electricity and the reporting of
    data. These ideas have been tested on a small scale within testbeds but have not
    yet been extrapolated to apply to large cities. Much like other specialized, large-scale
    theories, these concepts are often found trapped in a limbo of not being able
    to be deployed because of a lack of proof but also not carrying proof because
    of their need for large-scale deployment in order to create such (Mylrea, 2017).

    for immutability of data but is also vulnerable to majority or 51% of the attacks,
    which allows data to be modified. This creates concerns as to whether claims for
    the concept are fully understood and justified in how they are propagated between
    researchers, developers, governments, and business people. Current dissonances,

    these specialized systems, as seen with the above explanation of automotive integration,
    typically boil down to the same infrastructural benefits and limitations; these
    being standardization, identity management, and information security benefits,
    alongside limitations of scalability, complexity, and maintenance, amongst many
    others. Given that many of these benefits overlap concretely, it is hard to conclude
    whether blockchain is actually benefiting the individual fields or whether the
    field is simply absorbing the nature of blockchain. In other words, the discussion
    has often fallen on pivots of “How would this function on blockchain?” rather
    than “How would this benefit from blockchain?” Hence both the vague generality
    and the benefits being traits of blockchain rather than improved traits of the
    individual fields. It is important to note that this is not necessarily universal;
    fields such as the IoT have had far more conclusive discussion on the purpose
    and individualized benefits of blockchain implementation. However, from a wider
    generalized perspective, this harkens back to the early mentions of the “blockchain

    of blockchain and its relative nascence (Fraga-Lamas, 2019) as well as the existence
    of prior mentioned cyber-attacks (Oksiiuk, 2020). Lastly, the actual applicability
    of blockchain itself for certain functionalities over others remains a debate,
    hence the discussed existence of applicability frameworks (Gourisetti, 2019).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain is an exciting, relatively new architecture which has spurred a significant
    interest in both public and private sectors, particularly regarding its possible
    place within the cybersecurity field. However, despite the significant proposed
    innovation and sheer amount of discussion taking place, there is still no consensus
    as to what the future may hold for wider implementation. There is certainly a
    significant amount of both research and theory for projecting that the future
    of blockchain is bright. However, these promising implementations are held back
    by current limitations for which there is yet to be a consensus on how to fix,
    such as scalability and exponential resource usage. Specialized niches, especially
    within narrow uses such as IoT security, show the most promise for blockchain
    as an application structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Researchers mostly agree that the future of blockchain will largely be dependent
    on the ability of the architecture to adapt to the needs of enterprises which
    wish to adopt it. While there is much consensus as to the security benefits the
    adoption of blockchain may bring, questions about its detractions or about the
    sheer complexity and maintenance of its implementation, particularly on a wide-scale,
    have acted as a barrier for it penetrating further within the sphere of cybersecurity.
    As discussed within this chapter, the universality of Blockchain’s benefits have
    led to discussion about the actual benefits of blockchain, rather than if Blockchain’s
    usage actually suits an application or if blockchain itself just carries certain
    traits which applications adopting it would adopt in turn. These have led to frameworks
    being developed for the purpose of determining whether or not blockchain is actually
    needed. Some may say the excitement surrounding blockchain has, in part, obscured
    its adoption, because through its wider proposals for almost all forms of cybersecurity
    gaps, specialized sectors, for which its implementation is better suited, have
    received less attention.

- en: 'While blockchain continues to receive much attention, its place in cybersecurity
    is still uncertain. Although the benefits of the architecture may be inarguable,
    propositions of its integration beckon logistical and theoretical questions. Most
    importantly, the questions arise as to: should blockchain be integrated just because
    it can be? and do the benefits of blockchain outweigh the complexity and downsides?
    Unfortunately, there is no universal answer to such questions. Instead, the answers
    are largely determined by the individual factors of the application in question.
    Just as with the wider cybersecurity field, no matter what benefits may be innate
    to blockchain, the individual nuances and caveats of deployments are more determinate
    factors for integration than the supposed benefits of what is being integrated
    itself. As a result of this, it is no surprise that the proposed integrations
    of blockchain, which shine the most, are those which come from specialized systems,
    such as the Internet of Things. These systems do not benefit from blockchain solely
    because of the traits of blockchain but instead because the nature of such systems
    intersect with the structure and functionalities made available by blockchain
    architecture.'

- en: In financial trading, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin use decentralization, traceability,
    and anonymity features to perform transactional activities. These digital currencies,
    using the emerging blockchain technologies, are forming the basis of the largest
    unregulated markets in the world. This creates various regulatory challenges,
    including the illicit purchase of drugs and weapons, money laundering, and funding
    terrorist activities. This chapter analyzes various legal and ethical implications,
    their effects, and various solutions to overcome the inherent issues that are
    currently faced by the policymakers and regulators. The authors present the result
    of an analysis of 30 recently published peer-reviewed scientific publications
    and suggest various mechanisms that can help in the detection and prevention of
    illegal activities that currently account for a substantial proportion of cryptocurrency
    trading. They suggest methods and applications that can also be used to identify
    the dark marketplaces in the future.

- en: Trading in cryptocurrencies has become a global phenomenon in recent years.
    These are decentralized anonymous virtual currencies, that do not require central
    control by any central authority (Nakamoto, 2019). Cryptocurrencies can adapt
    to the challenges in the emerging digital economies and for funding purposes while
    engaging communities through crowdfunding and the peer-to-peer technology platforms
    (Tschorsch & Scheuermann, 2016). Therefore, cryptocurrencies, with the use of
    Blockchain technologies, have hit the news headlines due to their rapid growth
    in terms of both market volume and value, since around 2012 (Tschorsch & Scheuermann,
    2016).

- en: The first initiative for cryptocurrencies was the white paper, that was released
    under Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym in 2008\. It combined the ideas of Blockchain
    technology, decentralization, finite supply, and perfect anonymity to pave the
    way for the first virtual currency known as Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2019). Blockchain
    has been utilized in most of the business models, including supply chain (Alvarado
    & Halgamuge, 2019), multimedia (Shrestha et al., 2020), finance, and healthcare.
    In 2010, merchants like WordPress, Microsoft, and Expedia started accepting Bitcoin
    as their mode of payment, which led to the recognition of Bitcoin as a proper
    currency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As Bitcoin gained popularity, the idea of encrypted and decentralized currencies
    emerged, and the first alternative cryptocurrency appeared. This currency, called
    Altcoin, focused on improving the original Bitcoin design by offering several
    advantages like higher speed and anonymity. Therefore, this period became attractive
    to new start-ups, with currencies such as Namecoin and Litecoin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unsurprisingly, as a currency designed with a lack of control and anonymity
    in mind, Bitcoin proved to be a lucrative and attractive target for criminals.
    For example, in June 2014, a Bitcoin exchange called Mt. Gox went offline making
    the owners losing almost 750,000 Bitcoins. This case is still under investigation
    as it led to a total estimated loss of 400 million dollars. Due to such reasons,
    many countries have disallowed the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as they
    fear of them being used for illegal purposes such as trades involved in the black
    market (Fraser & Bouridane 2017; Kshetri & Voas 2017; Toyoda et al. 2017; Van
    Der Horst et al. 2017; Meiklejohn et al. 2013; Chadha & Kumar 2017).

- en: Misuse of Bitcoin is easily possible through the exploitation of pseudo-anonymity
    and use of Blockchain transactions. Moreover, the evidence for Bitcoins used in
    terrorist funding and money laundering has already been found (Kshetri & Voas
    2017; Toyoda et al. 2017; Van Der Horst et al. 2017; Chadha & Kumar 2017; Liu,
    Chen, et al. 2017). Therefore, there is a need for cooperation between the government
    agencies, with other agencies like banks and other financial regulators, to develop
    legal frameworks and to track the cryptocurrency transactions in order to put
    them in the tax domain.

- en: Most digital currencies are unregulated. Some countries consider them as legal,
    whereas others have banned them outright. For instance, use of cryptocurrency
    is banned in China, and even applying for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) in China
    is considered as an illegal activity. Countries that have adopted it into their
    financial system are facing problems related to taxation and the growth of illegal
    activities (Kshetri & Voas 2017; Toyoda et al. 2017; Van Der Horst et al. 2017;
    Meiklejohn et al. 2013; Chadha & Kumar 2017). Due to this reason, proper legislation
    needs to be framed (Shehhi et al., 2014).

    Most of the cryptocurrency articles focus only on Bitcoin, and no major study
    describes legal and ethical issues in the use of cryptocurrencies through the
    use of Blockchain trading. This chapter attempts to provide a glimpse of various
    issues in the use of cryptocurrencies and also to suggest methods and techniques
    to mitigate them.

- en: Being digital and virtual, cryptocurrencies have also led to the growth of darknet
    marketplaces. Therefore, the way the black markets operate has transformed into
    black-market e-commerce using these cryptocurrencies. The law enforcement agencies
    like the FBI are still investigating and tracking criminals who are using cryptocurrencies
    as their mode of money transfer in illegal activities. The solutions proposed
    in our chapter are through analyzing 30 scientific peer-reviewed articles, including
    techniques and solutions proposed by various authors, to discuss legal and ethical
    aspect of the topic. As per the analysis, most researchers have only observed
    one or a few issues in the use of cryptocurrencies; however, in our chapter, we
    analyze many more issues, together with providing practical workable suggestions.
    The applications that can be utilized to mitigate these issues and to track down
    the criminals behind these transactions are also investigated.

- en: Another important research gap is with respect to the regulations in tracking
    those who are using cryptocurrencies as their mode of payment in money transactions.
    This happens due to the anonymity nature of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, many
    issues in tracing criminals involved in money laundering and tax evaders are still
    remaining to be resolved. Many researchers are developing applications to trace
    the defaulters and to take necessary actions against these criminals. The present
    contribution also attempts to provide mechanisms to help reduce the criminal activities
    and to assist the regulators in tracking down the criminals, through shedding
    light on the dark side of the use of cryptocurrencies.

    aspects and the challenges of using cryptocurrencies to form a legal and ethical
    framework in controlling the use of cryptocurrencies. In this respect, the legal

    the control of the government bodies and other central authorities. So are the
    Blockchain structures that have characteristics of anonymity, security and no
    requirement of central authority to manage transactions. Since cryptocurrencies
    hold the promise of handling transactions easier without the need of third-party
    involvement, more money is flowing into the Bitcoin, Cryptocoin and other virtual
    currency ecosystems. In this section, we discuss the transactional areas where
    cryptocurrencies are being used and discuss the consequences of the manner in
    which these are transacted. Moreover, we attempt to analyze the legal and ethical
    implications of the use of cryptocurrencies, for a better understanding.

    like the technologies used, methods of security, secret manners of sharing, benefits
    and challenges; and look to reducing the adverse effects of undesirable activities

    the security, and legal and ethical issues related to cryptocurrencies. Comparison
    Table 1-8 summarise our findings on legal and ethical implications as reported
    in the said research papers. As a result, the use of Hierarchical Cipher Text
    Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-HABE) scheme is recommended for the encryption
    of the user’s identities, and a regulation node is suggested for the prevention
    of issues related to the currency. The different technologies that can be used
    to mitigate the adverse effects are also suggested. The scientific publications

    CP-HABE method is recommended by Wang and Gao (2018). Using this method, that
    includes users’ encrypted identities and Modified Signature (MS) algorithms for
    signatures, transactions are generated by users and sent to the blockchain first.
    The miners then verify the transactions, their signatures, and source of the used
    cryptocurrency. Finally, in the case where transactions are found suspicious,
    regulation nodes are used to decrypt the user's real identities. It can be used
    as a measurement in avoiding illegal transactions (Wang & Gao, 2018). This method,
    along with various other methods is used to fill the gaps in legal and ethical
    issues in cryptocurrencies as mentioned in Tables 1-8.

    public keys. Digital wallets are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (FDIC) and are not protected. Most of the digital wallet companies
    are going out of business because of this reason. Since, cryptocurrency transactions
    are tied to the “digital wallet ID”, rather than the user's actual name and their
    identity, these remain entirely anonymous. As a result of this, cryptocurrencies
    are being accepted as mode of transaction with respect to illegal products and
    services, for example, the “now-defunct Silk Road” (Kshetri & Voas 2017; Toyoda

    and external threats involving the private keys. There are two digital wallet
    types called Hot Wallets and Cold Wallets. Hot wallets require the private keys
    of the user to be stored on a machine that is connected to a network. On the other
    hand, Cold Wallets store private keys offline and not connected to a network.
    Based on this scenario, the threats that can take place using hot wallets and

    to regulate and to bring bitcoin transactions under tax bracket. In case of deregulated
    nature of bitcoins, users can lose private keys, and then it becomes much harder
    to prove who still owns the coins. There have been many thefts related to the
    loss of private keys, using Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, also called the 51%
    attacks. Here, more than 51 present of computing power is needed to be capable
    of modifying, excluding, and self-reversing transactions. Such thefts have occurred
    in many countries in the past.

    on transaction processing systems. The 51% attacks have been prevented through
    modifying the block header and by introducing extra bytes. During hash generation,
    the timestamp was effectively utilized to overcome issues related to this theft.
    However, proper formulation of strategies and implementation of security measures
    need to prevent this kind of theft. Detection of lost coins can be done by detecting
    the bitcoins having no movement on the blockchain. Table 2 shows the legal implications

    Users generally tend to hide assets in order to avoid paying taxes. Taxes can
    be evaded through using online private keys, as there is no proper legal framework
    related to the taxation of cryptocurrencies. There have been cases where untaxed
    foreign currencies have been coming into the country through the use of cryptocurrencies.
    However, in some countries, cryptocurrencies are banned. In Australia, the Australian
    Taxation Office (ATO) considers cryptocurrency as a form of property, to bring
    it into tax brackets. The ATO is consulting tax experts and lawyers regarding
    the development of a proper regime to overcome the related issues. In order to
    do this, the government needs to track cryptocurrency transactions and make sure
    the payments of all its taxes are done on time. The ATO warns bitcoin as “neither
    money nor a foreign currency”, and therefore, it should be taxed as an asset,
    and should not be a subject to the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Consequently,
    it should be treated as an asset as income to calculate it as the Capital Gains
    Tax (CGT).

    of tax evasion and making authorities for controlling currencies and payment systems

    therefore, government and other financial regulators are cooperating to develop
    proper legal frameworks to prevent the laundering of money. To track money laundering,

    it beyond the control of any monetary controlling powers. Due to this and due
    to the way Blockchains work, all the transactions handled are irreversible. Proper
    maintenance of transaction ledgers at every node, and validation of transaction
    at the distributive node (not by the central authority), are necessary to make
    this process more secure. In the case of Bitcoin, users have transparency of the
    validating code used and can participate in software development. However, there
    is no government control in transactions handled in such a decentralized manner.
    Therefore, regulations may help in imposing taxes and preventing black money sustainably.

    leaving a trace. Moreover, the Dark Net and ransomware are getting popular due
    to this. People behind these illegal activities go unnoticed due to this feature.

    were affected by the Wannacry ransom demanded in bitcoins. Similarly, the Petya
    cyberattack targeted the Cadbury chocolate factory in Tasmania. The criminals
    behind such attacks went unnoticed due to anonymity. Accounts cannot be frozen,
    and also nobody knows the real identity of the account holders. Therefore, regulation
    nodes are implemented to prevent this issue. These nodes are created to reveal
    the real identities of users. Suspicious and illicit transactions are automatically
    flagged and made to enable further investigation. True identities are revealed
    at regulation nodes. In this case, users are no longer allowed to mask their identity
    to surface the web. Even if ransomware is detected and deactivated, files are
    not restored, and therefore, framing appropriate laws in this regard is essential.

- en: Bitcoin money transfer has become the favorite mode of online transactions for
    criminals as well, due to its anonymity characteristic. Because of this, criminals
    are unable to be traced, and their identities remain undisclosed. However, the
    initial idea of Satoshi Nakamoto was very different, when he paved the way for
    the Bitcoin, as virtual currency. The reason for creating the Bitcoin and other
    alternative digital currencies was to provide an alternative and decentralized
    payment system. Ever since these cryptocurrencies were introduced, they have been
    used for illegal transactions as well, such as buying and selling illegal goods,
    drugs, and weapons (Kshetri & Voas 2017; Toyoda et al. 2017; Van Der Horst et
    al. 2017; Meiklejohn et al. 2013; Chadha & Kumar 2017). Most people think that
    cryptocurrency is outside the view of regulators and authorities to track down,
    but this is not true (Reid & Harrigan 2013; Wang et al. 2018; Toyoda et al. 2017;
    Van Der Horst et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2017; Yin et al. 2018).

    illegitimate activities conducted online through using digital currencies like
    Bitcoin. The fact is that, at this point in time, there is a limited ability for
    policymakers to regulate cryptocurrencies, due to the reason that cryptocurrencies
    have allowed criminals to take advantage and to use them for unlawful activities.

    The discussion on development of new approaches such as CP-HABE and Transaction
    and pattern analysis, and the way they can be utilized to detect illegal activities
    are the main aims of our chapter (Wang & Gao, 2018). Law enforcement authorities
    can use the applications mentioned in our chapter as surveillance mechanisms against
    the illicit activities such as selling drugs, weapons, and money laundering (Kshetri
    & Voas 2017; Toyoda et al. 2017; Van Der Horst et al. 2017; Chadha & Kumar 2017;
    Liu, Chen, et al. 2017). Tracking illegal activities and monitoring them through
    the afore applications can deter the illegal activities being carried on. This
    will, hopefully, curb the illicit transactions and unlawful trading in cryptocurrencies.

    Der Horst et al. 2017; Meiklejohn et al. 2013; Chadha & Kumar 2017). This is probably
    the reason why the street crime ratio has become smaller compared to the ratio
    of crimes handled online. There has been a migration of activities among people
    on trading drugs and illegal weapons online rather than on the streets. According
    to some authors, this has led to a reduction in violence occurring on streets
    (Christin, 2014). We have suggested in our present study that afore mentioned
    illegal activities can be prevented. The dark web can be prevented to a certain
    extent using applications mentioned in our chapter, and to “de-anonymize” the
    use of cryptocurrency to track the criminals.

    signature protocol (Narayanan et al., 2016), as it gives one, share of secret
    keys to each player while accomplishing the requirements of weightage. This can
    be used as a solution to anonymity and for securing Bitcoin wallets. Our chapter
    can also help, in the future, for analyzing the scale of illegal activities and
    quantifying and comparing the illegal activities conducted online versus similar
    activities on the street. This contribution does not quantify the scale of operations

    the governments have no control over the transactions being carried out using

    because these are used by criminals for illicit or undesirable activities. Digital
    currencies are considered as future currencies and have the potential to create
    a new revolution in the financial system of the economy. Therefore, restricting

    30 peer-reviewed scientific publications (that appeared in years 2011- 2018) describing
    experimental observations covering the legal and ethical aspects of cryptocurrencies
    like Bitcoin. We have suggested various methods to prevent tax evasion and money
    laundering, so that criminals are unable to take the profit out of criminal activities,
    and the regulators can regulate people trading in cryptocurrencies by making those
    concerned pay taxes and to disclose their income. Behavior and Transaction pattern
    analysis, KYC, CDD, and patching software can serve as anti-money laundering and
    counter-terrorism financing. There are various methods suggested in our chapter
    to help to mitigate the risks of theft or loss of private keys and to secure digital
    wallets in cryptocurrencies. As an example, the threshold signature scheme is
    used as the most efficient and optimal among other schemes for securing digital
    wallets. The SHA-256 is considered to provide the best form of encryption.

    We have mentioned how decentralization and anonymity could be used to track the
    criminals. Criminals can be traced through the combination of transaction and
    user network. This chapter has also mentioned methods to help with the prevention
    of drug marketing and other illegal activities such as trading of weapons and

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Post-trade securities settlements entered the electronic age between 1980 and
    2000\. The introduction of technologies such as secure electronic messaging, and
    improvements in database technology, enabled the inception of central securities
    depositories (CSDs) as trusted third parties or intermediaries within the securities
    settlements post-trade landscape. The study reported in this chapter has a focus
    on CSDs and the application of the blockchain technology to securities settlements.
    The objective is to develop a model for securities settlements using blockchain
    technology for a CSD, as currently, globally, no CSD has introduced a production-ready
    blockchain-based solution for securities settlements. A conceptual model was created
    from the reported literature that was evaluated by international post-trade securities
    professionals. The findings have resulted in the acceptance of the main components
    of the model, with a focus on the cost of the solution, and with the identification
    of prerequisites to such a solution (e.g., legal/regulatory enablement).

- en: The financial services industry has introduced new payment methods and services
    globally as new technologies have emerged. The use of mobile devices and banking
    applications (Apps) have made banking services more accessible that have improved
    the user experience. Electronic cash can now be sent on a peer-to-peer basis (transfer
    of value) without the need for a financial services intermediary (Nakamoto, 2008).
    Both the cash and stocks (e.g. securities traded on a financial exchange) have
    value and can be transferred typically between a buyer and a seller. A buyer of
    stock interacts directly with a seller of that stock or the issuer of stock (e.g.
    a company which issues either an equity or debt stock), having the ability in
    the network to view the transaction (Gibson and Kirk, 2016).

    digital asset that can be exchanged between two parties. Peer-to-peer transactions
    are the core type of transaction which are undertaken in the Bitcoin Blockchain,
    that makes use of a cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin, which uses cryptography to
    secure peer-to-peer transactions in a verifiable database that cannot be changed
    or amended without detection (Swanson, 2015). Typically, these transactions can
    take place without geographical restriction and without the need to use the traditional
    banking services to do so.

    against a cash payment between two parties. The opportunity to achieve this type
    of peer-to-peer transaction in securities settlements (whereby an equity or debt
    instrument for example can be exchanged for cash) has resulted in much hype within
    the financial services sector, as the potential for disintermediation of financial
    services intermediaries exists within the securities settlements ecosystem (Gartner,
    2020).

    expectations. It is important to note that, although the technology in its current
    form is relatively new, many of the cryptographic techniques employed were developed
    as early as the 1970s (KPMG, 2018). Therefore, since the technology is underpinned
    by well-known cryptographic techniques and has been applied in the Bitcoin ecosystem,
    its application in securities settlements needs to be further explored.

    have been replaced by virtual trading floors, however, whether virtual or physical,
    each provided the ability to connect investors wishing to buy and sell stocks
    (O'Connor, 2004). The processes, thereafter, allow the exchange of cash and securities
    after the trade in what is commonly known as the ‘post-trade’ process. The process
    has not undergone a significant change in the last 10 to 15 years despite various
    technological advances in Financial Services over this period.

    parties, such as Exchanges, Brokers, Dealers and Central Securities Depositories
    (CSDs). Karp (2015) highlights the potential to disrupt this particular sector
    of Financial Services through the use of Blockchain. CSDs, for example, are typically
    a trusted third party in most markets, which may only have one, or a small number
    of CSDs responsible for securities settlements in a specific market.

    given the actors, intermediaries and various settlement models employed; and how
    existing technology and processes assist in achieving a successful outcome. Once
    these were identified, the research explored what expectations of securities settlements
    exist amongst the primary role players in capital markets securities settlements
    (namely the regulators, issuers and investors). The research evaluated the most
    suitable approach to implement the new blockchain technology in an established
    securities settlement market. This provided a balanced evaluation, consisting
    of the inherent risks and the perceived benefits of available Blockchain technologies.
    A conceptual model was then presented and its acceptance evaluated, not only by
    CSDs, but also by the primary international role players in the industry.

    true benefits of the technology without introducing undue risk. The risk of failure
    of the technology of a CSD or a system which provides settlement services to a
    market can be catastrophic to the economies of countries. Thus, this research
    study aims to play a positive role in ensuring that robust models are considered,

    who are involved in this industry. Harris (2004) determines that stocks (equities
    or debt instruments for example) can take many forms, such as equities, commodities
    or debt instruments. Stocks can be bought and sold on exchanges through brokers
    who are members of an exchange. Harris (2004) further defines trading as a search

    stock (a term used interchangeably with security), then a number of days later
    (five days in South Africa), the seller receives payment for the stock while the
    buyer receives stock in the correct quantity, at the price already agreed (Harris,

    States and became fully electronic in 1980 (Atack and Neal, 2009; Gorham and Singh,
    2009). Electronic stock exchanges for the trading of securities require more efficient
    post-trade processing. Post-trade processing involves the processes of Clearing
    and Settlement. Loader (2002) describes clearing as the “the preparation through
    matching, recording and processing instructions of a transaction for settlement”
    and settlement as the “exchange of cash or assets in return for other assets”
    which includes the “exchange of legal ownership”. Gorham and Singh (2009) describe
    the process of manually clearing and settling matched trades as both tedious and
    complex and requires many institutions in financial markets to co-operate and
    work together. Managing the complexity of clearing and settlement, is also a key
    component of post-trade risk management, in order to ensure that a seller receives
    payment and the buyer receives the contractually agreed asset, thus mitigating
    credit and default risk (Gorham and Singh, 2009).

    Securities Depositories (CSDs), were introduced over twenty years ago in order
    to provide a centralised, safekeeping function for local markets and to expedite
    the processing of clearing and settlement in a centralised and electronic way
    (Loader, 2002). Local market issuers would typically have their entire issue in
    safekeeping at the CSD (Dickinson, 2015). Dickinson (2015) further elaborates
    that CSDs dematerialised physical stocks, which were previously kept as physical
    certificates either at investors, issuers or custodians. These stocks were prone
    to loss, damage and theft in addition to being expensive to store.

    without trusted third parties. A Central Securities Depository (CSD) is the de
    facto trusted third party for securities settlement in a given market. Thus, a
    CSD, as a trusted third party could become irrelevant, should this technology
    introduce a fundamentally new set of rules, which could determine how capital
    market settlements take place, perhaps without the need for a CSD (Karp, 2015).

    new prototypes or proof of concepts are announced by varying participants in capital

    an established industry while discarding a proven, even dominant incumbent. Since
    CSDs are ‘dominant’ in given markets (there are normally one or two CSDs per market),
    they seem to be a prime use case for a disruptive technology such as Blockchain,
    as it is the ‘trusted third party’ in most markets. CSDs are typically found in
    the middle of the post-trade settlement processes in capital markets between multiple
    entities/intermediaries, although at the end of the post trade process. This disruptive
    technology therefore provides a differentiating opportunity to eliminate the need
    for a dominant intermediary, such as a CSD and enable peer-to-peer settled transactions
    between buyers and sellers of given stocks. The observation could also be that
    a CSD is the obvious starting point to enable the technology to, in essence, disrupt
    itself.

    services (The Economist, 2014). This means that all financial service providers
    within the supply chain of a securities settlement transaction are potential points
    of disintermediation, including central banks, brokerages, custodian banks and
    CSDs. Disintermediation, however, would only take place if there are differentiating
    factors the technology could provide, which could lower cost, create efficiencies
    and increase information security (Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, 2019).
    At the time of writing, no disintermediation of any of the above-mentioned entities
    had taken place, even though the technology has been in use since 2008\. There
    are many initiatives underway throughout the spectrum of participants globally
    in the capital markets, but none have successfully implemented the technology
    in post-trade securities settlement on an end to end basis (Committee on Capital
    Markets Regulation, 2019).

    be the key as to why there has been little disruption to date in post-trade securities
    settlement. It is important to note that there is much experimentation still taking
    place across the spectrum of intermediaries in capital markets, most of them accompanied
    by press releases about joint ventures with new fintech and established companies
    alike. This experimentation is necessary to understand the technology; however,
    the experimentation is not driven on a market-wide scale with a market-wide design
    to achieve common goals.

    within the role of a CSD. Due to the physical nature of securities prior to dematerialisation,
    custodianship was sought by investors to keep their securities safe, effectively
    creating ‘indirect asset holdings’ (Eva, 2015). Advances in technology resulting
    in electronic securities holdings and in the use of CSDs, however, did not result
    in an elimination of indirect holdings, even though it significantly reduced risk
    and increased efficiencies. Eva (2015) mentions that the converse results in an
    increased number of indirect holdings at one or multiple custodians who administer

    securities settlement stable, the custody chains have the ability to modify rights
    of investors, as there are multiple terms and conditions between custodians and
    their sub-custodians, which could be less beneficial for an investor (Eva, 2015).

    has been intermediated by between one and three custodians, before the record
    of ownership is realised at the CSD. Furthermore, rights of the investor have
    been altered within this procedure, thus leading to a case of ‘indirect holding’
    for the ultimate investor (Eva, 2015). In addition, buyers and sellers each have
    their own custody arrangements. Custody services are typically offered as one
    service within a portfolio of services including tax, cash management, investment
    advice and brokerage; either only in a domestic market or in multiple geographic
    regions (European Central Bank, 2007). Settlement finality, which is supported
    by legal frameworks in each country, is a key component in the current settlement

    a securities account at a custodian or at a CSD (Mori, 2016).

    serve a national market and play an important role for national regulators of
    a given country (European Central Bank, 2007) and differ subtly in their implementation
    in different countries (Euroclear and Oliver Wyman, 2016). Euroclear and Wyman
    (2016) further clarify that this implies that there is a sovereign (i.e. country
    specific) requirement with regard to CSDs, as regulators would require direct
    supervision, oversight and tailored reporting based on individual market requirements.

    market infrastructures in the smooth functioning of capital markets, not only
    from a securities settlement perspective, but also for market conduct reasons
    (Euroclear and Wyman, 2016). Should a CSD experience distress or a failure because
    of the complexity and interconnectedness within capital markets, this would cause
    significant disruption to the wider financial system and to economic activity.
    According to Brennan and Lunn (2016), CSDs, a centralised ledger and by virtue
    of its current technology a record-keeping structure, are not immutable and are
    susceptible to censorship, forgery or transaction reversals. It is important to
    note that although the CSD record is not immutable, there are other logical and
    physical security controls in place which govern information security and data
    protection and have done so successfully. Given that CSDs also occupy a dominant
    position in a given market, the CSD system is required to interoperate with those
    of the various intermediaries and exchanges in local markets with pre-defined

    consortiums comprising banks, market infrastructures and exchanges, focused on
    permissioned DLT solutions which have been formed as described by the World Federation
    of Exchanges (2016). These include R3 CEV, Hyperledger and the Post-Trade Distributed

- en: It is important to consider the nature of the questions in the survey which
    was later completed by respondents. Since a conceptual model was developed based
    on a technology, not yet fully proven in a production capacity, respondents are
    likely to provide their opinion rather than specific numeric or nominal answers.
    The design of the questionnaire therefore was of paramount importance and the
    sections discussed earlier, were used as a guideline to assist respondents. All
    questions were grounded in the literature review of the study. The questionnaire
    (in Appendix A) was sent to the target audience and was analysed using the Statistica
    software package to produce statistical results. In addition, Dr Danie Venter,
    a Nelson Mandela University statistical consultant was engaged to produce and
    analyse the statistical results.

    an experienced individual to select units of the sample based on personal judgement
    on the most appropriate characteristics of the sample member. Given the information

    major findings are summarised into various themes and discussed below.

- en: Cost
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most consistent finding throughout the study relates to the Cost factor
    which, with an acceptable Cronbach Alpha score, seems to be more important due
    to the increased levels of understanding of the technology and is highly correlated
    to both Time to Market and the model used for a DLT solution in Securities Settlement.
    In addition, pre-requisites were identified such as additional technology components,
    legal and regulatory requirements, new interface requirements and integration
    to incumbents in inferential ranking. As each of these factors bears a cost, the
    inclusion of a cost consequence in the inferential ranking was important and relevant.
    This information provides both a model for future implementation of the technology
    in relation to cost considerations, as well as potential reasons why the technology
    has not yet been successfully implemented in a production environment.

    also had an acceptable Cronbach Alpha score and ranked the highest in terms of
    inferential ranking on a group and individual question basis. Furthermore, this
    factor provided large statistical evidence and is likely to be of practical use.
    The primary finding here is that there needs to be a clear legal and regulatory
    framework, which precedes the building of a model such as this. This in essence
    means that this factor also becomes a key success factor in the building of these
    solutions for post-trade securities settlement.

    which delivers the technology in a faster time to market. Furthermore, the indications
    from the open questions is that suitable global solutions are still at least a

    indicate that the change in this technology will be an evolutionary change, they
    support the notion that the Blockchain technology is, indeed suitable for securities
    settlements. Further to this, the narrative of collaborative evolutionary challengers
    is created from the findings of this study as an approach to manage the implementation
    of so-called disruptive technology (including DLT/Blockchain) in established markets.
    To explain this, the word ‘disruptive’ is associated with Blockchain. This association
    does the adoption of the technology in established markets no favours in terms
    of practical implementation of the technology, no matter what the purported benefits
    of the technology are. Incumbents are likely to develop technology isolation and
    thus not have industry support or alternatively focus on keeping current technology
    in place due to the threat of disruption.

    in this research, such as F4 (DLT for securities settlements) and F10 (the convergence
    of cryptocurrency and traditional settlements and technology components) point
    to a collaborative and inclusive approach to developing new technology models
    for the market. Although the aforementioned had acceptable Cronbach alpha values,
    essentially validating the conceptual model, the cash settlement (as a key component
    of the model) was not validated. Furthermore, cash settlement proved to be divisive
    in the open questions. This leads to the conclusion that cash settlement would
    need to be included as part of the settlements process; and ultimately would need
    to be solved for either in parallel to a securities settlement or prior to it.

    The need to interoperate and collaborate with both new technology, industry incumbents
    and regulators on an industry-scale will be necessary in order to see timely adoption
    of new technology. This narrative needs to be overlaid with the three key themes
    identified (Cost, Legal/Regulatory requirements and Time to Market) in a collaborative
    approach, will be the primary success factors responsible for implementing a model.
    In summary, an industry-wide business case would need to be concluded before a
    model such as this can be implemented successfully. Furthermore, the approach
    of introducing these new technologies should be guided with the concept developed
    here of collaborative evolutionary challengers instead of that of isolated disruptive
    fintech.

    with the financial industry (The Economist, 2014). All financial service providers,
    within the supply chain of a securities settlement transaction, are potential
    points of disintermediation, including CSDs. Blockchain technology is a suitable
    platform for the securities settlements. The implementation of the proposed conceptual
    model using Blockchain technologies requires the collaboration of various role-players
    and stakeholders and also requires international collaboration. Presently, a prototype
    blockchain based application, using the Ethereum platform, is being developed
    for research purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The prototype Blockchain project for securities settlement requires market co-ordination
    and planning with regulators, intermediaries, issuers and investors, in order
    to validate the proposed sovereign distributed securities depository conceptual
    model. The prototype uses an Ethereum blockchain to store the data. Here, a detailed
    analysis of the requirements from all stakeholders is required. Decisions on how
    to model the value chain and manage the requirements elicitation process with
    all stakeholders are managed by the NMU research team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The proposed Blockchain application consists of three different components.
    The first component is the smart contract(s), which runs on an Ethereum Virtual
    Machine. The smart contract component is written in Solidity, the current language
    used on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Decisions need to be made on how and what
    data need to be stored on the SDSD Blockchain, taking into consideration that
    some data may be better stored in a private database and other data on a Blockchain.
    The modelling of the proposed application is crucial and requires careful planning.
    Once the code is placed on a blockchain, it is there forever. The challenge in
    the smart contract component is not only planning what information is stored,
    but also how the data and information are stored. Special attention needs to be
    given to the storage of data and information as the developers are thinking of
    classes, as used in programming, which would likely come with an additional cost.
    The goal is to store enough data and information on the blockchain for the public
    to see what is happening in the process, but not to include additional data and
    information to leak or display any sensitive or confidential data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second component is the protocol for communicating between the blockchain
    and the user frontends or user interfaces. Once the model is designed and the
    smart contract is created, a protocol needs to be created. The protocol will dictate
    how, when and what needs to be written to the blockchain or retrieved from the
    blockchain. Creating the protocol involves ensuring that the backend programme
    can extract enough information from the blockchain to show relevant information
    to the user of the frontend system. Blockchain data structures are highly incompatible
    with other programming languages. It is thus important to create a simple way
    of exchanging the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final component is the applications that provide user interfaces with the
    blockchain and presents the results. Programmes using any conventional programming
    language will be developed for all stakeholders that will make use of a blockchain
    to store and read data, as opposed to text files, databases, network requests,
    etc. The system needs to make use of the protocol to read relevant information,
    parse it and show the required information to the user. The programmes need to
    write to the blockchain and read from the blockchain to display updates in the
    value chain and write updates to the blockchain managing the SDSD process.

    explained as instead of incumbent’s business models being threatened, incumbents
    are offering cryptocurrency services (with similar safeguards and governance as
    are offered in traditional securities settlements) and directly competing with
    the fintech companies who are trying to disrupt them. This is an indirect result

    important step as per this research to seeing the traditional Capital Markets
    moving to a Distributed Ledger platform. Future research need to focus on the
    implementation of CBDC and securities on the same or an interoperable chain which
    represent the most viable opportunity for realizing the benefits of the said technology
    in the industry.
