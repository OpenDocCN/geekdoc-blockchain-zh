    Taking his degree in 2005, he saw few opportunities in Pakistan, so he concocted
    a bold plan to obtain a fellowship at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science
    in Stockholm. The Swedes were happy to have him but offered no financial support.

    and, with Martin Casado, an author of the canonical “open-flow” software-defined
    networking (SDN) paper. Today he is chief technical officer of TimescaleDB, an
    acclaimed open-source time-series database. Ali thanks Freedman for “thinking
    through every detail of various distributed systems problems with me. I learned

    the pioneering network virtualization firm Nicira, which he sold to VMWare for
    $1.2 billion. Ben Horowitz, the son of the truth-telling provocateur David Horowitz,
    had made his fortune inventing software at VMWare, and Casado eventually joined
    him as a venture partner at Andreessen Horowitz.

    that engulfed Ali was in the process of transforming the network. It changed from
    a seven-layer structure dominated by hardware capabilities to a two-layer structure
    largely defined by software mimicry of hardware capabilities. Like Stephenson’s
    Hiro and the pseudonymous Satoshi, Ali lived in a realm where it was possible
    to break away from the limitations of the material world into the electronic night
    and create a metaverse that fulfilled your dreams.

    are controlled by higher functions. At the bottom is the physical layer, the fiber-optic
    lines, microwave oscillators, mixers, 1550- and 900-nanometer lasers, photodetectors,
    silicon routers, erbium-doped amplifiers, and twisted-pair telephone wires, antennas,
    coaxial cables—the list is endless—that carry the data packets across the network
    at the behest of the layers above it. Hard to design and build, this layer of
    hardware devices is at the heart of the miracle of modern electronics. But by
    the time Ali was studying at Princeton, much of the industry was ignoring hardware
    to build Turing machines in the ether.

    for granted and build castles in the sky—in computer language, “stacks”—that can
    imitate hardware and transcend it in virtual threads and cores and chains. But
    the evolution from micro-matter to metaverse begins with the seven-layer netplex
    scheme of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of the International Standards
    Organization.

    where hardware becomes “firmware” and software that define the electrical specifications,
    timing rules, and electron-photon conversions that enable the transmission of
    information across a link from one node or computational address to the next.
    Switches operate here at layer two, passing packets only to the next node. Local
    area networks such as Ethernet or WiFi function at this level. If you shun the
    highways of the Internet, you can live your life transmitting your bits and bytes
    across the datalink layers, layer two.

    with the transport layer (layer four) to establish the end-to-end links that constitute
    the TCP/IP Internet Protocols. This is the entire system of IP addresses and Transport
    Control Protocol traffic shuffles that comprise the connections from end to end
    across the Net. Layer three does the headers on the packets, the identities and
    addresses; layer four does the actual transmission and reception of data packets
    and traffic management, load balancing and acks (I got it!) and naks (I’m still
    waiting) that assure connections. Layers three and four tend to be a bastion of
    central powers, where governments and their intelligence arms chase down domain
    names and addresses, entities such as ICANN and even the UN’s ITU. When they discover
    a Silk Road or perhaps an Alpha Bay, they track it down over layer three.

    interfaces, windows, formats, operating systems, and so on. These are summed up
    in the ingenious schemes of hyperlinks (click on a word and go to a new page)
    and universal resource locators (URLs) addresses. Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Geneva
    invented them in 1989 as part of his World Wide Web. Berners-Lee wanted to make
    all data linkable into one Web, a skein of tools that made it easy to set up a
    Web page of “shared creative collaborative space where everyone could play together.”

    up the handset and listen for a dial tone (physical layer signal), now often simulated;
    dial a number (every digit moves the call another link closer to the destination);
    listen for the ringtone (signifying a network connection and transport of signals).
    By the time you get someone on the line, you have gone through the first four
    layers of the OSI stack. Then your “hello” begins a session, the choice of English
    defines the presentation, the conversation constitutes the application layer,
    and the hang-up ends the session.

    triumphalist imagines that it is all in his head, the genius of networking is
    dualistic. Animated by trillions upon trillions of microchip transistors, vias,
    and traces, the physical layer is ultimately as opaque and unfathomable as it
    is ingenious and indispensable. Software logic proliferates in a hierarchy above

    that when he had completed the job, though, the computer left him puzzled. In
    Pakistan at the turn of the twenty-first century, a computer was like the proverbial
    “car in the jungle.” A car might offer attractive features—light, heat, air-conditioning,
    shelter, protection—but a car becomes really exciting only in conjunction with
    roads. Ali’s computer fully enthralled him and changed his life only when he acquired

    forms, a secure-sockets layer enabling safe commercial links across the Net, and

    the computing establishment. In the following five years, a spate of IPOs, from

    Microsoft was able to quell the Netscape challenge by acquiring the Spyglass browser.
    The leading designers of Spyglass, as it happened, were Netscape’s Andreessen

    and Airbnb, nearly all of them had private market caps higher than Netscape’s
    in its IPO. Most were less interested in going public than merging with a mammoth
    like Google/Alphabet or Facebook. Unlike the appreciation of earlier Internet
    companies such as Microsoft and Netscape, the appreciation of unicorns would not
    chiefly benefit the public. The returns (and burn rates) flowed mostly to the
    venture capitalists who held them and the leviathans that bought some of the best
