    It’s a hugely tricky question, as the internet morphs every 15–20 years and the
    ValueWeb is just the start of this generation of change. As mentioned in the opening
    chapter, the ValueWeb is the building block of the third generation internet,
    Web 3.0, the Internet of Value. I call it the ValueWeb, as this generation changes
    everything when it comes to money and trade, as well as the things we value in
    life and relationships. It is a clear shift from the first and second web generations.

    the Internet of Society. Web 1.0 was all about building the World Wide Web, whilst
    Web 2.0 was focused upon social networking. Web 3.0 is the Internet of Value,
    and will take at least the next decade to build, create and deploy. That is why
    I often say that traditional banks have a decade to change—but they had better
    start now, because if they wait until they can see the change occurring, it will
    be too late. Eventually, after the ValueWeb has been created, we will move on
    to what I call the Internet of Life, where we won’t even think of the internet
    as something separate. We won’t think about digital or mobile or being online;
    we will just be immersed in the network, which will have become some sort of sixth
    sense.

    I place them as the first internet-based email was sent on ARPANET in 1971; the
    first instant message was sent in 1992; and the first cryptocurrency that worked,
    Satoshi Nakamoto’s bitcoin, went live in 2009\. What you see in these generational
    developments are years of building the capability that then seems to appear overnight.
    Twenty years or more of building the internet’s plumbing took place before the
    first website appeared but, once it did, it took only four more years for Amazon
    and eBay to start selling books and organising auctions. The first instant message
    was sent in 1992 by AOL’s vice-chairman Ted Leonsis, but it took 12 more years
    before Mark Zuckerberg began working on Facebook, and almost five more before
    they reached 100 million users.

    is that each generation of the internet’s key stages—Internet, Web 2.0, ValueWeb,
    Life—takes around 10–20 years of gestation technologies before it hits Main Street—and
    the ValueWeb is in its early days. We have 5–10 years before it delivers and,
    during that time, other components of the ValueWeb have to come together. For
    example, we are talking about machine-to-machine commerce (M2M). M2M commerce
    is the trade that takes place in the Internet of Things, with many people believing
    the Internet of Things is Web 3.0, although I claim that space is the ValueWeb.
  prefs: []

    a cheap, real-time infrastructure that supports such things. You cannot have an
    Internet of Things if these *things* have identities that cannot be traced. You
    cannot have an Internet of Things, if the *things* cannot be associated with their
    masters in a cheap and easy, real-time way. This is why the shared ledger underpinning
    the Internet of Things, driven by the ValueWeb, is going to be key. This is the
    reason why the ValueWeb is critical, as you cannot develop next phase services
    without it.

    like this. The ValueWeb develops alongside the Internet of Things, enabling machines
    to trade with machines. This will allow the refrigerator to exchange value with
    the grocery store through a registration of the refrigerator on the owner’s identity,
    which will be on someone’s shared ledger of trusted identities that might be blockchain
    based. This identity profile attaches that device’s billing account to the wallet
    of its owner. The owner will get cloud-based updates in real-time of the refrigerator’s
    purchases. They will also see what their car, television and other devices are
    ordering in real-time. This will all run on a shared infrastructure, which will
    be a cloud-based, shared ledger of trust.

    will develop. This development is hinged upon secure designs and patents, as it
    means the supply chain collapses from goods being imported from overseas to goods
    being printed at home or in the local workshop. Right now, 3D printers can easily
    print anything, from jewellery to clothing to guns, to even printing houses and
    body parts.

    ideas through gamification. A great example is the story of Foldit.

    2011 when the players solved an AIDS puzzle in weeks that had baffled scientists

    causes an AIDS-like disease in monkeys worked in just three weeks. There are other

    that people would be able talk to their computers, and to give then commands just
    by using their voice by 2009\. In 2011, Apple launched the iPhone with Siri and
    was soon followed by Google launching Google Now. These systems have been developing
    since 2009\. In 2005, Kurzweil predicted that real-time language translation would
    be available to all, where words spoken in a foreign language would be translated
    into text in our native language. Kurzweil expected this to be available by the
    2010s. Microsoft Skype Translate and Google Translate have achieved this.

    biggest bank, unveiled robot employees to work in their branches in April 2015\.
    The robot is called Nao, a 58 centimetre (1’ 11”) tall humanoid equipped with
    a camera on the forehead and programmed to speak 19 languages. He analyses customers’
    emotions from their facial expressions and tone of voice, which allows the robot
    to greet customers and ask which services they need.

    reality will feel a hundred percent real. Just like the Holodeck in *Star Trek*,
    we will enter alternative worlds that are created where we can touch, feel and
    smell the reality. By the 2040s, non-biological intelligence will be a billion
    times more capable than biological intelligence (i.e., you and I) and we will
    multiply our intelligence a billion-fold by linking wirelessly from our neocortex
    to a synthetic neocortex in the cloud.
