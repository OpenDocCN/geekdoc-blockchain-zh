    advocacy and education; communicating what is bitcoin; why it is important; what

    making them aware of what bitcoin is able to do for them. Then there’s also Bitcoin
    Core for the Open Source Software Project and Gavin Andersen was the lead developer
    for a long time. He’s now stepped out of the role of lead developer, but the Foundation
    was financing the salaries of a few key people to support the development of the

    regulations in a way that will proceed positively.

    Core）这个开源软件项目，加文·安德森（Gavin Andersen）长时间担任首席开发者。他现在退出了首席开发者的角色，但基金会一直在资助一些关键人员的薪水，以支持开源协议的发展。然后最后一个部分是政策，这是关注政府如何寻求对此进行监管，并试图以积极的方式影响这些法规的部分。

    possible way to make everyone happy, and so you’ve got some very different organisations.

    familiar with ChangeTip, but they’re focused on micro transactions, which, because
    most of the developing world cannot use the current payment systems, is going
    to be a key. Most of the developing world cannot use credit cards. If you have
    a credit card in Africa and you go online to purchase something, the merchant
    and the payment infrastructure and fraud detecting services have to trust you.
    The problem is that they more or less systematically deny anyone from Africa from
    being able to buy anything with a credit card. It’s a trustless payment system.
    In this context, I think it is very compelling for allowing those excluded to
    be included. Bitcoin, or something like it, will allow the other 70 percent of
    the planet to participate in the internet economy, which is a great thing for
    anyone doing business online.

    it is the Internet of Information. It’s made possible because of the communications’
    protocol TCP/IP. The problem is that you cannot transact value over TCP/IP without
    a trusted counterparty or intermediary. What Satoshi solved was the issue of a
    double-spend. If I sent you an email with a picture attached to it, how do you
    know when you receive it that I didn’t keep a copy for myself or sent it to four
    other people at the same time? TCP/IP is a protocol designed for that. What Satoshi
    Nakamoto has achieved is that he’s created a protocol that permits the transmission
    of value, in any form. That is a revolutionary event. Now, does bitcoin’s blockchain
    end up being the successful platform for all of that activity? I don’t know, but
    do I think that it’s interesting and dependable? I think bitcoin, as a non-sovereign,
    math-based currency, is very interesting. It’s interesting from so many views.
    For example, from the developing world, in places like Russia and Ukraine today,

- en: They’re categorically untrue. I’ll give you a really good example. Take my pal
    Patrick Byrne, the CEO and chairman of Overstock. About a year ago, he was saying
    he had no interest in cryptocurrencies or in bitcoin. Well, somebody convinced
    him that there were pockets of bitcoin all over the place that couldn’t be spent
    anywhere. So he said, let’s go after those pockets of bitcoin and sell them garden
    furniture. This was a marketing ploy. He announced, “Overstock will accept bitcoins.”
    The press loved it. But Overstock wasn’t “accepting” bitcoins, because every sale
    had to go through Coinbase. What’s more, Patrick was smart enough to have negotiated
    with Coinbase that he wouldn’t have to pay a commission on the currency conversion.
    So “accepting” bitcoin didn’t cost him anything. The very first day he racked
    up $133,000 worth of bitcoin-driven sales. It looked like he was supporting the
    bitcoin community, so the bitcoin community supported him. Within three months,
    however, his bitcoin-driven sales were down to $7,000 a day. Why? Because the
    people who had pockets of bitcoin and no place to spend them, had spent them.
    And they didn’t buy back in. They saw no reason to buy any more bitcoins simply
    to use them to purchase pillowcases and garden furniture priced in dollars at
    Overstock. That’s significant. Think about it. How is there any logical reason
    for anybody to take dollars to buy bitcoins to pay for things priced in dollars?
    It adds no value and, in fact, creates extra expense. So, his sales dropped down
    to $7,000 a day. He then announced that he would accept bitcoin worldwide and
    his sales went up to $8,000 a day. But they have since fallen again. He has even
    said publicly, there is no international interest in bitcoin. None.

  zh: 这些说法绝对不属实。我给你举个很好的例子。拿我朋友帕特里克·伯恩来说，他是Overstock的CEO兼董事长。大约一年前，他说他对加密货币或比特币不感兴趣。然后，有人说服他，说比特币遍布各地，但无法在任何地方使用。于是他说，让我们去找到这些比特币并将它们兑换成花园家具出售。这是一个营销策略。他宣布：“Overstock将接受比特币。”媒体很喜欢。但实际上Overstock并没有“接受”比特币，因为每笔销售都必须通过Coinbase进行。更重要的是，帕特里克足够聪明，与Coinbase协商过，他不必支付货币转换的佣金。因此，“接受”比特币对他来说没有成本。第一天他就实现了价值$133,000的比特币驱动销售额。看起来他在支持比特币社区，所以比特币社区也支持他。然而，仅仅三个月后，他由比特币驱动的销售额下降到每天$7,000。为什么？因为那些拥有比特币但无处可花的人已经花掉了它们。他们没有再购买。他们认为没必要再购买比特币，只是为了用它们购买Overstock以美元计价的枕套和花园家具。这很重要。想想看。有什么逻辑理由让任何人拿美元购买比特币，然后用它们购买以美元计价的东西？这没有增加价值，事实上，只是增加了额外的费用。因此，他的销售额降至每天$7,000。然后他宣布将在全球范围内接受比特币，他的销售额上升到每天$8,000。但是后来销售额再次下降。他甚至公开表示，没有人对比特币感兴趣。一点儿都没有。
- en: Shortly after admitting worldwide disinterest, he filed a report with the SEC
    which received no media attention whatsoever. He’d decided to hold on to 10 percent
    of all his bitcoin sales. It means that Coinbase now converts 90 percent and sends
    him the remaining 10 percent. So he’s holding onto $700 a day worth of bitcoin
    business, which he says he is giving to his staff as bonuses. (By the way, the
    staff apparently insisted they put a bitcoin ATM in the lobby of the building
    in Utah so they could cash out right away.) Now, with $7,000 a day of bitcoin-driven
    sales, he’s saving his three percent Visa and Mastercard fees. That’s $210\. Okay,
    $210 a day times 365 adds up. Except, he told the SEC that, in order to integrate
    the 10 percent he holds, he must integrate $700 a day into his bookkeeping for
    tax purposes. That’s not so easy, because bitcoin is considered property by the
    tax people, which means there are both capital gains and capital loss calculations
    on each bitcoin. So far, he told the SEC, for the privilege of keeping a few bitcoins
    on his books, it has cost him $400,000\. Next, Patrick said in that SEC filing,
    he would probably have to spend another $400,000 to make his bookkeeping fully
    compatible. So, he’s spending $800,000 to save $210 a day. It will take him almost
    ten years to get his money back. Explain to me how this is a good idea, how this
    is sustainable, how this makes any sense at all.

  zh: 不久之后，尽管全球对此不感兴趣，他向证券交易委员会提交了一份报告，但没有得到任何媒体关注。他决定保留自己所有比特币销售的10％。这意味着 Coinbase
    现在会将 90％ 转换并将剩余的 10％ 发送给他。所以他每天都持有价值 $700 的比特币业务，他说他会把这笔钱作为奖金发给他的员工。（顺便说一句，员工显然坚持要在犹他州的大厦大堂放一个比特币
    ATM，这样他们就可以立即兑现。）现在，每天有 $7,000 的比特币驱动销售，他在节省三分之一的 Visa 和 Mastercard 费用。这是 $210。好吧，每天
    $210 乘以 365 加起来。除此之外，他告诉证券交易委员会，为了整合他持有的 10％，他必须将每天 $700 整合到他的账簿中以便税务目的。这并不容易，因为比特币被税务部门视为财产，这意味着每个比特币都需要进行资本增值和资本损失的计算。到目前为止，他告诉证券交易委员会，为了保留一些比特币在账簿上的特权，他花了
    $400,000。接着，Patrick 在那份证券交易委员会的申报中说，他可能还需要花另外 $400,000 才能使他的记账完全兼容。所以，他花了 $800,000
    来节省每天 $210。他将花费近十年的时间才能收回成本。请告诉我，这是一个好主意吗？这是可持续的吗？这有任何意义吗？

    with a bank like Cross River Bank. In that scenario, Ripple connects SEPA to ACH
    and works with SWIFT’s messaging layer— so another bank in the US or a bank in
    Europe could actually use Cross River Bank or Fidor Bank as its “correspondent”

    They were also sceptical as to whether they would actually get the products they

    Days”. When you did select that payment method, instead of Visa or MasterCard,
    you just entered your name, address and date of birth. That was all the information
    we needed. Based on that limited information we were able to take that data, perform
    the risk assessment and give a “yes” or “no” answer within a second. If the answer
    was “yes”, then the merchant was paid there and then, no matter what happened.

    Visa 或 MasterCard 那样。这就是我们所需要的所有信息。基于这些有限的信息，我们能够对数据进行风险评估，并在一秒钟内给出“是”或“否”的答复。如果答复是“是”，那么商家就会立即收到款项，不管发生了什么。这意味着他们可以放心地立即将货物发运给客户，而客户则可以在最多14天后支付款项。

    struggled to set up and maintain multiple banking relations in Europe for their
    international trading activity. Whilst we were having these meetings with them
    to talk about investment management, succession planning, corporate finance and
    many other things, they spent a lot of the time complaining about the relationships
    they had with banks. So we identified that banking fragmentation in Europe in
    itself was one of the trading barriers for the European Union. The frustration
    was enormous. I could relate to my own experience, I have had to open bank accounts
    with different banks in each one of the six European countries where I have lived.
    Why do we have to do that, and why do we have to maintain so many banking relations?
    We have to become treasurers in our own right, and that’s not to mention the inconvenience.

    our deposits to feed their balance sheet—they want that to be stable. Banks look
    at cash management, which includes payments, current accounts and so on—as an
    appeal product; for them, it is a necessary evil to attract money to the balance
    sheet, so that they can carry on creditor activities. These two functions of the
    bank, cash and credit, are together as a legal entity in every bank, the restrictions
    applied to the credit function are also applied to the cash management function—as
    such, we have a fragmented banking industry in Europe. If we break the bank in
    two—which is actually what regulation is intending to do—we create a new generation
    of banking, thanks to the appearance of a new banking entity, exclusive to cash
    management. Not bound to a single country, this entity can now spread geographically
    over a number of countries. We created ipagoo to prove that this was possible.

    of origin. There are also 2.5 million Europeans changing country each year. There
    are 2.4 million businesses that have a presence in more than one country. Banking
    fragmentation obliges all those individuals and businesses to open new accounts
    every year. It is not just about switching, it’s about starting a new relationship.

- en: We are in a different category. Funding circle is a good example, as they are
    addressing a specific need, so they are very good at providing credit to specific
    companies in a specific way. They represent a niche, specialised player. They
    represent the disintegration of banking services that you mention in your book.
    Traditional retail banks pretend to be big supermarkets of everything within a
    single brand. But they cannot be good at everything, its impossible. Banks still
    pretend to be good at everything. This model is dead and Funding Circle and other
    niche players are proof of that. However, the problem for the end customer is
    that now he is facing hundreds, if not thousands, of new providers, so consumers
    need an aggregator. The natural aggregation layer is cash management. Whether
    you are going to receive or invest money from Funding Circle, you need a current
    account. We are the cash management bank for Europe, underneath which anyone of
    those new, specialised providers can access clients to be funded or offered credit
    to. We will work in open architecture—ipagoo is going to start connecting with
    third-party providers or investment banks that offer AAA cash funds and others.
    Even if you live in the UK, you can actually do business with a German bank you
    have never heard of before. We become the distribution channel, in the same way
    that eBay have merchants that only exist in eBay. We think that in the future
    some banks will evolve to distribute exclusively through us, where they can reach
    500 million people in Europe rather than be constrained to the country where they
    are today.

  zh: 我们处于一个不同的类别。Funding Circle是一个很好的例子，因为他们正在解决一个特定的需求，所以他们非常擅长以一种特定的方式向特定公司提供信贷。他们代表着一个利基、专业化的参与者。他们代表了你在书中提到的银行服务的分解。传统的零售银行假装自己是单一品牌内所有事物的大型超市。但他们不可能在所有事情上都做得好，这是不可能的。银行仍然假装自己在所有方面都很擅长。这个模式已经死了，而Funding
    Circle和其他利基参与者则证明了这一点。然而，对于最终客户来说，现在他面临着数百，甚至数千家新的提供者，因此消费者需要一个聚合器。自然的聚合层是现金管理。无论你是从Funding
    Circle收到还是投资资金，你都需要一个活期账户。我们是欧洲的现金管理银行，任何这些新的、专业化的提供者都可以通过我们来接触客户，以获得资金或提供信贷。我们将采用开放式架构——ipagoo将开始与提供AAA现金基金和其他服务的第三方提供者或投资银行建立联系。即使你住在英国，你也可以与以前从未听说过的德国银行做生意。我们成为了分销渠道，就像eBay有一些只存在于eBay上的商家一样。我们认为未来一些银行将会演变成仅通过我们来分销，这样他们就可以触及到5亿欧洲人口，而不仅仅局限于今天所在的国家。

  zh: '**还有其他我们没有涵盖到的内容吗？**'
- en: Yes, I think there is something else to mention regarding ipagoo. ipagoo is
    what we describe as very disruptive—it really breaks the system-banking model.
    Each bank is a factory of products through the balance sheet and distribution
    channel through the cash management—in that it remains in a single country. So
    for example, any large banking group like HSBC or Barclays have a collection of
    banks, one in each country. So, what is the strategy for any bank in Europe in
    terms of growth? Some of them have no strategy, especially as they don’t have
    the deep pockets required to go out and buy other banks or organically opening
    new subsidiaries— but even these two models we know don’t work very well. So ipagoo
    is disruptive in the sense that it allows a traditional bank in Europe, with a
    single balance sheet in a single country, to become European and serve 500 million
    people. Within banking, ipagoo represents that innovation. Banks become efficient.
    You reduce your distribution costs much more. That is fundamentally different
    from today’s model of fragmented balance sheets and difficult to manage. What
    I am saying is that no bank will resist the need to do this. The digitilisation
    of the banking industry as it has been preached so far has nothing to do with
    being innovative—banks are simply trying to reduce the cost of distribution by
    reducing the cost and access to the client. Digitalisation is one thing—changing
    your model to achieve tremendous efficiency and flexibility that unleashes innovation
    in such an advanced way is another.

  zh: 是的，我认为还有一些关于ipagoo的事情需要提及。ipagoo 是我们描述的非常具有颠覆性的东西——它真正打破了银行模式。每家银行都是通过资产负债表和现金管理渠道作为产品工厂——这仍然在单个国家内。所以例如，像汇丰或巴克莱这样的任何大型银行集团都有一系列银行，每个国家都有一个。那么，欧洲银行的增长战略是什么？其中一些银行没有战略，特别是因为他们没有足够的资金去收购其他银行或有机地开设新子公司——但即使这两种模式我们知道也不是很有效。所以
    ipagoo 在这个意义上是具有颠覆性的，它允许欧洲的传统银行，在一个国家的单一资产负债表的基础上，成为欧洲化并为5亿人提供服务。在银行业内，ipagoo
    代表了创新。银行变得更加高效。你可以大大降低分销成本。这与今天的碎片化资产负债表和难以管理的模式根本不同。我要说的是，没有一家银行会抵制这种需要。银行业的数字化，就像迄今为止一直被宣传的那样，与创新无关——银行只是试图通过降低成本和客户接触成本来降低分销成本。数字化是一回事——改变你的模式以实现巨大的效率和灵活性，从而以如此先进的方式释放创新，是另一回事。

- en: I think now it’s down to superior analytics and risk management, but initially
    I think it was because we were more conservative than banks. So our losses in
    the early years from loan defaults were zero, which is clearly too low. It meant
    that we were turning down a lot of business that we should have been writing.
    Since the crisis we’ve continued to outperform banks, but we have seen some credit
    loss, which is a good thing. It’s a good thing as long as we manage the risk effectively.
    During the first years, we were too stringent and we learned lessons from being
    very conservative. It’s always better to learn by starting from a conservative
    base. It’s easier to add more risk than to take it away. You learn a lot from
    conservative behaviour, because you can do retrospective analysis of the customers
    you declined. You can look at the past data and find cells of people who didn’t
    look great to you when you made your decision, but who actually turned out to
    be fine. By doing this, you can then improve your models and your algorithms to
    reflect that. In other words, we were building a credit model in exactly the opposite
    way to a payday lender strategy, which is to learn from the people they shouldn’t
    have lent to.

  zh: 我认为现在这归功于卓越的分析和风险管理，但最初我认为是因为我们比银行更加保守。因此，我们在早期由于贷款违约而造成的损失为零，这显然太低了。这意味着我们拒绝了很多本该接受的业务。自危机以来，我们一直在表现优于银行，但我们确实看到了一些信贷损失，这是件好事。只要我们有效地管理风险，这就是件好事。在最初的几年里，我们过于严格，我们从非常保守的做法中吸取了教训。从保守的基础开始学习总是更好的。增加风险比减少风险更容易。从保守的行为中你会学到很多，因为你可以对你拒绝的客户进行事后分析。你可以查看过去的数据，并找到那些在你做出决定时看起来不太好的人群。然而，他们实际上表现得很好。通过这样做，你可以改进你的模型和算法以反映这一点。换句话说，我们正是在以完全相反的方式构建信贷模型，与放贷人的策略完全相反，他们是从他们本不应该放贷给的人中学习的。
- en: 'We learned from this that we had been lending incredibly conservatively. We
    didn’t lend to people who subsequently went on to get a loan and pay it back.
    We then asked: “How can we try to lend to those people, as well as the people
    we lent to before?” It’s just a slow process. You have to wait a couple of years
    to find out who the people you declined were, who then went on to pay back and
    behave well, because you can’t judge them quickly. You can’t judge them on their
    first six or twelve months behaviour, for example. You have to wait a couple of
    years. Contrast this with the payday lending credit model. Payday lenders can
    lend indiscriminately at first. They are lending small amounts of their own money,
    and learn more rapidly based on very quick repayment cycles, but we couldn’t do
    that because it isn’t our money and the repayment cycles are much slower. We lend
    somebody else’s money. But, if you take longer, you can work intelligently to
    build better credit models.'

    the Prosper platform, and we’re looking for new ways to expand access and distribution.
    The UK has been a leader in this area, and we’ve learned from what has happened
    in that market. Many institutions buy loans from Prosper and then make them available
    to retail people in exchange traded, closed-end funds and in pool vehicles and
    in securitizations. We’re very focused on expanding access to retail investors
    in the US with similar types of opportunities.

    market—it is much bigger than anyone believed. That’s really evident in the numbers.
    Just take a look at Prosper for a moment. In the first quarter of 2015, Prosper
    facilitated $595 million dollars in loans through its platform, and in the second
    quarter we did $912 million.

    hours a day and have a great experience. They don’t have to put on a suit and

    build something from scratch. Then, every decision you make can be aligned to
    your vision, and can be aligned to the competitive advantages that you’re trying
    to create. Whereas if you are in a big, established bank, every decision you make

    way of legacy, existing customers, or existing products and services.

    We don’t intend to open with all products and services from day one, and are more
    conscious about the need to get it right than the need to do it all. Our aim is
    to build our reputation on high quality, and we can be small and grow well through
    that approach. The alternative is to try to be big early and encounter problems,
    and so we know which way we would rather go. Overall, the implementation will
    take about a year, but we certainly want to start that journey in the second half
    of 2015\. Those are the plans.

    our own work. We haven’t outsourced or contracted work to any consultancy. Our
    bank is designed by our team. We have written our own documents and applications
    to the regulators. We have taken in subject matter experts to help out in specific
    parts of it but, ultimately, it has been blueprinted and designed from the ground-up
    by us. A lot of this comes down to with whom you surround yourself with, and we’ve
    got some hugely talented people. It’s funny, as I was talking to the team during
    the briefing this morning and I kind of said, “You’re not looking over your shoulders
    saying someone else did it”. Whatever happens at Atom will happen because we did
    it. Consequently if it’s good, we get to pat ourselves on the back. If it’s bad,
    there’s no one else to blame. I am confident we have got the right talent and
    I am sure I speak for everyone that works there when I say: how many opportunities
    will you get to build a bank from the blueprint plans on a clean sheet of paper
    through to the reality?'

    investors, so it is an interesting mix of City institutions, fairly big names
    and influential backers from the North East. It creates a clear link to the City
    and to where we are based. That has been very helpful in building the bank locally,
    as well as building the broader story of the bank in the City. It is also reassuring
    when people choose to back you. It is a vote of confidence. That adds momentum
    to a team, especially when these investors are pretty shrewd, renowned and respected
    investors.

    at any innovation adoption curve. You could pretty much say, if you were going
    to invest in new technology, you could go to the professional services sector
    such as teachers, accountants and so on. Or go to new students and graduates.
    If you look at the adoption across the age spectrum, you see that there are massive
    differences in every age demographic. What we have concluded, therefore, is that
    there is a mindset about digital adoption, and certainly a relationship between
    financial literacy and digital literacy. So, if you follow the orthodox thinking
    within the industry, you are probably looking at people who switch banks in their
    late 20s or early 30s, but we want to appeal to a broad generation. So, I may
    be wrong on this, but I think our primary appeal will be to a median age around
    25 or 26\. These people are not bound to the industry that I grew up in, and they
    are absolutely using technology on an increasing basis to manage their life and
    money.

    So our founders, Vernon Hill and Anthony Thompson, discussed the situation of
    banking in Britain and Anthony convinced Vernon to come to the UK. Vernon’s model
    is all about building for convenience and providing superior service across every
    channel. Our customers are empowered to bank with us, however, wherever and whenever
    they want to. Yes, we have The Bank Start-ups stores, and we are rapidly growing

    bring your dog into the store, and make it easy for you to do so. It is why, for
    the last three years, we are the only bank to have won a gold award from Mumsnet
    for being family friendly, and that is for both our customers and our colleagues.
    So is it a gimmick to have lollipops and toilets in all of our stores? Is it a
    gimmick to have baby changing facilities? Well again, Mumsnet have given us their
    award for innovation for those things. So to me, that’s not a gimmick. We’ve also
    won the Kennel Club, Open For Business With Dogs Award for the last three years
    in a row, as they recognise who we are and what we do for all of our customers.
    We keep winning these well-publicised awards and, as a result, we win a lot of

- en: The one that most impressed me is IMPS, a real-time mobile payments project
    in India. Just during the month of December in 2014, it registered over 9.5 million
    real-time transactions, mainly via mobile—not necessarily smartphones—surpassing
    by a good five times its results from the preceding year. It has a user park of
    over 70 million digital account holders. A boom, and it is just the beginning.
    To sum it up, it managed to apply the success of a scheme like that of M-PESA
    to a population of over 1.2 billion individuals. This is something that is truly
    breaking the mould and changing the game. True innovation is measured by the number
    of people whose lives it can truly improve. We tend to look towards the West,
    primarily the US, but I have the impression that innovation in the world of banking
    and finance will increasingly come from the south and east. There are many other
    examples in Africa, China, Australia, Korea…

    But I don’t think they will become banks in the true sense of the word. It is
    much more probable that they will concentrate on the most mass market and easiest
    to manage parts internationally, like with payments. It will not be easy to get
    out of the US. It will be a long path, just like it was for PayPal. I wouldn’t
    underestimate Amazon and Google. The first one already manages payments globally,
    the second has such a mass that it can do what it wants. There will surely be
    great disruptions from them as well. The wave is long, it started with PayPal,
    which was born in 1998.

    outside of the control schemes of the central banks. With this, other virtual
    currencies were created just about everywhere. In my opinion, though, bitcoin
    is still not a true currency and suffers from the same mechanisms that brought
    about its success one year ago: too much volatility and zero regulations. A year
    ago, it registered a positive value and, so, everyone was enthusiastic. Now, it
    seems like a failure—because bitcoin is perceived speculatively, as an investment,
    and not as an exchange value. The history of money teaches that exchange rates
    and values cannot be too volatile. This is the limitation of bitcoin, though I
    don’t think it’s impossible to resolve. But, above and beyond its future, whether
    it will be successful or not—and this will definitely take years and years—bitcoin
    is a sign that the current banking and transaction system on a global scale must
    confront digitalisation. Currently, it is too old, too obsolete. A different transnational
    system is necessary, that functions like the digital economy: real-time on a global
    level, and, inevitably, with some form of transparent governance. Because, without
    trust, a currency does not exist. This is its true message.'

    people need and want. In comparison to “normal digital concepts” we may have grown
    faster, but we did not and could not, as we are a bank that is restricted to the
    [MK1] regulatory capital requirements that are needed to support such growth.
    In a nutshell, one can say that we are forced to grow profitably and you can only
    do that as long as you have the capital. That, of course, is not always easy,

    you can feed with two pizzas. If you need more than two pizzas, it means that

    and what aspects of the bank we didn’t have. When you launch a bank, you need
    to know how it’s going to be competitive. This is a key question, because when
    you launch a big innovation, a new digital bank, you need to know how the competitors
    will respond. They’re firstly going to try to copy us. This means that the only
    way for us to compete was with innovation. We could not create one innovation,
    but we had to be innovating every month. If they started copying, no problem.
    They could copy a few times, but if they keep copying, they would become a follower,
    not a leader. That was our objective: to make all the banks followers, and for
    us to gain this competitive advantage.'

    of a mobile network operator who basically provided a way for people to associate
    electronic wallets to their mobile phone number. It’s an evolution of the airtime
    concept, because airtime represents value. When you have airtime, you can call
    on the mobile wallet from the mobile phone. So the mobile wallet is actually an
    evolution of that concept, where you can offer stored value associated with the
    SIM card on the phone or, most often, by the provider as value.

    affordable for the users, because the technology involved is very streamlined
    and efficient.
  id: totrans-789

    you need to subscribe people to mobile wallets and then enable them to digitize
    cash. In other words, to put cash on their account wallet and to take money out
    of the system as well, which is a natural evolution of the agents that the mobile
    network operators (MNOs) have to sell airtime. So the agent concept evolves, and
    they become not only resellers of airtime but also handlers who can bring people
    on board so that they can cash in and cash out. They add a fee, of course, but
    now the money is onboarded to a digitized network.

    you can send and receive money. So that’s good progress, but we don’t see that
    as the ultimate success. For example, exactly as it was with mobile phones at

    characteristics and comply to regulations, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism,
    Know Your Client (KYC) and more.

    remains very streamlined so that it can be super-scalable and also very cost effective.
    When you look at existing traditional financial systems, none of that is actually
    the case. So this digital financial system needs to have some of the same characteristics,
    but with a much faster, cheaper technological base.

    shape or form for M-PESA. If we look at a country like Nigeria, for example, none
    of these things actually exist. There is no specific regulation allowing mobile
    money and there is a multitude of small players with very little reach individually.
    This is where, again, if you look at this as a national infrastructure for payments,
    then this argument of essentially a shared utility or a shared infrastructure
    makes a lot of sense.

    to have things such as a strong, anti money-laundering structure embedded, but
    if you start asking each and every provider of mobile money services to implement
    that themselves, then two things will immediately happen. First, the overall cost
    of the system will dramatically increase; and second, the system will be only
    as reliable as the weakest of the components or the providers.

    such as Nigeria, there is a very strong argument to provide a shared infrastructure
    that does certain things all at once from the beginning, on behalf of the community
    of providers. These things would include fraud management and KYC, as typical
    examples of such things. These things can be quite tricky to implement and manage.
    This means that doing it once on behalf of the whole community, and having the
    regulator look at only one system, makes it a lot easier.

    small providers and they each try to cultivate their own agency networks; but,
    in fact, what’s happening underground is they are poaching agents from each other,
    and as a result the agent network as a whole is not increasing. So in Nigeria,
    if you put all of these agent networks together, there’s about 15,000 of them.
    Most are located in the big cities while, in fact, Nigeria needs around 100,000
    agents, mostly located outside of the big cities. That’s where this notion of
    seeing the agent network as a shared good, or shared utility among providers,
    starts making a lot of sense.

    it’s very rare that they would have all the requirements of the identity schemes

    rich domain of innovation.

    into key partnerships with the central banks in the countries where we work because
    mobile money is money, and therefore has to be regulated. If the central bank
    doesn’t allow for it, then it does not work. This was the case in India, where
    mobile money circumvented the central bank and was restricted to very specific
    use cases in very specific domains. We have established a very strong partnership
    with the central banks in the eight countries we work in (India, Indonesia, Pakistan,
    Bangladesh, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania).

    such as banks, mobile network operators and FinTech infrastructure or service
    providers. The Foundation does not implement the digital platforms for mobile
    money systems. That’s not our job. Our job is to foster the creation of this system
    by the private sector players on the ground, either local or regional or global.
    What we do then is we de-risk the beginning of this implementation with philanthropy
    capital.

    in order to make a profit, you need to have a huge scale from the system. You
    need a huge number of payments to be digital, so that profits can be made through
    this huge scale. To get to that scale is difficult, because the business might
    not be material for the providers. They may say: “This is great, but if I need
    to invest for three years to break even, I just won’t do it. I don’t have a case
    for that.” This is where we can play a role by providing philanthropy capital.'

    It’s that user-to-user payment transactions are instantaneous and settled immediately,
    even if they are on different providers. That’s objective number one. The consequence
    of this is that if these users are served by different providers then, of course,
    the providers have to settle between themselves. That settlement currently takes
    place once a day in The Philanthropist the traditional banking system. This is
    where the blockchain concept of a distributed ledger can make inter-provider settlements
    happen much faster than intraday, simply because the way the technology works
    makes that possible. In this process, there is a reduction of intermediaries and
    reduction of time, and this will also have very positive consequences by settling
    several times a day. The outcome is that you actually drastically reduce the risk
    of one of the providers being unable to settle and reduce the capital requirements
    needed from them.
