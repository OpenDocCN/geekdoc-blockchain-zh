    advocacy and education; communicating what is bitcoin; why it is important; what

    making them aware of what bitcoin is able to do for them. Then there’s also Bitcoin
    Core for the Open Source Software Project and Gavin Andersen was the lead developer
    for a long time. He’s now stepped out of the role of lead developer, but the Foundation
    was financing the salaries of a few key people to support the development of the

    regulations in a way that will proceed positively.

    Core）这个开源软件项目，加文·安德森（Gavin Andersen）长时间担任首席开发者。他现在退出了首席开发者的角色，但基金会一直在资助一些关键人员的薪水，以支持开源协议的发展。然后最后一个部分是政策，这是关注政府如何寻求对此进行监管，并试图以积极的方式影响这些法规的部分。

    possible way to make everyone happy, and so you’ve got some very different organisations.

    familiar with ChangeTip, but they’re focused on micro transactions, which, because
    most of the developing world cannot use the current payment systems, is going
    to be a key. Most of the developing world cannot use credit cards. If you have
    a credit card in Africa and you go online to purchase something, the merchant
    and the payment infrastructure and fraud detecting services have to trust you.
    The problem is that they more or less systematically deny anyone from Africa from
    being able to buy anything with a credit card. It’s a trustless payment system.
    In this context, I think it is very compelling for allowing those excluded to
    be included. Bitcoin, or something like it, will allow the other 70 percent of
    the planet to participate in the internet economy, which is a great thing for
    anyone doing business online.

    it is the Internet of Information. It’s made possible because of the communications’
    protocol TCP/IP. The problem is that you cannot transact value over TCP/IP without
    a trusted counterparty or intermediary. What Satoshi solved was the issue of a
    double-spend. If I sent you an email with a picture attached to it, how do you
    know when you receive it that I didn’t keep a copy for myself or sent it to four
    other people at the same time? TCP/IP is a protocol designed for that. What Satoshi
    Nakamoto has achieved is that he’s created a protocol that permits the transmission
    of value, in any form. That is a revolutionary event. Now, does bitcoin’s blockchain
    end up being the successful platform for all of that activity? I don’t know, but
    do I think that it’s interesting and dependable? I think bitcoin, as a non-sovereign,
    math-based currency, is very interesting. It’s interesting from so many views.
    For example, from the developing world, in places like Russia and Ukraine today,

- en: They’re categorically untrue. I’ll give you a really good example. Take my pal
    Patrick Byrne, the CEO and chairman of Overstock. About a year ago, he was saying
    he had no interest in cryptocurrencies or in bitcoin. Well, somebody convinced
    him that there were pockets of bitcoin all over the place that couldn’t be spent
    anywhere. So he said, let’s go after those pockets of bitcoin and sell them garden
    furniture. This was a marketing ploy. He announced, “Overstock will accept bitcoins.”
    The press loved it. But Overstock wasn’t “accepting” bitcoins, because every sale
    had to go through Coinbase. What’s more, Patrick was smart enough to have negotiated
    with Coinbase that he wouldn’t have to pay a commission on the currency conversion.
    So “accepting” bitcoin didn’t cost him anything. The very first day he racked
    up $133,000 worth of bitcoin-driven sales. It looked like he was supporting the
    bitcoin community, so the bitcoin community supported him. Within three months,
    however, his bitcoin-driven sales were down to $7,000 a day. Why? Because the
    people who had pockets of bitcoin and no place to spend them, had spent them.
    And they didn’t buy back in. They saw no reason to buy any more bitcoins simply
    to use them to purchase pillowcases and garden furniture priced in dollars at
    Overstock. That’s significant. Think about it. How is there any logical reason
    for anybody to take dollars to buy bitcoins to pay for things priced in dollars?
    It adds no value and, in fact, creates extra expense. So, his sales dropped down
    to $7,000 a day. He then announced that he would accept bitcoin worldwide and
    his sales went up to $8,000 a day. But they have since fallen again. He has even
    said publicly, there is no international interest in bitcoin. None.

  zh: 这些说法绝对不属实。我给你举个很好的例子。拿我朋友帕特里克·伯恩来说，他是Overstock的CEO兼董事长。大约一年前，他说他对加密货币或比特币不感兴趣。然后，有人说服他，说比特币遍布各地，但无法在任何地方使用。于是他说，让我们去找到这些比特币并将它们兑换成花园家具出售。这是一个营销策略。他宣布：“Overstock将接受比特币。”媒体很喜欢。但实际上Overstock并没有“接受”比特币，因为每笔销售都必须通过Coinbase进行。更重要的是，帕特里克足够聪明，与Coinbase协商过，他不必支付货币转换的佣金。因此，“接受”比特币对他来说没有成本。第一天他就实现了价值$133,000的比特币驱动销售额。看起来他在支持比特币社区，所以比特币社区也支持他。然而，仅仅三个月后，他由比特币驱动的销售额下降到每天$7,000。为什么？因为那些拥有比特币但无处可花的人已经花掉了它们。他们没有再购买。他们认为没必要再购买比特币，只是为了用它们购买Overstock以美元计价的枕套和花园家具。这很重要。想想看。有什么逻辑理由让任何人拿美元购买比特币，然后用它们购买以美元计价的东西？这没有增加价值，事实上，只是增加了额外的费用。因此，他的销售额降至每天$7,000。然后他宣布将在全球范围内接受比特币，他的销售额上升到每天$8,000。但是后来销售额再次下降。他甚至公开表示，没有人对比特币感兴趣。一点儿都没有。
- en: Shortly after admitting worldwide disinterest, he filed a report with the SEC
    which received no media attention whatsoever. He’d decided to hold on to 10 percent
    of all his bitcoin sales. It means that Coinbase now converts 90 percent and sends
    him the remaining 10 percent. So he’s holding onto $700 a day worth of bitcoin
    business, which he says he is giving to his staff as bonuses. (By the way, the
    staff apparently insisted they put a bitcoin ATM in the lobby of the building
    in Utah so they could cash out right away.) Now, with $7,000 a day of bitcoin-driven
    sales, he’s saving his three percent Visa and Mastercard fees. That’s $210\. Okay,
    $210 a day times 365 adds up. Except, he told the SEC that, in order to integrate
    the 10 percent he holds, he must integrate $700 a day into his bookkeeping for
    tax purposes. That’s not so easy, because bitcoin is considered property by the
    tax people, which means there are both capital gains and capital loss calculations
    on each bitcoin. So far, he told the SEC, for the privilege of keeping a few bitcoins
    on his books, it has cost him $400,000\. Next, Patrick said in that SEC filing,
    he would probably have to spend another $400,000 to make his bookkeeping fully
    compatible. So, he’s spending $800,000 to save $210 a day. It will take him almost
    ten years to get his money back. Explain to me how this is a good idea, how this
    is sustainable, how this makes any sense at all.

    So, the idea is that instead of storing credit card numbers in your phone, you
    store an alias to the credit card number. You store a token. And if somebody steals
    that token, it’s of no use to them. They don’t know what card that token belongs
    to. There’s a few things going on there because the banks, and various other people
    of course, have to make quite big investments in this to make it work.

    them to be most cost-effective in the long term?” And that’s actually interesting

    just give you a token that says: “Here are things you need to know about me.”
    I don’t want to drop down too many levels of technical boring detail, but because
    there is a migration to APIs (Application Program Interfaces) underlying all of
    this, that’s an important area as there is pressure on the banks to get their
    API frameworks together. This pressure is because there are timescales around
    this. For example, in the UK, it’s the Treasury Framework. You’ve also got the
    European Framework. You’ve got the work that’s going on in the EPC (European Payments

    have to comply with KYC (Know Your Client), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), CTF (Counter-Terrorism
    Funding), they already know who you are. They’ve already checked your documents.
    I think, with a decent strategy and, just as importantly, decent APIs, banks can
    stand to play a pretty interesting part in that, and it’s certainly a way of keeping
    banks as part of the transactional infrastructure around that.

    offer a cheaper service. You can then imagine that there are structural reasons
    why banks would prefer to deal with SWIFT rather than Ripple. So, if SWIFT could
    use Ripple and cut costs, then everyone’s happy. VISA and MasterCard is a more

    I’ve been involved with cryptocurrencies since quite early on. I found the mathematics
    behind it fascinating and delved into the blockchain The Bitcoin Debate mechanics,
    which is a very intriguing idea. I’ve used bitcoin, and I have to say, as a user,
    it is a fantastic user experience. It really is nifty that with a push of a button
    you can send real value to somebody else. I urge everybody I speak about it to

    are not backed by governments. Money is very closely related to taxation and governments.
    I can see bitcoin as a phenomenon for low-end transactions, exchanging low values.
    But I have a hard time seeing something like bitcoin replacing large-value transactions,
    or being used as a store of value on a big scale. The whole outstanding value
    of bitcoin is just a couple of billion dollars and the daily volume, if I’m not
    mistaken, is in the order of $50–100 million.

    negligible. It may become less as the transaction volume grows, but it will never
    be zero. Therefore I have yet to be convinced that bitcoin is completely frictionless.

    the only real pure-play that I can think of that has made it is PayPal, which

    and that tends to be persistent and difficult to displace. It’s not that easy
    to build new infrastructures or replace existing ones, unless the existing infrastructures
    have failings. As such, it can be better to work with them, than to try and build
    your own. My favourite example is Apple Pay. Apple Pay did the smart thing and
    leveraged the credit card technology and networks that were out there. Yes, Apple
    will capture part of the value created, so there’s some transfer of value. But
    the banks and their infrastructures are still playing a large role in this new
    set-up. So infrastructures such as SWIFT have a few things in their favour.
  id: totrans-253

    high value exchange—with credit and market risk, capitalization, and the frameworks,
    as well as the regulation that goes around it. There is much discussion that blockchain/shared
    ledger, and in particular smart contracts, could offer real DVP (delivery versus
    payment) and thus take some of this risk out of the system—but that remains to
    be proven. Meanwhile, in high-value transaction systems, as in large securities
    transactions or large foreign exchange transactions, you do need to worry about
    default risk and about collateral and the capital against it. Regulators certainly
    do worry about it.

    peer-to-peer lending. Peer-to-peer lending is a very interesting phenomenon. The
    default risk sits squarely with the lenders, not with the intermediary. It’s different
    from a bank deposit, which the bank protects against defaults. The worry here
    is that defaults tend to go through cycles. For a while, it goes very well and
    you get high returns. We will have to see what happens in a downturn when defaults
    go up and lenders may panic.'

    things have the potential to fundamentally change how we do things with money

    as well. I think the right way to look at it is, again, how Apple Pay was conceived,
    which is a combination of the old and the new. I hope the same is true for SWIFT.
    What we do for our member banks is allow them to exchange value between themselves
    and, if there are newer technologies, there are two options: either we leverage
    that to provide even better value to our banks, or there’s no need for us anymore.
    And if there is no need for us anymore, then we should stop what we are doing
    and return the money to our owners. But I firmly believe we can leverage these
    new technologies to provide even better value. We’re looking at the blockchain
    technology, keeping a very close eye on it. If there is a way to improve the service
    we provide to the banks with that new technology, then we will use it. We are

    will play out. I think there’s also another interesting angle to this, as it’s
    not just the technology layer. What we do is message exchange between banks. If
    you look at the cost of a cross-border transaction for a consumer, a very small
    fraction of that is SWIFT. A SWIFT message costs about $0.04\. A cross-border
    transaction can cost anywhere in the order of $5 to $50, depending on which bank
    you use. So yes, we’re taking a look at these technologies—but I think there’s
    also room for the banks to look at the whole correspondent banking value chain,
    and see if there are ways to do that more efficiently. Is there a way to change
    the business layers of correspondent banking with this technology, and thereby
    reduce the cost and the friction to the consumer? That is something we are working
    with the banks to explore.

    could go to an e-commerce site as a consumer, select whatever you want, and then
    when you come to the checkout have the option to click on “Buy Now, Pay In Fourteen
    Days”. When you did select that payment method, instead of Visa or MasterCard,
    you just entered your name, address and date of birth. That was all the information
    we needed. Based on that limited information we were able to take that data, perform
    the risk assessment and give a “yes” or “no” answer within a second. If the answer
    was “yes”, then the merchant was paid there and then, no matter what happened.
    This meant they could be confident in shipping the goods right away to the customer,
    who would pay up to 14 days later.

    this data is made publicly available in Sweden, and hence this kind of risk assessment

    out my credit card and start filling out the details. It’s even easier, as I don’t
    have to enter all these numbers on this very small smartphone. I can just enter
    my zip code, and instantly you guys approve the transaction. Why don’t you guys
    do this for the entire checkout, to make the entire checkout easier?”'

    have launched in the UK and are about to launch in the US. It works well. For
    example, in Sweden, we’ve been able to convert more than 50 percent of all our
    transactions into this new payment solution. The way it works is that, when you
    come into the checkout, you only need to enter your email address and zip code,
    and that’s it. It’s the only thing you need to do before pressing the “Buy Now”
    button or “Place Order” button. You come to the confirmation page instantly, and
    the order is approved. You also have the option, on that confirmation page, to
    decide if you want to change the payment method but, if you don’t, you can just
    close down your smartphone and you will get your goods. You can then decide when
    you want to pay, up to 14 days later. That’s the essence of Klarna—what we’ve
    really done is separated the buying from the paying, where the paying is often
    the more complex part.

    In Germany for example, the consumer could actually settle in the end with the

    data means that we take in the data and analyse the risk from that data. If you
    shop at three o’clock in the morning, we see that as higher risk than if you shop

    for a first time user, where we may need slightly more data, especially if you’re

    all these cumbersome details because they distrust a 100 percent of buyers, rather
    than the one percent. We do the opposite. We give 85 percent of customers a very
    nice experience, because we think the risk is actually quite low. As long as the
    transaction makes sense; the IP address makes sense; you write with normal letters
    in lower case; it’s a daytime purchase; it’s a low cost item; and so on. As long

    They are the ones that have the consumer risk. Then you have the acquirers, who
    take the merchant risk and approve the merchant—the online shop, in this case.
    The issuers and acquirers are usually very traditional and, most of the time,

    one company, one innovation and one technical platform, then you can innovate

    One of my clients was a family-owned business in Europe. For me, it was one of
    the first times I was actually facing real entrepreneurs and I realised that they
    struggled to set up and maintain multiple banking relations in Europe for their
    international trading activity. Whilst we were having these meetings with them
    to talk about investment management, succession planning, corporate finance and
    many other things, they spent a lot of the time complaining about the relationships
    they had with banks. So we identified that banking fragmentation in Europe in
    itself was one of the trading barriers for the European Union. The frustration
    was enormous. I could relate to my own experience, I have had to open bank accounts
    with different banks in each one of the six European countries where I have lived.
    Why do we have to do that, and why do we have to maintain so many banking relations?
    We have to become treasurers in our own right, and that’s not to mention the inconvenience.
    So we started to find out why we had to do this, and why there is this problem.

    our deposits to feed their balance sheet—they want that to be stable. Banks look
    at cash management, which includes payments, current accounts and so on—as an
    appeal product; for them, it is a necessary evil to attract money to the balance
    sheet, so that they can carry on creditor activities. These two functions of the
    bank, cash and credit, are together as a legal entity in every bank, the restrictions
    applied to the credit function are also applied to the cash management function—as
    such, we have a fragmented banking industry in Europe. If we break the bank in
    two—which is actually what regulation is intending to do—we create a new generation
    of banking, thanks to the appearance of a new banking entity, exclusive to cash
    management. Not bound to a single country, this entity can now spread geographically
    over a number of countries. We created ipagoo to prove that this was possible.
    A new kind of bank that covers the whole of Europe, so our clients can hold a
    single relationship with as many bank accounts as they want.

    not defined anywhere. Previously, the origin of the credit institution, savings
    and credit, was everything those entities were doing, but they have now evolved
    into payment providers, too. That we do not give credit or make investments places
    us in the category of a new kind of bank, a new generation of bank devoted to
    cash management.

    two years—we are connecting four countries at the same time. It’s a huge achievement,
    and we are almost there. The payment system works, but we are still finishing
    services and having problems with delays with some of the banks in Europe, who
    are taking their time to update the payments routing tables. This makes the activation
    of new entities slow. Some haven’t updated tables in the last six months and this

    Currently the retail banking or cash-banking world is completely commoditised,
    you wont find something that will fit your niche. A different logo but the same
    service. Incentive to change doesn’t really exist. With ipagoo, the advantage
    is so important that that barrier disappears, the breakthrough is in convenience
    and adaptability. Think of the first time the iPhone was presented by Steve Jobs—we
    all wondered whether we would use it? But now look at what we can do with it;
    however, we had to try it first, as we had no reference point to know what to
    expect. The same thing will happen with ipagoo—its services and capabilities need
    to be experienced to understand what it is now possible. Our initial target is
    to focus on businesses and individuals with an international outlook. There are
    between 25–30 million EU nationals living in a country other than their country
    of origin. There are also 2.5 million Europeans changing country each year. There
    are 2.4 million businesses that have a presence in more than one country. Banking
    fragmentation obliges all those individuals and businesses to open new accounts
    every year. It is not just about switching, it’s about starting a new relationship.
    We cover their needs regardless of the country they are in.

    represent the disintegration of banking services that you mention in your book.
    Traditional retail banks pretend to be big supermarkets of everything within a
    single brand. But they cannot be good at everything, its impossible. Banks still
    pretend to be good at everything. This model is dead and Funding Circle and other
    niche players are proof of that. However, the problem for the end customer is
    that now he is facing hundreds, if not thousands, of new providers, so consumers
    need an aggregator. The natural aggregation layer is cash management. Whether
    you are going to receive or invest money from Funding Circle, you need a current
    account. We are the cash management bank for Europe, underneath which anyone of
    those new, specialised providers can access clients to be funded or offered credit
    to. We will work in open architecture—ipagoo is going to start connecting with
    third-party providers or investment banks that offer AAA cash funds and others.
    Even if you live in the UK, you can actually do business with a German bank you
    have never heard of before. We become the distribution channel, in the same way
    that eBay have merchants that only exist in eBay. We think that in the future
    some banks will evolve to distribute exclusively through us, where they can reach
    500 million people in Europe rather than be constrained to the country where they

    banks, one in each country. So, what is the strategy for any bank in Europe in
    terms of growth? Some of them have no strategy, especially as they don’t have
    the deep pockets required to go out and buy other banks or organically opening
    new subsidiaries— but even these two models we know don’t work very well. So ipagoo
    is disruptive in the sense that it allows a traditional bank in Europe, with a
    single balance sheet in a single country, to become European and serve 500 million
    people. Within banking, ipagoo represents that innovation. Banks become efficient.
    You reduce your distribution costs much more. That is fundamentally different
    from today’s model of fragmented balance sheets and difficult to manage. What
    I am saying is that no bank will resist the need to do this. The digitilisation
    of the banking industry as it has been preached so far has nothing to do with
    being innovative—banks are simply trying to reduce the cost of distribution by
    reducing the cost and access to the client. Digitalisation is one thing—changing
    your model to achieve tremendous efficiency and flexibility that unleashes innovation
    in such an advanced way is another.

    by being a more efficient connection for people who have money to connect with
    people who wanted money, and to do it in a fairer manner that didn’t involve a
    bank. This meant not taking deposits, but connecting people’s money through a
    marketplace solution.
  id: totrans-395

    lenders. Now that idea has moved through a pretty subtle morph, as there are now
    some businesses supplying capital. Institutions supply capital and, more recently,
    banks and the UK government supplied capital. In our case, we only lend to consumers,
    but now there are also other lending models, too. For example, retail consumers
    funding businesses through Funding Circle. Even so, the basic idea of connecting
    people with money to people who want it hasn’t changed.
  id: totrans-396
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea of that happening in a marketplace, not involving a bank, or bank balance
    sheets, means not requiring the regulations and the associated regulatory capital
    requirements of deposit-taking and, crucially in my mind, without any maturity
    transformation taking place. Therefore, it is not only creating a more efficient
    system in the marketplace, but also a more stable one, where both sides understand
    and agree the duration of a loan contract. It avoids the situation where people
    are borrowing short and lending long, which brought down the financial world in
    2008 in the global financial crisis.

    in different markets all around the world require subtly different interpretations
    of the basic business model. In some cases they require different licenses and
    different permissions and, in some cases, banks have to be involved. For example,
    in the US, securities are created and sold for the loans, and that has to be done
    via banks. In Germany, a banking license is needed. Even so, by and large, around
    most of the world, the idea is pretty much as it was created by us.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think now it’s down to superior analytics and risk management, but initially
    I think it was because we were more conservative than banks. So our losses in
    the early years from loan defaults were zero, which is clearly too low. It meant
    that we were turning down a lot of business that we should have been writing.
    Since the crisis we’ve continued to outperform banks, but we have seen some credit
    loss, which is a good thing. It’s a good thing as long as we manage the risk effectively.
    During the first years, we were too stringent and we learned lessons from being
    very conservative. It’s always better to learn by starting from a conservative
    base. It’s easier to add more risk than to take it away. You learn a lot from
    conservative behaviour, because you can do retrospective analysis of the customers
    you declined. You can look at the past data and find cells of people who didn’t
    look great to you when you made your decision, but who actually turned out to
    be fine. By doing this, you can then improve your models and your algorithms to
    reflect that. In other words, we were building a credit model in exactly the opposite
    way to a payday lender strategy, which is to learn from the people they shouldn’t
    have lent to.

    We then asked: “How can we try to lend to those people, as well as the people
    we lent to before?” It’s just a slow process. You have to wait a couple of years
    to find out who the people you declined were, who then went on to pay back and
    behave well, because you can’t judge them quickly. You can’t judge them on their
    first six or twelve months behaviour, for example. You have to wait a couple of
    years. Contrast this with the payday lending credit model. Payday lenders can
    lend indiscriminately at first. They are lending small amounts of their own money,
    and learn more rapidly based on very quick repayment cycles, but we couldn’t do
    that because it isn’t our money and the repayment cycles are much slower. We lend
    somebody else’s money. But, if you take longer, you can work intelligently to
    build better credit models.'

    A mortgage is a harder match because of the extra duration involved, and what
    could happen to interest rates and so on. In this country at least, consumers
    are signed up for their mortgages for 25 years. Lenders might sign up for that
    in the States but that’s not the nature of the market here yet, as it requires
    a different level of sophistication from the providers of the capital. But it

    to imagine them going straight to the originators and cutting out a lot of middlemen.
    I think that will happen, and we might have played a part in making it happen,
    but it’s a more complicated business. Also, unsecured lending is all done on a
    loan contract. Our contract doesn’t involve taking security and conveyancing,
    and having to perform legal searches and due diligence. None of that is unsolvable,

    euros is not so easy, I need to send out euros for them. My dollars are not the
    same as someone else’s in that sense, because some other person with dollars might
    want pounds for them. It’s just not a fungible item in the same way. A currency
    transaction has to be matched like an immaculate conception that occurs exactly
    at the same time, whereas our matching of lenders doesn’t have to be an immaculate
    conception because the transactions can be separated.

    want to borrow money with people who want to invest money. Between 2009 and 2015,
    more than $2.5 billion in personal loans originated through the Prosper platform.

- en: Prosper is an online marketplace for credit that offers access to consumer loans.
    We focus on three types of borrowers. The first is the person who wants to consolidate
    high-interest debt with a loan that offers a competitively priced fixed-rate and
    a fixed-term. The second type of borrower is someone who needs money for a large
    purchase. This could include things like a medical procedure, a home improvement
    project, purchasing a car, or funding a special occasion or travel. We also have
    people who are entrepreneurs who want to borrow on their personal credit for the
    purpose of their business. For all of these borrowers, Prosper offers access to
    fixed-rate, fixed-term loans that have no pre-payment penalty. On the other side,
    there are the investors—both individual and institutional—who want to help fund
    loan requests. We connect these three types of borrowers with these two types
    of investors.

    the Prosper platform, and we’re looking for new ways to expand access and distribution.
    The UK has been a leader in this area, and we’ve learned from what has happened
    in that market. Many institutions buy loans from Prosper and then make them available
    to retail people in exchange traded, closed-end funds and in pool vehicles and
    in securitizations. We’re very focused on expanding access to retail investors
    in the US with similar types of opportunities.

    quarter we did $912 million.

    around the world are all looking for the same thing. For example, I just got back
    from travels around the world, including China and Italy, telling the Prosper
    story. There is no place in the world that investors aren’t looking for yields
    of short duration that reports interest daily and pays monthly, and that’s exactly
    what we’re doing here. There are also many benefits to the borrower around speed
    and convenience. People who apply for a loan through Prosper can be at home 24
    hours a day and have a great experience. They don’t have to put on a suit and
    visit the bank and hope that a loan officer would give them a loan, like my father
    did. Online marketplaces for credit are far more efficient for investors and borrowers,
    to meet and do business together.

    all this traditional and alternative data, but what we can do with machine learning

    they simply cannot. To be radical you need to have a blank sheet of paper and
    build something from scratch. Then, every decision you make can be aligned to
    your vision, and can be aligned to the competitive advantages that you’re trying
    to create. Whereas if you are in a big, established bank, every decision you make
    is compromised by the need for it to connect to whatever is already on the table—by
    way of legacy, existing customers, or existing products and services.
  id: totrans-496

    Chris, as I don’t want to commit to them. We want to have completed the launch
    end-to-end within one year of opening our doors, so there is an awful lot to do.
    We don’t intend to open with all products and services from day one, and are more
    conscious about the need to get it right than the need to do it all. Our aim is
    to build our reputation on high quality, and we can be small and grow well through
    that approach. The alternative is to try to be big early and encounter problems,
    and so we know which way we would rather go. Overall, the implementation will
    take about a year, but we certainly want to start that journey in the second half
    of 2015\. Those are the plans.

    our own work. We haven’t outsourced or contracted work to any consultancy. Our
    bank is designed by our team. We have written our own documents and applications
    to the regulators. We have taken in subject matter experts to help out in specific
    parts of it but, ultimately, it has been blueprinted and designed from the ground-up
    by us. A lot of this comes down to with whom you surround yourself with, and we’ve
    got some hugely talented people. It’s funny, as I was talking to the team during
    the briefing this morning and I kind of said, “You’re not looking over your shoulders
    saying someone else did it”. Whatever happens at Atom will happen because we did
    it. Consequently if it’s good, we get to pat ourselves on the back. If it’s bad,
    there’s no one else to blame. I am confident we have got the right talent and
    I am sure I speak for everyone that works there when I say: how many opportunities
    will you get to build a bank from the blueprint plans on a clean sheet of paper
    through to the reality?'

    as well as building the broader story of the bank in the City. It is also reassuring
    when people choose to back you. It is a vote of confidence. That adds momentum
    to a team, especially when these investors are pretty shrewd, renowned and respected

    at any innovation adoption curve. You could pretty much say, if you were going
    to invest in new technology, you could go to the professional services sector
    such as teachers, accountants and so on. Or go to new students and graduates.
    If you look at the adoption across the age spectrum, you see that there are massive
    differences in every age demographic. What we have concluded, therefore, is that
    there is a mindset about digital adoption, and certainly a relationship between
    financial literacy and digital literacy. So, if you follow the orthodox thinking
    within the industry, you are probably looking at people who switch banks in their
    late 20s or early 30s, but we want to appeal to a broad generation. So, I may
    be wrong on this, but I think our primary appeal will be to a median age around
    25 or 26\. These people are not bound to the industry that I grew up in, and they
    are absolutely using technology on an increasing basis to manage their life and
    money.

    So our founders, Vernon Hill and Anthony Thompson, discussed the situation of
    banking in Britain and Anthony convinced Vernon to come to the UK. Vernon’s model
    is all about building for convenience and providing superior service across every
    channel. Our customers are empowered to bank with us, however, wherever and whenever
    they want to. Yes, we have The Bank Start-ups stores, and we are rapidly growing

    bring your dog into the store, and make it easy for you to do so. It is why, for
    the last three years, we are the only bank to have won a gold award from Mumsnet
    for being family friendly, and that is for both our customers and our colleagues.
    So is it a gimmick to have lollipops and toilets in all of our stores? Is it a
    gimmick to have baby changing facilities? Well again, Mumsnet have given us their
    award for innovation for those things. So to me, that’s not a gimmick. We’ve also
    won the Kennel Club, Open For Business With Dogs Award for the last three years
    in a row, as they recognise who we are and what we do for all of our customers.
    We keep winning these well-publicised awards and, as a result, we win a lot of
    business and customers through those little things that matter. So no, we don’t

    it is choice so that, if they want to be able to get a new card instantly, they

- en: The one that most impressed me is IMPS, a real-time mobile payments project
    in India. Just during the month of December in 2014, it registered over 9.5 million
    real-time transactions, mainly via mobile—not necessarily smartphones—surpassing
    by a good five times its results from the preceding year. It has a user park of
    over 70 million digital account holders. A boom, and it is just the beginning.
    To sum it up, it managed to apply the success of a scheme like that of M-PESA
    to a population of over 1.2 billion individuals. This is something that is truly
    breaking the mould and changing the game. True innovation is measured by the number
    of people whose lives it can truly improve. We tend to look towards the West,
    primarily the US, but I have the impression that innovation in the world of banking
    and finance will increasingly come from the south and east. There are many other
    examples in Africa, China, Australia, Korea…

    But I don’t think they will become banks in the true sense of the word. It is
    much more probable that they will concentrate on the most mass market and easiest
    to manage parts internationally, like with payments. It will not be easy to get
    out of the US. It will be a long path, just like it was for PayPal. I wouldn’t
    underestimate Amazon and Google. The first one already manages payments globally,
    the second has such a mass that it can do what it wants. There will surely be
    great disruptions from them as well. The wave is long, it started with PayPal,
    which was born in 1998.

    outside of the control schemes of the central banks. With this, other virtual
    currencies were created just about everywhere. In my opinion, though, bitcoin
    is still not a true currency and suffers from the same mechanisms that brought
    about its success one year ago: too much volatility and zero regulations. A year
    ago, it registered a positive value and, so, everyone was enthusiastic. Now, it
    seems like a failure—because bitcoin is perceived speculatively, as an investment,
    and not as an exchange value. The history of money teaches that exchange rates
    and values cannot be too volatile. This is the limitation of bitcoin, though I
    don’t think it’s impossible to resolve. But, above and beyond its future, whether
    it will be successful or not—and this will definitely take years and years—bitcoin
    is a sign that the current banking and transaction system on a global scale must
    confront digitalisation. Currently, it is too old, too obsolete. A different transnational
    system is necessary, that functions like the digital economy: real-time on a global
    level, and, inevitably, with some form of transparent governance. Because, without
    trust, a currency does not exist. This is its true message.'

    people need and want. In comparison to “normal digital concepts” we may have grown
    faster, but we did not and could not, as we are a bank that is restricted to the
    [MK1] regulatory capital requirements that are needed to support such growth.
    In a nutshell, one can say that we are forced to grow profitably and you can only
    do that as long as you have the capital. That, of course, is not always easy,

    to build some products, their size should be no more than the number of people
    you can feed with two pizzas. If you need more than two pizzas, it means that
    the team is too big and you will lose the momentum.

    and what aspects of the bank we didn’t have. When you launch a bank, you need
    to know how it’s going to be competitive. This is a key question, because when
    you launch a big innovation, a new digital bank, you need to know how the competitors
    will respond. They’re firstly going to try to copy us. This means that the only
    way for us to compete was with innovation. We could not create one innovation,
    but we had to be innovating every month. If they started copying, no problem.
    They could copy a few times, but if they keep copying, they would become a follower,
    not a leader. That was our objective: to make all the banks followers, and for
    us to gain this competitive advantage.'

    of a mobile network operator who basically provided a way for people to associate
    electronic wallets to their mobile phone number. It’s an evolution of the airtime
    concept, because airtime represents value. When you have airtime, you can call
    on the mobile wallet from the mobile phone. So the mobile wallet is actually an
    evolution of that concept, where you can offer stored value associated with the
    SIM card on the phone or, most often, by the provider as value.

    affordable for the users, because the technology involved is very streamlined
    and efficient.
  id: totrans-789

    you need to subscribe people to mobile wallets and then enable them to digitize
    cash. In other words, to put cash on their account wallet and to take money out
    of the system as well, which is a natural evolution of the agents that the mobile
    network operators (MNOs) have to sell airtime. So the agent concept evolves, and
    they become not only resellers of airtime but also handlers who can bring people
    on board so that they can cash in and cash out. They add a fee, of course, but
    now the money is onboarded to a digitized network.

    as the ultimate success. For example, exactly as it was with mobile phones at

    of regulation because, as the system grows transactions, then it must obey certain
    characteristics and comply to regulations, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism,
    Know Your Client (KYC) and more.

    remains very streamlined so that it can be super-scalable and also very cost effective.
    When you look at existing traditional financial systems, none of that is actually
    the case. So this digital financial system needs to have some of the same characteristics,
    but with a much faster, cheaper technological base.

    shape or form for M-PESA. If we look at a country like Nigeria, for example, none
    of these things actually exist. There is no specific regulation allowing mobile
    money and there is a multitude of small players with very little reach individually.
    This is where, again, if you look at this as a national infrastructure for payments,
    then this argument of essentially a shared utility or a shared infrastructure
    makes a lot of sense.

    to have things such as a strong, anti money-laundering structure embedded, but
    if you start asking each and every provider of mobile money services to implement
    that themselves, then two things will immediately happen. First, the overall cost
    of the system will dramatically increase; and second, the system will be only
    as reliable as the weakest of the components or the providers.

    such as Nigeria, there is a very strong argument to provide a shared infrastructure
    that does certain things all at once from the beginning, on behalf of the community
    of providers. These things would include fraud management and KYC, as typical
    examples of such things. These things can be quite tricky to implement and manage.
    This means that doing it once on behalf of the whole community, and having the
    regulator look at only one system, makes it a lot easier.

    small providers and they each try to cultivate their own agency networks; but,
    in fact, what’s happening underground is they are poaching agents from each other,
    and as a result the agent network as a whole is not increasing. So in Nigeria,
    if you put all of these agent networks together, there’s about 15,000 of them.
    Most are located in the big cities while, in fact, Nigeria needs around 100,000
    agents, mostly located outside of the big cities. That’s where this notion of
    seeing the agent network as a shared good, or shared utility among providers,
    starts making a lot of sense.

    it’s very rare that they would have all the requirements of the identity schemes
    that would onboard them to a traditional system. So tiered KYC schemes and identity
    schemes that rely on digital, such as e-Aadhaar in India, is a whole new, very
    rich domain of innovation.

    the Aadhaar numbering schemes. It’s all hugely important as well, and it’s an
    integral part of what we do. It’s not at all related to payments, but it’s really
    the basic infrastructure to get people onboard.

    into key partnerships with the central banks in the countries where we work because
    mobile money is money, and therefore has to be regulated. If the central bank
    doesn’t allow for it, then it does not work. This was the case in India, where
    mobile money circumvented the central bank and was restricted to very specific
    use cases in very specific domains. We have established a very strong partnership
    with the central banks in the eight countries we work in (India, Indonesia, Pakistan,
    Bangladesh, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania).

    such as banks, mobile network operators and FinTech infrastructure or service
    providers. The Foundation does not implement the digital platforms for mobile
    money systems. That’s not our job. Our job is to foster the creation of this system
    by the private sector players on the ground, either local or regional or global.
    What we do then is we de-risk the beginning of this implementation with philanthropy
    capital.

    in order to make a profit, you need to have a huge scale from the system. You
    need a huge number of payments to be digital, so that profits can be made through
    this huge scale. To get to that scale is difficult, because the business might
    not be material for the providers. They may say: “This is great, but if I need
    to invest for three years to break even, I just won’t do it. I don’t have a case
    for that.” This is where we can play a role by providing philanthropy capital.'

    It’s that user-to-user payment transactions are instantaneous and settled immediately,
    even if they are on different providers. That’s objective number one. The consequence
    of this is that if these users are served by different providers then, of course,
    the providers have to settle between themselves. That settlement currently takes
    place once a day in The Philanthropist the traditional banking system. This is
    where the blockchain concept of a distributed ledger can make inter-provider settlements
    happen much faster than intraday, simply because the way the technology works
    makes that possible. In this process, there is a reduction of intermediaries and
    reduction of time, and this will also have very positive consequences by settling
    several times a day. The outcome is that you actually drastically reduce the risk
    of one of the providers being unable to settle and reduce the capital requirements
    needed from them.
