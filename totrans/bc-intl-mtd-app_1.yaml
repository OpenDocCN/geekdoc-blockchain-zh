- en: We have experienced the proliferation of diverse blockchain platforms, including
    cryptocurrencies as well as private blockchains. In this chapter, we present an
    overview of blockchain intelligence. We first briefly review blockchain and smart
    contract technologies. We then introduce blockchain intelligence, which is essentially
    an amalgamation of blockchain and artificial intelligence. In particular, we discuss
    the opportunities of blockchain intelligence to address the limitations of blockchain
    and smart contracts.

    some similar concepts were proposed in 1990s (Zheng et al. [2017](#CR26)). Due
    to the technical limitations, this concept has not received enough attention until
    the appearance of digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have
    greatly driven the development of blockchain technologies. The blockchain essentially
    consists of a number of blocks, which store the transaction records as well as
    other transaction-related data fields. In order to help nodes in the blockchain
    network reach consensus in a distributed and untrusted environment, we need consensus
    algorithms. Blockchain data is essentially immutable, auditable, and traceable.

    conceived and presented by N. Szabo in the 1990s (Szabo [1997](#CR23)). In particular,
    contract clauses or terms can be written in computer languages, such as Java,
    Solidity, and Python. Those program codes can be automatically executed when certain
    conditions reach. Consequently, the conventional business procedures can be automated
    and thereby the bureaucratic costs can be greatly saved. However, smart contracts
    require to be executed on virtual machines or docker containers atop blockchains.
    Therefore, smart contracts and blockchain are essentially indivisible (Zheng et
    al. [2020](#CR27)).

    smart contracts. The blockchain data contains valuable information, operational
    information of blockchain systems, abnormal behaviors occurred in blockchains,
    potential malicious attacks, scam analysis, and transaction tracking. The recent
    advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning and deep
    learning, bring opportunities to analyze and exact valuable information from blockchain
    data. Moreover, AI technologies can also foster the intelligent blockchain operation
    or maintenance. We call the intelligent functions that AI gives to the blockchain
    as *blockchain intelligence*.

    growing. When a new block is generated, there will be a verification process,
    which requires all nodes in the block network to participate. If the verification
    is successful, this new block will be added to the blockchain. In this manner,
    all the committed transactions cannot be falsified.![../images/506524_1_En_1_Chapter/506524_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/506524_1_En_1_Chapter/506524_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png)

    of the block. The most representative consensus algorithms include proof-of-work
    (PoW) (Nakamoto [2008](#CR19)), proof-of-stake (PoS), and practical byzantine-fault
    tolerance (PBFT) (Castro et al. [1999](#CR4)). In PoW and PoS, the consensus procedures
    are usually done by the users (a.k.a. miners) who first give a solution to a computationally
    complex problem, also called a puzzle. PBFT has a different consensus procedure
    in contrast to PoW and PoS. Particularly, PBFT lets blockchain nodes reach the
    consensus through voting in multiple rounds. In short, compared with traditional
    transaction systems such as banks and remittances, because the consensus algorithm
    can ensure that transactions can be conducted without the introduction of third
    parties (such as banks), blockchain can greatly save transaction costs. Moreover,
    blockchain can also guarantee pseudonymity of users since they can use virtual
    addresses to conduct transactions instead of their real identities.

    *Decentralization* of blockchain allows the transactions to be validated by the
    majority of peers distributed in the entire system without the central agency.
    In this way, the bureaucratic cost can be saved and the system reliability can
    be enhanced. *Immutability* means that falsifications on data stored in the blockchain
    are extremely difficult because any slight modifications can lead to invalid data
    (invalid hash values). *Non-repudiation* of transactions can be assured by digital
    signature, asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, and distributed consensus mechanisms.
    *Traceability* implies that the origins of data can be traced through analyzing
    the publicly available blockchain data with the associated time stamps.

    blockchains, and (3) consortium blockchains. Public blockchains including Bitcoin,
    Ethereum, and EOSIO can be publicly accessible by every user in the blockchain
    network, while private blockchains have strict access control to limit accessibility
    of users. Consortium blockchains lie between permissionless and permissioned blockchains.
    Typically, public blockchains have poorer scalability than private blockchains
    due to the lower throughput of consensus algorithms where the throughput denotes
    the number of transactions being confirmed every second. Consortium blockchains
    achieve the performance lower than private blockchains while higher than public
    blockchains.'

- en: The idea of smart contracts was essentially conceptualized by N. Szabo in the
    1990s (Szabo [1997](#CR23)). Particularly, smart contracts were devised as a transaction
    mechanism, which can execute contract clauses or terms written in computer languages.
    Although smart contracts are not new, smart contracts have not been fully realized
    until the advent and maturity of blockchain technologies. Smart contracts are
    essentially implemented atop blockchains. First, multiple parties can reach an
    agreement on the contract clauses, which have then been converted into computer
    programs written in computer languages, such as Java, Solidity, and Python (Zheng
    et al. [2020](#CR27)). Through the logic flow in the program, the logical connection
    between the contract clauses in the smart contract is well preserved, e.g., the
    if-else statement or the if-else-if statement. The machine codes (or bytecodes)
    of programs have also been stored persistently in blockchain; they can also be
    accessible by others.

    a condition specified in a smart contract is satisfied, the triggered statement
    will automatically execute the corresponding function in a predictable manner.
    Take Fig. [1.2](#Fig2) as an example. There are two smart contracts in this example:
    (1) Contract 1 between a buyer and a supplier and (2) Contract 2 between the buyer,
    the supplier, and a carrier. As shown in Contract 1, the supplier provides the
    buyer with the product catalog, which includes the detailed product descriptions,
    such as price, stocks, and the place of origin. The buyer can then place the order,
    which specifies the quantity, the payment date, and the expected delivery date.
    All the data records are essentially saved in the blockchain. This whole process
    constructs the purchase contract, i.e., Contract 1\. Besides the buyer and the
    supplier, Contract 2 is also involved with the carrier, which will ship products
    from the supplier to the buyer. Similarly, the shipping terms (or conditions)
    are also specified in the contract. Once the supplier accepts the contract terms
    given by the carrier, the products will be sent to the carrier. The carrier then
    delivers the product to the buyer. The program constructs contract 2\. Kindly
    note that the execution of Contract 1 and Contract 2 can be automatically completed
    without any third parties.![../images/506524_1_En_1_Chapter/506524_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/506524_1_En_1_Chapter/506524_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png)'

    completed. In particular, after Contract 2 is completed, the supplier will pay
    the carrier for the shipment (i.e., transferring digital currencies from the supplier’s
    payable account to the carrier’s receivable account). Similarly, after Contract
    1 is completed when the buyer will pay the supplier (i.e., transferring digital
    currencies from the buyer’s payable account to the supplier’s receivable account).
    Because there is no third party (such as a bank), the entire process is done in
    a peer-to-peer manner. As a result, turnaround time and transaction costs can
    be greatly saved.

    smart contracts may contain bugs or faulty programming codes, which are vulnerable
    to crashes and malicious attacks. It is crucial to detect and identify bugs in
    smart contracts so as to achieve the ultimate goal of intelligent quality assurance
    of smart contracts. The work of Luu et al. ([2016](#CR18)) presents a symbolic-execution
    platform namely Oyente to detect and recognize potential bugs. Meanwhile, smart
    contracts are essentially program codes that are sensitive to execution cost (e.g.,
    the execution of smart contracts is charged by gas in Ethereum). Thus, it is a
    necessity to identify the gas-costly patterns and correct these vulnerable smart
    contracts. In Chen et al. ([2017](#CR5)), Chen et al. developed a tool namely
    GASPER to identify and locate seven gas-costly patterns via analyzing bytecodes
    of Ethereum smart contracts. Machine learning methods can be used to detect and
    recognize vulnerable bugs in smart contracts automatically. Moreover, the growing
    number of smart contracts also brings the opportunities to automate the composition
    of multiple contracts. In particular, we can find and identify contracts that
    fulfill users’ requirements and composite them together to realize more comprehensive
    applications. Different from conventional distributed software systems such as
    web services (Rodriguez-Mier et al. [2015](#CR22)), smart contracts lack semantic
    description and Quality-of-Service (QoS) evaluation metrics. As a result, new
    AI-based approaches are expected to automate labeling semantics of smart contracts

    A directed transaction network with encrypted currency transaction records as
    nodes often needs to be modeled according to the concept of a complex network.
    The edges of this network are at least one transfer between accounts or addresses,
    and the point is the only account or address on the system. Transaction tracking
    on blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems consists of two parts, tracing and
    prediction. On the one hand, the problem of tracing pays attention to how the
    cryptocurrency accumulated and flowed in the past by studying the transaction
    records. In Lin et al. ([2020](#CR17)), Lin et al. proposed to model Ethereum
    transaction records as a temporal weighted *MultiDiGraph*, which can represent
    more comprehensive information about transaction details than a simple graph.
    Moreover, to extract the most related information of each Ethereum account from
    a huge transaction network, this work put forward the concept of *K*-order subgraph
    to construct a local graph and designed several flexible temporal walk strategies
    for random-walk-based graph representation. Time-weighted MultiDiGraph embedding

    intelligence. Characterized by decentralization, immutability, non-repudiation,
    and traceability, blockchain has the potential to reshape incumbent industrial
    and business systems. Meanwhile, blockchain-enabled smart contracts can automate
    business procedures without the third parties, thereby mitigating the administrative
    cost and reducing the turnaround time. Moreover, blockchain systems and smart
    contracts have generated massive volumes of blockchain data, which contains huge
    business values. The integration of AI, machine learning, deep learning, and big
    data technologies can process, explore, and extract valuable information from
    heterogeneous blockchain data. The intelligent capability brought to blockchain
    is named as blockchain intelligence, which can greatly drive the development of
    the blockchain ecosystem. The wide applications of blockchain intelligence will
    be further elaborated in the coming chapters.
