- en: While going through the different chapters of the book we realize that quantum
    computing and blockchain are not contenders of each other rather they complement
    and supplement each other. We believe that while blockchain technology will continue
    forming a strong backbone for transparent and responsible tech-driven societies
    and businesses the quantum computing will provide revolutionary computing solutions
    that would help solving both cryptographic and real-world problems for a safer
    and secure computing. At this juncture it is too early to predict the future of
    the blockchain and quantum computing; and the kind of effect that quantum computing
    will have on blockchain world. The integration of both the emerging technologies,
    quantum computing and blockchain technology, will help world to be more secure,
    transparent, and democratized. This book provides a systematic study of different
    industries, businesses and operations that are using blockchain technology and
    how they are evolving themselves for a quantum proof world.

    of the community and researchers is continuously increasing for the post quantum
    blockchain. It also very clearly states the differences between the classical
    blockchain and post quantum blockchain. It thoroughly discusses various concepts
    like quantum key distribution, Quantum Resistant Ledger, qubits and many more.
    It explains various mechanisms and algorithms for quantum proofing the blockchain
    systems. It suggests the future work, for a specific case of blockchain based
    land management, will be to develop and implement a low-level framework of the
    blockchain for land management and administration to make the whole process of
    land identification, verification, and acquisition transparent for the parties
    involved, in this case, the landowners and those purchasing the lands. This will
    resolve a major problem in Ghana and Africa. A quantum dimension of this blockchain
    for land management and administration is of great interest amongst researchers.'

- en: Chapter 2, “Introduction to Quantum-Resistant Blockchain,” indicates that the
    threat that quantum computers pose to blockchain networks is mostly related to
    the insecure digital signatures of blockchain activities and the poor key-exchange
    protocols used for peer-to-peer communication over the network. It advocates that
    future blockchain applications should be able to handle several cryptographic
    algorithms in the PQC era in order to process both quantum and classical ciphers.
    New apps should be able to defend themselves against quantum threats while upholding
    the conventional standards by using hybrid key methods. Organizations will eventually
    need to get ready for new encryption standards. It also suggests that the field
    of post-quantum cryptography is finally catching up, and four different types
    of cryptosystems - elliptic curves, lattices, isogenies, and hash-based signatures—are
    gaining popularity. The security of blockchain is facilitated by post-quantum
    cryptography and quantum key distribution. Blockchain communities that aggressively
    search for new and effective ways to construct a Quantum-Resistant Blockchain
    are always developing innovative techniques to combat quantum computing processing
    power.

    Emphasizing the Indian Context,” states that Blockchain technology has significant
    impact in financial segment and in this regard not only private organization but
    also Government bodies, establishments and ministries playing leading role for
    the improvement of the Blockchain technology infrastructure. It draws attention
    towards the fact that, Foreign Direct Investment in India has increased in the
    areas of Computing and IT industry to 26.14 billion USD in the year 2020-2021
    though in the year 2019-20 it was just 7.67 billion US Dollar.'

- en: Chapter 4, “Design of a Blockchain-Powered Biometric Template Security Framework
    Using Augmented Sharding,” explains how sharding is used in order to reduce overall
    delay and energy consumption of biometric storage system via effective blockchain
    splitting. This splitting allows the blockchain to reduce number of computations
    needed in order to add, update, search and access internal blocks. Shards when
    combined can further improve upon the overall system performance by reducing delay
    and number of computations needed for hashing. Due to this combination, the proposed
    model is able to obtain over 20% reduction in communication delay, over 25% reduction
    in energy consumption, and over 20% improvement in overall storage throughput.
    Due to faster storage performance across fewer number of blocks, the probability
    of packet dropping is also reduced, this results in increasing the packet delivery
    ratio by 10% and reducing overall delay jitter by over 15% when compared with
    other sidechaining algorithms. i.e., also suggest that in future, researchers
    can further extend the performance of this algorithm by using better block truncation
    algorithms, and by utilizing improved machine learning models for shard creation.
    Moreover, the truncated data parts can be given moderate level of security in
    order to reduce chances of modification due to external and internal attacks,
    which will further strengthen network security.

- en: Chapter 5, “Green Currency Based on Blockchain Technology for Sustainable Development,”
    stresses that there is a need to establish value in the environmental assets that
    are utterly overlooked by society owing to ignorance. It advocates that the new
    virtual green currency based on blockchain technology has the potential to play
    a key role in the development of a market for green currency based on environmental
    green assets. This paper suggests one technology-based method to evaluate green
    assets and establish a market for green currencies. There are various other technologies
    also available to verify data captured and asset valuation. i.e. GPS. If this
    happens, it will certainly have a long-term impact on individual and societal
    behaviour when it comes to the proper use of natural resources. It stresses that
    in fact by not assigning a monetary value to green assets, we are undervaluing
    the efforts of people who are devoted to preserving them for a long-ago, particularly
    the primitives.

- en: Chapter 6, “Blockchain in Gaming,” explains how blockchain is being used in
    the gaming industry. Blockchain (BC) technology has revolutionised numerous fields,
    including no-prerequisite trading. Bitcoin used BC developments in 2009, and BC
    development ambitions increased. Electronic currency systems with an all-trades
    database were important applications. These deals use cryptographic hashes and
    key matching. The trade history preserves a chain of events so that adjusting
    or changing a past trade requires recalculating all subsequent blocks of trades.
    BC technology is in its early phases but depends on cryptographic rules and data
    storage. Many proposed algorithms use the development as of now. The advancement
    will likely evaporate as BC development becomes another tool. Through dispersion,
    a BC uses already-built association, cryptographic, and recording innovations.
    Innovation that examines the benefits and risks of new technologies will be crucial.
    Once a BC is done and accepted, it may be hard to change. When data is stored
    in a BC, it's permanent whenever there's a raise. BC development is still fresh;
    thus we should use it only when necessary.

    described the blockchain strategies alongside the quantum strategies. In conclusion,
    the authors described blockchain strategies alongside quantum strategies. How
    Blockchain is being used in various industries as technology advances. A blockchain
    protocol with information-theoretically consistent authentication that is completely
    based on a community to which every pair of nodes is linked via a QKD link. Through
    a three-birthday birthday celebration city fibre community QKD, we tested our
    protocol experimentally. In addition to using QKD for authentication, it has significantly
    redefined the protocol of adding new blocks in a manner that is markedly different
    from current cryptocurrencies. Rather than concentrating the development of new
    blocks in the hands of individual miners, we use the information-theoretically
    consistent broadcast protocol, in which all nodes reach an agreement on a brand-new
    block on the same terms. One significant advantage of our blockchain protocol
    is its ability to maintain transaction transparency and integrity in the face
    of quantum algorithm attacks. As a result, our findings open up new avenues for
    understanding scalable quantum-secure blockchain structures. If realised, any
    such blockchain platform could limit the financial and social risks posed by upcoming
    breakthroughs in quantum computation technology. The typical key technology costs
    of currently available QKD technology are sufficient for running large-scale blockchain
    structures entirely based on our protocol. Furthermore, fantastic advancements
    in the theory and practise of quantum communications, such as current experiments
    on ground-to-satellite tv for pc QKD and quantum repeaters, may want to open the
    door to growing a public international QKD community (“the quantum Internet”)
    and expanding quantum-secure blockchain structures to a global scale. The advancement
    of the “quantum Internet” will allow our protocol to maintain the anonymity of
    all community members. A member may be able to connect to the global QKD community
    from any location, authenticate themselves to different parties utilising their
    personal seed keys, and carry out a desired transaction. The quantum and blockchain
    paradigms will lead to advancements in a wide range of fields.'
