- en: Blockchain technology is probably the most attractive innovation since the emergence
    of the internet. Blockchain refers to an open distributed ledger spread across
    multiple computers that hold digitally recorded transactions in a much more efficient,
    transparent, and secure manner. A blockchain consists of a number of blocks, each
    containing data relating to digital assets and a hash header that links it to
    the previous block in the chain. The blocks are linked together, and new blocks
    can be added and removed, following a process of consensus. Also, those involved
    in the transactions can share the distributed digital ledger without needing a
    centralized intermediary. This chapter aims to introduce blockchain technology
    and discuss the use cases and initiatives in various sectors of the society, in
    particular within the blockchain product vendors and service providers. Characteristics,
    benefits, types, underlying technologies, and platforms are also discussed for
    the sake of completeness.

- en: The Blockchain technology is probably the most important innovation since the
    emergence of the Internet. It holds the same promise as the printing press or
    the Internet, to allow new forms of secure and anonymous communication to take
    place in many diverse sectors of the society and a multitude of industries. Areas
    that Blockchain is set to disrupt, include healthcare, transportation, supply
    chain, risk management, manufacturing, tourism, banking, education, and government,
    to name but a few. The Blockchain technology is still developing and yet it is
    already driving the digital revolution with the digitization of processes, automation,
    tokenization of physical resources, and codification of intricate contracts between
    stakeholders. Countries which have openly embraced this technology include China,
    USA, UK, UAE, Japan, Singapore and Australia. According to Market Watch (2020),
    Blockchain market share is expected to exceed USD 25 billion by the year 2025\.

    announced in a Bitcoin white paper published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008\. The
    first implementation appeared in 2009 (Zaky, 2020). This was essentially the realisation
    that the technology that underlined the operation of ‘bitcoin’ (the cryptocurrency
    that can now be considered as the application of Blockchain) could be separated
    from the currency and used for all kinds of other inter-organisational cooperation.
    There was, then, further development over the period of about 10 years in terms
    of smart contracts, proofs of work, and Blockchain scaling. A brief timeline of
    the development of Blockchain technology is presented in Figure 1.

    transparency, security, consensus, and smart contracts (Rosic, 2016; Tasca and
    Tessone, 2019). Witscad (2020) divides the characteristics into functional characteristics
    and emergent characteristics, as shown in Figure 2\. These are explained in later
    sections of this chapter. Because of the attraction of these features, Blockchain
    has been gaining attention in areas beyond its cryptocurrency roots since about
    2014\. This technology has now gone beyond its initial application in cryptocurrencies
    (such as Bitcoin). It is now being applied to nearly every sector of the society
    including banking, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, logistics, supply
    chain management, and risk management, to name but a few, as already mentioned.

    with no central control or authority, in which digital assets (transactions representing
    values, identities, agreements, property rights, credentials, etc) are recorded
    and linked together so that they provide the entire history and the current state
    or the provenance of the assets. It promises a more efficient, secure and transparent
    way of handling transactions of digital assets, that can save a huge amount of
    administration, bureaucracy, effort and time. The Blockchain technology is based
    on a complex branch of mathematics called cryptography.

    and trusted distributed ledger (or database) that consists of encrypted ‘blocks’
    of information added to a chain of existing blocks of records. The ledger relies
    on the consensus of a global peer network to operate. Modifying the data in a
    block is impossible without modifying the entire chain and receiving consensus
    of the entire peer network – this refers to the Blockchain characteristic called
    immutability (Robinson, 2018). Before a new block is added, it must first be validated
    by other participants (i.e. blocks also called nodes) to prevent fraud and increase
    security. Blockchain allows information to be verified and exchanged without relying
    on a central authority or an intermediary. Blockchain applications include: Bitcoin
    (cryptocurrency), Sia (decentralised cloud storage), and Ethereum (virtual machine
    to run smart contracts), to name but a few.'

    have formed the reasons for its use in various applications are decentralisation,
    transparency, immutability and smart contracts (Rosic, 2016; Tasca, 2019). These
    are briefly discussed below. Refer also to Figure 2 for a more detailed set of

    (i.e. the distributed ledger) exists on multiple computing systems, referred to
    as nodes. This is stark opposite to the traditional client-server model that is
    a centralised approach that has served the industry well but it has weaknesses.
    In a decentralised system, data is owned by all participants in the network. Also,
    interaction between nodes in the network does not need to go through an intermediary.

    via cryptography so user’ real identity is secure; also, every action on the Blockchain
    is driven by a digital signature that adds to further security. However, transactions
    can be seen via their public addresses; and this is for the sake of accountability,

    transactions between clients.'

    This is achieved through using cryptographic hash functions. Since, a block comprises
    data and a hash (of data in previous block) pointer to the previous block, it
    makes the system most reliable.'

    the need for human intervention, verification or arbitration. These contracts
    are used to enforce some type of agreement. Also, conflicting or double transactions
    cannot be written in the Blockchain. Any conflict is automatically reconciled
    and each valid transaction is added only once (Tasca and Tessone, 2019).'

    Asymmetric cryptography provides a much stronger algorithm that consists of public
    key (which is visible to all), and a private key (that is only available to the
    owner of the data that the key applies to). One of the applications of asymmetric
    cryptography is the digital signatures. Such signatures provide authenticity and
    integrity mechanisms for the data and documents; and provide strong control of
    owner of an asset (e.g. data or a document). In the case of a Blockchain: 1) a
    users’ public key is their Blockchain wallet (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum address)
    that is visible to all participants with the chain; and 2) the private key is
    used to digitally sign a transaction for ensuring that particular transaction
    is indeed generated by the sender, is stored safely in a crypto wallet.'

    digital ledgers (instead of keeping data centralized as in a single traditional
    ledger). Blockchain is, in fact, a form of distributed ledger, which organizes
    digital assets and transactions into a database of blocks (residing of different
    nodes), which are chained together in an append only mode. The advantage of a
    distributed ledger is that, since it is decentralised and self-regulating, it
    eliminates the need for a central controlling authority or an intermediary to
    process, validate or authenticate transactions, or other forms of data exchange.'

    part of the consensus mechanism to agree between all parties (nodes) that the
    Blockchain state is one and the same. Hashing involves taking an arbitrarily amount
    of input data, and then applying an algorithm to convert it to a fixed length
    data called the hash (ISO, 2016). Hashing and digital signatures are the two concepts

    such as with cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology. It is useful for record-keeping
    and history of transaction events. Since, a Blockchain is dynamically changing,
    it is important that there is an efficient, fair, real-time, functional, reliable,
    and secure mechanism to ensure that all transactions occurring in the network
    are genuine. There is therefore a need for all participants to agree on a consensus
    on the status of the ledger. Two of the most commonly used consensus mechanisms

    in the industry go far beyond the financial transactions and transfer of cryptocurrencies.
    With its ability to create more transparency, openness and fairness and with its
    characteristics such as immutability, this technology is impacting a wide variety
    of industries including finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation,
    to name a few. Some of the Blockchain use cases and initiatives within the industry,
    in particular within the Blockchain product vendors and Blockchain service providers,
    are elaborated in the following sub-sections.

- en: Currently, the financial transactions between individuals, organizations, and
    companies are taking place with the help of third-party approval of intermediaries
    such as banks, financial institutions, standardizing bodies, or credit card providers.
    These transactions involve multilevel approvals, costs, and inefficient processes
    in some cases, which also lead to waste of time and resources. To resolve these
    issues, blockchain technology has appeared as a new financial digital innovative
    solution. Here, financial transactions are online, open, and transparent. In this
    chapter, the authors present systematic literature of relevant research on blockchain
    technology. The objective is to understand the historical evolutions, current
    ongoing research, base technologies, and applications. The authors have extracted
    research articles from scientific databases including EBSCO, Scopus, Web of Science,
    and Google Scholar. The online blogs, wikis, media articles, YouTube videos, and
    companies’ white papers on blockchain technology are also used for content analysis.

    but especially across India, are desperately looking to fill the following job
    positions in the blockchain technology domain: Blockchain Developer, Blockchain
    Lead Developer, Blockchain Architect, Application Architect, Blockchain Engineer,
    Blockchain Specialist, Blockchain Expert, Blockchain Consultant, etc. This shows
    that the Indian software hubs of Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, Kochi, NOIDA,
    Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and so on are in an urgent need of the development of Blockchain
    technologies and their allied applications in order to smoothen the financial
    services. This is the need of the hour, not only for the Indian based financial
    institutions, banks, and IT/ITes companies, but also for the other sectors located
    across the globe. Here are a few examples of the job calls, on LinkedIn on 07/05/2020,

    technologies along with Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep
    Learning, Data Analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud Computing. There
    is much in the literature on this emerging technology in the form of news scripts,
    journal articles, book chapters, analysis reports, and books. There are also vocal
    discussions on blockchain technologies in public speaking events, seminars, conferences,
    lectures, doctoral colloquium, webinars, and even special programs like conference-cum-exhibitions.
    This shows that there is a huge demand for this phenomenon. The past studies are
    giving evidence that there is increasing demand for this technology, as this is
    becoming highly attractive especially for financial transactions and banking services.

- en: Blockchain technology is data management technology that permits the financial
    online transactions to be gathered into blocks and finally recorded. It allows
    the resulting ledger to be accessed by different servers in a fully connected
    computer network. Individuals or entities with no basis to trust each other can
    also use it without a central controlling authority. According to Brito & Castillo
    (2013), originally, blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks that
    are linked using cryptography. Although Blockchain Technology is becoming the
    base for entire financial service business using cryptocurrency, at first people
    knew about Bitcoin and only later, it developed into a technology. This suggests
    that initially, blockchain technology was used to record historical transactions
    of encrypted digital money such as Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008). So, before the introduction
    of Bitcoin, we had the online-distributed ledgers transactions, and there were
    distributed system records, which stored official information transactions at
    different nodes across the computer networks. Some background literature gives
    testimony that Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta described the first work on a
    cryptographically secured chain of blocks in 1991 (Scott, 1991). They wanted to
    implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992,
    Haber, Stornetta, and Bayer incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved
    its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into
    each block (Haber et al., 1991; Bayer et al., 1992; Narayanan et al., 2016). These
    were the stepping-stones for the development of Blockchain technology. From 2008
    onwards, many global technology developing companies and new startups started
    new Blockchain related products and services as this technology promises many
    advantages for businesses. In 2009, the first Bitcoin was mined and became available,
    in digital form, online. In the subsequent year, i.e. in 2010, through cryptocurrency
    stock exchange, Bitcoin was launched and trading went live. In 2014, Microsoft
    started accepting Bitcoin for its business payments. Now Bitcoin created a decentralized
    environment for cryptocurrency, where the participants could buy and exchange
    goods with digital money (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016).

    on open source technologies. Anybody across the globe can participate anytime
    from anywhere with any device; the public node is accessible through his or her
    individual machines or devices. In a Public Blockchain, anyone can participate
    as user, miner, developer, and community member. All these transactions are anonymous
    and transparent. In a simple way, it is a platform in which every participant
    in the network would be able to read on and write to. Anyone can use the source
    code without any other’s permission and run the code on their local systems as
    per the predefined rules in the Public Blockchain. The Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm
    is the backbone of the Public Blockchain. However, the auditing can be done by
    anybody in the network. One of the main advantages of this Public Blockchain configuration
    is the reduced need for special central database servers and system manager, thereby
    leading to cost reduction. These have, generally, a token association for designing
    to reward participants in the network. The examples for this category are Bitcoin,
    Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Dash, among others.

    Total privileges of reading and writing rights in the source code of blockchain
    are limited only to the owners/proprietors; and hence, sometimes also called as
    Closed Blockchain. These Blockchains normally reside within the organisations.
    A Private Blockchain has restrictions on access and on who can participate in
    transaction and validation operations. It is a platform in which only the owner
    of the blockchain has the right to make changes in rules or other terms and conditions.
    External consumers cannot run a full node, start mining, make transactions or
    audit the blockchain in a Blockchain explorer. Private Blockchain is private property
    of an individual or an organization. Private Blockchain networks are deployed
    for voting, digital identity, asset ownership, and supply chain management (SCM)
    etc. The transactions per second (TPS) rate is higher in the case of Private Blockchains;
    however, these are highly scalable. The general activities included in Private
    Blockchain are access, visibility, storage, and execution. The best example for
    this sort of blockchain is Bankchain. Another example is MONAX.

    Hence, these may be considered as semi-decentralized. The Consortium Blockchain
    provides efficiency and security of public blockchains while still allowing for
    some degree of central control, monitoring and safeguarding. Like Public Blockchain,
    these are distributed systems and like Private Blockchain, Permissioned Blockchains.
    Only permitted members with prior approval or voting can become the part of network
    to carry out the transactions. This kind of Blockchain is between the companies
    and among the organizations for their day-to-day to financial business operations.

    system, the digital ledger consists of records of digital transactions, maintained
    at multiple points within a network. Therefore, the online open distributed digital
    ledgers consist of different nodes in the form of users or computers or systems
    in the connected blockchain system. These users undertake the transactions at
    any time. The transactional data records are saved in the form of blocks, and
    added or inter-linked to the existing blocks in the blockchain. These digital
    ledgers are saved as separate files or else in a plain form in a database. These
    blocks are a kind of online data structure keeping all transactions in a distributed
    network. The chains are a sequence of blocks in a specific order with user, amount,
    place, date and time with the help of consensus algorithms. All these blocks are
    recognized by hash technique (e.g. SHA256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm) on the
    header of the block. Thus, the Distributed Digital Ledgers are at the heart of
    the entire Blockchain technology at the back-end level.

    of blockchain technology, Bitcoin mining has become highly popular (Qin et al.,
    2018). One of the most vital components in blockchain technologies is the mining
    process. The process is similar to the mining process of ores. In order to create
    new cryptocurrencies and transactions, this process plays an important role in
    Blockchain technologies. In mining, blocks are created in about 10 minutes each,
    after which the solvers of the computation challenges are rewarded currency (Lindman
    et al., 2017). Mining involves using specialized computer hardware to find a particular
    mathematical hash function, with the reward for success being payment in new bitcoins/cryptocurrencies
    (Easley et al., 2019). Miners are actors, who play a crucial role both in creating
    new cryptocurrencies and in verifying transactions on the blockchain. In Proof-of-Work-based
    blockchain networks, the block miners participate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition
    to win the reward of publishing i.e., mining new blocks (Liu et al., 2018). In
    Blockchain pool mining, Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares is one of the most commonly used
    reward mechanisms in practice, in which the mining pools will distribute the reward
    among the miners whose reported shares fall in the last N shares, according to
    the proportion of the number of shares of the miner in the last N shares (Qin
    et al., 2018).

    in Blockchain technology. There is a misconception about these terms that they
    are similar. The Proof-of-Work is abbreviated as PoW and Proof-of-Stake as PoS.
    Both of these are consensus mechanisms that allow distinguishing a valid from
    an invalid blockchain. This implies that this algorithm resolves the issue of
    trust between the participants of the network. Some studies state that Cynthia
    Dwork and Moni Naorin first mentioned the Proof-of-Work concept in 1993 in a journal
    article. However, some say that Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels coined the term
    “Proof of Work” in 1999\. In Bitcoin, hashing is used for ‘Proof of Work’, a mechanism
    that links consensus with computing power, making duplication of participants
    influential to consensus outcomes (Aste et al., 2017).

- en: As regards the Proof of Stake, it is a type of consensus algorithm. Some studies
    say that Proof of Stake is a substitute process for transaction verification on
    a blockchain. The role of Proof-of-Stake is to achieve distributed consensus in
    the blockchain network. In Proof-of-Stake based cryptocurrencies, the creator
    of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth
    or age, i.e. the stake. Proof-of-Stake means a form of proof of ownership of the
    currency. Coin age consumed by a transaction can be considered a form of Proof-of-Stake.
    We expect Proof-of-Stake designs to become a potentially more competitive form
    of peer-to-peer crypto-currency than Proof-of-Work designs due to the elimination
    of dependency on energy consumption (King & Nadal, 2012). The Proof-of-Stake consensus
    protocol is an interestingly attractive one, which provides the block-inclusion
    decision-making power to those entities that have stakes in the system irrespective
    of blockchain's length or history of the public ledger (Tosh et al., 2017).

    As automation is becoming the prime part of any kind of business, the contracts
    between two business parties are also becoming automatic, without any physical
    presence. The smart contracts are about the business rules implied by the agreement
    to do the transactions, where parties involved could be individuals or organizations.
    There is no third-party involvement in the process. These rules and regulations
    are developed and embedded in the blockchain technology and are encoded with the
    help of different programming languages.

    of mutually distrusting nodes, without the need of an external trusted authority
    (Atzei et al. 2017). The transactional agreements between businesses parties by
    the signatures are verifiable automatically with the help of predefined rules.
    The validation process of cryptocurrencies between individuals is done using digital
    signatures and ring signatures. Emerging smart contract systems over decentralized
    cryptocurrencies allow mutually distrustful parties to transact safely without
    trusted third parties (Kosba et al., 2016). Thus, this process reduces the cost
    of travelling, demands lesser material cost, requires lesser manual process, is

    relevance, as tampering with data may maliciously affect crucial business decisions
    (Gaetani et al., 2017). Data is a vital component in the entire financial transaction
    process as well. When the cryptocurrencies transactions from different participants
    are occurring between/among them, irrespective of the currency type, the exact
    amount of cryptocurrency conversion takes place automatically. The best part is
    that there are different interoperability techniques, that will help transactions
    with smoothening operations without failure. In most cases, the data is not at
    all centrally kept in one place. All the blocks of records of distributed ledgers
    are stored in the distributed environments with the help of miners witness as
    proof of transactions. As per the authors’ knowledge, central servers, the cloud
    storages and advanced storage paradigms like data lakes concepts may not be required,

    and consistency in transaction over the entire life cycle. It is also responsible
    for the design and usage of any blockchain system and the maintenance of data;
    that stores, processes, or retrieves data. When we create a transaction in a connected
    network and is added as a new record of the block to the chain, this block information
    cannot be modified or changed due to the blockchain technology's immutable nature.
    Each record, once stored at UCX using the trusted storage feature, will generate
    a unique hash for the file’s content. Put simply, the blockchain integration will
    ensure transparency, auditability and security of the information processed in
    the government systems. Due to its strong data integrity guarantees, blockchain
    can be employed to ensure log integrity, but its current performance limitations
    hinder actual exploitations (Aniello et al., 2017). Thus, data integrity in Blockchain

    is ensuring the privacy for the miner, giving authentication for sender and receiver,
    securing the transactions in the process end and minimizing the noise errors.
    The most attractive advantage of blockchain is that the public ledger cannot be
    modified or deleted after all nodes have approved the data. This is why blockchain
    is well known for its data integrity and security characteristics (Yli-Huumo et
    al., 2016). The degree of trust between users determines the technological configuration
    of a distributed ledger. The online ledger is shared in the network but at the
    same time, participants get the privacy of their own transactions. Identity of
    the online financial transactions are not linked to a transaction due to privacy
    concern, however, all the transactions are authenticated, while identity kept
    confidential. Besides, for the security of transactions, many cryptography tools
    and techniques are used at the node level to process these transactions smoothly.
    Cryptography techniques are the backbone for the blockchain technology. This term
    ‘cryptography’ is derived from two Latin words: crypto which means secret, and
    graph that means writing. That the entire cryptocurrencies transactions happen
    through secret writing between two parties. The RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm
    is a well-known cryptographic technique for data transmissions among security
    mechanisms of data communications. In effect, all the cryptocurrencies use private
    and public keys at the time of online transactions. The encryption key is public
    and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private). Based on
    the same technique, the blockchain technologies security mechanisms are developed
    for peer-peer secured transactions.'

    across the world. The survey reported that around 80 per cent of the respondents
    were either already employing some blockchain technology in their businesses,
    or were planning to do the same. The authors reported that the technology is being
    deployed even by the governments, for more transparency in services like transferring
    payments to public, for removing undesired red-tapes, etc. Wang and Filippi (2020)
    foresee blockchain as a huge contributor towards achieving a vision of a global
    self-sovereign identity system. While a sacrosanct definition is yet to emerge,
    self-sovereign identity can be generally defined as a system wherein individuals
    have the say in deciding what aspect of their personal identity information can
    be disclosed in different contexts (Wang & Filippi, 2020).

    in the above sections. Yet another set of sectors that embraced the blockchain
    technology include real estate and smart cities. Grover et al. (2019) report that
    the application of blockchain technology in the real estate sector has reached
    the confirmation stage of the innovation-decision process. The confirmation stage
    implies that the real estate sector has put the blockchain technology in use,
    and the results are better than the ones obtained from the previously applicable
    systems. Wouda and Opdenakker (2019) proposed a blockchain-based application that
    could improve the efficiency and the speed of transacting in any commercial real
    estate. Further, according to Laroiya et al. (2020), the real estate sector is
    expected to gain from the ability of blockchain to maintain data related to ownership
    records, which cannot be tampered with. Karamitsos et al. (2018) recognize benefits
    such as more efficient database management, easier to build trust among the parties
    involved, doing away with the requirements of intermediaries, and more effective
    invoice management. Moreover, it has applications in Smart Cities/Smart Urban
    spaces. According to Xie et al. (2019), blockchain as an emerging technology has
    many good features, such as trust-free, transparency, pseudonymity, democracy,
    automation, decentralization, and security. These features of blockchain are helpful
    to improve smart city services and promote the development of smart cities.

    sector. The collaboration targeted exploring the employment of Security Token
    Offering (STO) for the ownership of real estates (Lane, 2019). STO is a crypto
    token, which is issued to an investor as a proof of her/his investment in the
    underlying asset. What makes it different from the issuance of other documents
    as proof (viz., print or digital certificate) is the fact that the record of investment
    is maintained on a blockchain (Pauw, 2019). Further, the worth is enhanced as
    law recognizes the STOs. With the marriage of blockchain and real estate, many
    more applications are expected to be seen in times to come.

    in the world of blockchain, can be traced back to December 2016, when the firm,
    in partnership with blockchain-active firms like Digital Garage Inc., invited
    proposals for Toyota Next Open Innovation program. The aim was to employ innovative
    technologies and solutions for business problems. The Toyota Research Institute,
    in collaboration with Massachute Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab and other
    industry partners, announced exploring blockchain technology for developing mobility
    ecosystem (Toyota Canada Newsroom, 2017). In May 2017, the plan was announced
    with a belief of accelerating the progress of autonomous driving technique. In
    April 2019, The Toyota Motor Corporation and Toyota Financial Services Corporation
    together set up Toyota Blockchain Lab, a virtual organization for exploring the
    applications of blockchain in business ideas. In May 2019, the firm collaborated
    with The University of Tokyo and Trende Inc. to begin the testing of blockchain-based
    electricity trading system. The firms had a vision of developing next-generation
    electricity systems that could enable individuals and businesses to trade electricity
    among themselves.

    With a vision to improve the lifestyle in future, it is expected to be a ‘living
    laboratory’ for researchers, providing them with real-life environment for developing
    technologies (Toyota Woven City, 2020). The Toyota Blockchain Lab in March 2020
    announced its plan to pool in partner companies and thus, expand collaborations
    more than ever (Toyota, 2020). The Lab also worked on global collaboration among
    Toyota Group companies for symbiotic use of resources. Furthermore, the firm revealed
    development of a blockchain-based ID (Identifier) platform for individuals as
    well as vehicles, built in collaboration with Securitize (Bourne, 2020). The platforms
    can be employed multifariously i.e. personal ID platform can be harnessed by employers
    to maintain employee-related benefits; vehicle ID platform can be harnessed to
    maintain records related to vehicle registration, maintenance, and others. Figure
    7 summarizes the blockchain journey of Toyota. With many proposals already in
    pipeline, the best might yet to come from the visionary portfolio of Toyota.

    operating in the area of e-commerce. Headquartered in China, the Group was founded
    in 1999 (Alibaba Group, 2020). As of the end of 2019, the Group employed more
    than 116,000 employees. The Group is into multiple businesses, viz., commerce,
    cloud computing, innovation, digital media and entertainment. It might appear
    young by age, but it is mighty by deeds and has already proved its mettle in several
    fields. Alibaba.com is a leading platform for global wholesale and trade. In 2018,
    the company held the honour of being China’s largest integrated international
    online wholesale marketplace by revenue (Alibaba Group, 2020). The customer base
    of the company spreads across more than 190 countries. Besides, the company provides

    even the foundations of the Group was based on leveraging technologies. The founders
    believed that innovation and technology could be capitalized on, to provide a
    level playing field to a smaller business competing with bigger counterparts.
    The company endeavours to act as a platform for merchants and other business players
    to help them grow their market reach using new technologies. In 2017, Alibaba
    organized annual Computing Conference, with blockchain as one of the themes. One
    of its businesses already offers Blockchain as a Service (BaaS). In October 2018,
    the Group expanded the customer base for its offering BaaS to cover Asia, Europe
    and the United States. The Group also owns an initiative called ‘Charities on
    the Chain’, which is blockchain-based charity recordkeeping that provides transparency
    and traceability of donations (Ledger Insights, 2020).

    aim to explore the possible role of blockchain in fighting the problem of food
    fraud. A year later, in April 2018, Alibaba while shipping products (food items/health
    supplements) from Australia and New Zealand to China (Barbaschow, 2018) undertook
    a pilot test of applying blockchain for supply chain. The vice president of the
    Group had announced in March 2019 that the Group was considering the usage of
    blockchain for cross-border supply chain (Yakubowski, 2019). In March 2020, the
    group announced its plan to employ blockchain for its supply chain, with an objective
    of enhancing the transparency of the chain (Kastelein, 2020). It can enable the
    customers to track the source of origin and current position of goods in the supply
    chain. The customers can access the details about logistics for any product by
    scanning a Quick Response (QR) code (Peng, 2020). Peng (2020) also further reported

    technology are the network-operating sectors, especially energy and telecom. Andoni
    et al. (2019) report on the evident rise in the number of blockchain-based start-ups
    and projects in the energy sector. Based on their review, the authors conclude
    that the blockchain might be the answer to some of the problems thriving in this
    sector. Teufel et al. (forthcoming) argue that blockchain technologies can be
    employed for the trading of energy, storage of information, and achieving greater
    transparency in transactions. The authors coin the term ‘blockchain energy’ to
    refer to blockchain technologies employable in the energy domain. Acknowledging
    that the applications also involve challenges, the authors especially mention
    the need to address the challenge of cybersecurity. Further, anticipating that
    the future of the energy sector would involve a decentralization of energy generators,
    Worner et al. (2019) foresee blockchain to play a pertinent role in the process.

    of the telecom sector as well. Kabbinale et al. (2020) believe that with the onset
    of decentralization, blockchain technology would be the platform to record the
    economic aspects of the transactions in a transparent manner. Cryptocurrencies
    and smart contracts would also come to the rescue. Praveen et al. (forthcoming)
    propose that with the stepping up of 5G technology in the telecom, blockchain
    would provide the required enhanced privacy and security to the parties involved.
    Khalaf et al. (2020) propose a new algorithm of blockchain technology, that they
    perceive would be relevant for the new generation of telecom. Adding a different
    angle, Lee (2018) proposed the usage of blockchain for ID as a Service (BIDaaS),
    which could be employed for identity management of mobile users. Wang et al. (2019)

    2019). The installation partners of the company provide installation and maintenance
    services to owners of solar cells, who lease out their solar cells to business
    houses. This service puts in the hands of people in general, a source to earn
    money by merely owning solar cells and offering them on lease. With roots emanating
    from South Africa, the company was started in 2014, and the central idea that
    drove the founder was concerned about climate change. The founder’s realization
    about the speed, ease and efficiency of sending cryptocurrency for international
    remittance was what fits the piece of blockchain into this jigsaw puzzle. The
    payments to owners of solar cells are made either in local currency, or in cryptocurrency.
    As of March 2018, the company had members spread across 70 countries. As of 2019,
    the number rose to 155, a growth of 121 per cent in a year.

    the globe. In March 2018, the company launched SUNEX Network token sale for public,
    a platform to ‘monetize sunshine’ and earn cryptocurrency by leasing solar cells.
    It is proposed to act as an insurance fund for solar projects. Year 2019 brought
    many more awards and recognition, one of them being the Disruptor Daily’s Blockchain
    in Energy Use Case Awards. The company operates a blockchain-based framework that
    maintains records of owners of the solar cells and their earnings. Being tamper-proof,
    these records act as the basis for regulators to compute toll charges and apply
    through smart contracts. Records of both the consumers and the sellers are recorded
    on blockchain platform, and this eases the requirement of administering these
    records.

    to contribute in reducing carbon emission (Sun Exchange, 2019; Ellsmoor, 2019a).
    The company reports of having saved 1,280 tonnes of CO[2] as of 2019\. By resorting
    to solar energy, SE also contributes in saving the non-renewable sources from
    getting consumed. In addition, the projects also aid the consumers in saving their
    expenses on energy. The company has reported savings to the tune of 30 per cent
    by schools and other organizations. Talking about the applications of blockchain
    in the energy sector in general, Ellsmoor (2019b) states that many of the new
    entrants are employing blockchain technology for maintaining smart grid. By sharing
    data with consumers in real-time, the system enables them to choose their source
    of purchase of energy. This, in turn, enhances the efficiency of allocation and
    pricing, by making the market competitive. With the company so young and still
    in the stage of exploring and expanding, the benefits from application of blockchain
    in the energy sector are expected to boom in the times to come.

    hub to act as a platform for open collaboration and innovation. It attracted participation
    from various industries, and in its first year of operation, launched 100 projects
    on recent innovations like blockchain (Cangl, 2017). In April 2018, Nokia announced
    of entering into partnership with a blockchain start-up with an aim to make mobile
    connections available to remote rural population (Coleman, 2018). In May 2018,
    Nokia also announced of collaboration with a blockchain data platform Streamr
    (and a software company OSIsoft) to aid Nokia customers to control their own data,
    and to enter into transactions with IoT devices (Floyd, 2018). The participants
    can transact real-time data for cryptocurrency employing smart contracts. Nokia
    offers Sensing as a Service (SaaS) to its clients, who are operators. The service
    enables the operators to remotely monitor their network assets. While improving
    the operational efficiency of the service providers, this digitization also provides
    them a new source of revenue, the blockchain-based smart contracts for which are
    created automatically (Nokia, 2020c). In April 2019, Nokia’s SaaS was employed
    by an Israeli telecom company Cellcom Israel. The companies together also employed
    blockchain-based IoT data shop to enhance transparency of data and provide better
    innovation opportunities (Kfar-Saba, 2019). In August 2019, IBM, in collaboration
    with Nokia and other players, launched a blockchain network Trust Your Supplier
    (Crouse, 2019). The network aims to provide digital identities to suppliers, and
    thus improve supplier management. According to David Post, managing director of
    IBM Blockchain Ventures, the presence of Nokia and Vodafone as founding members
    of the platform would help in exploring the ways the network would benefit the
    telecom sector. More innovations, more collaborations, and the resulting ecosystems
    are sure to discover more ideas and bring for telecom, newer blockchain-based

    capability to conduct transactions anytime from anywhere with any device by anyone
    for smoothening financial operation in the network. Therefore, all organisations
    in finance, insurance, mobility, manufacturing, supply chain, judicial, governance,
    education, healthcare, energy, real estate, tourism, hotel and service sectors
    are attempting to adopt this technology for operational efficiency. From barter
    systems to coins minting, currency notes, credit/debit cards and even the online
    transactions and financial apps, none are comparable to this innovative disruptive

    financial operations. We are hearing a lot about cryptocurrencies, these days,
    which are essential in our daily transactions. Different digital currencies like
    Bitcoin, Blackcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, Tither, LibrexCoin, and Zcash are
    becoming popular but there are also concerns. The reason is that there is no clear
    official permission from the governments to adopt these cryptocurrencies for business

- en: Digital transformation strengthens the interconnection of companies in order
    to develop optimized and better customized, cross-company business models. These
    models require secure, reliable, and traceable evidence and monitoring of contractually
    agreed information to gain trust between stakeholders. Blockchain technology using
    smart contracts allows the industry to establish trust and automate cross-company
    business processes without the risk of losing data control. A typical cross-company
    industry use case is equipment maintenance. Machine manufacturers and service
    providers offer maintenance for their machines and tools in order to achieve high
    availability at low costs. The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate how maintenance
    use cases are attempted by utilizing hyperledger fabric for building a chain of
    trust by hardened evidence logging of the maintenance process to achieve legal
    certainty. Contracts are digitized into smart contracts automating business that
    increase the security and mitigate the error-proneness of the business processes.

    between companies, resulting and leading to complex business models with manifold
    cross-company relations. Building trust between all stakeholders and concerning
    all transactions is essential. A secure, reliable, immutable and traceable database
    supporting logging of actions, contracts and their fulfilment is necessarily required.

    be used to meet these requirements. Blockchains promise a reliable solution for
    decentralized accounting of involved stakeholders. It is well suited for safety-critical
    applications by using smart contracts for maintenance and monitoring with immutable
    logging. It provides the proof of authenticity for replacement parts through a
    documented supply-chain. All use cases in this chapter use private and permissioned
    blockchains. In contrast to popular public blockchain, there is no need for proof
    of work or proof of stake. All participants are required to authenticate themselves
    before they are allowed to join the network. Data-Blocks are added to the blockchain
    according to a consensus algorithm.

    business and service processes by promising advantages such as a more efficient
    business, fail-safety, a quicker market launch, process efficiency, and cost reduction.
    The immutability of data provides security and enables the use of reliable automatic
    contract execution. However, benefits and disadvantages of the transition have
    to be balanced wisely. The blockchains smart contracts permit controlled data
    sharing between machine tools, operators and service providers. A digitization
    of contractual agreements between stakeholders occurs and cross-company processes
    begin to prosper. Thus, Blockchain technology creates new value-added opportunities
    in the context of digitization by threatening intermediary-focused business models.
    Companies can join forces and form consortia to represent their interests, building
    even cross-industry infrastructure platforms (Gratzke et al., 2017).

    Blockchains can enable constant optimizations in the know-your-customer (KYC)
    processes (Moyano et al., 2017). Several projects have been found in supply chain
    management (SCM). The Everledger Project (www.everledger.io) uses IBM Hyperledger
    Fabric to secure the provenance of diamonds. A digital fingerprint of the diamond
    is created and stored in a blockchain to verify its provenance and ownership,
    and to store its characteristics so that all involved stakeholders, such as suppliers
    or intermediaries, can monitor transactions and each diamond’s provenance.

    is still human-centred. Today, maintenance tasks are still logged via paper-based
    checklists, which is an unreliable process for data collection. Doubts about the
    correctness in the maintenance may be created by inadequate, incomplete or even
    manipulated maintenance reports. Trust in maintenance can be ensured by combining
    blockchains with digital evidence and mitigation of identity frauds. For example,
    to protect against tampered RFID markers, the markers can be physically embedded
    within parts as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) (Zimmermann et al., 2019)
    or placed on surfaces in an irremovable way. The scan of this physical evidence
    can prove the identity of spare parts or can indicate execution steps of the maintenance
    process.

    This holds especially true for all the mechanical parts. With ongoing degradation,
    productivity decreases and susceptibility to failures increases. Maintenance plans
    are developed according to the maintenance concept, with the goal to determine
    the optimum frequency to perform maintenance in equipment, in order to ensure
    its availability (Duarte et al., 2006; Jin et al., 2009). As the observance of

    fatigue and inadequate operator training (MacKenzie et al., 2007; Whittingham,

    numbers of stakeholders involved in the maintenance process. A major source of
    human error are paper-based records and their processing (Barchard et al., 2011).
    Prime examples of problems with paper-based documents are poor handwriting (falsified

    of previously paper-based contracts. They do not replace legal business contracts;
    they refine and specify parts to be automated. Implementations of SC range from
    simple processes to very complex processes, covering as many tasks as possible.
    An example for a simple process is the monitoring of conditions, such as sensor
    values. Comparison of simple conditions always leads to a clear result. An example
    for a complex process is the verification of a chained process step with various
    stakeholders involved. The comparison of complex conditions does not always lead
    to clear results and must be dealt with by further checks in order to obtain clear
    results. One limitation that has to be observed is the avoidance of non-deterministic
    functions and values. These are, among other things, the retrieval of the current
    time with an accuracy of seconds, the generation of random numbers or the query
    of sensor values (Alharby et al., 2017; Vukolić, 2017). To obtain these potential
    non-deterministic values, e.g. sensor data, they are retrieved outside the smart
    contract and are used as input parameters of smart contracts.

    schema is introduced. The SCT splits the required knowledge to create a smart
    contract into two domains - maintenance and blockchain - allowing each domain
    expert to concentrate on his domain without worrying about the inner workings
    of the other domain. The blockchain expert develops the smart contract basis,
    suitable for the specific domain. The maintenance domain expert identifies the
    essential properties of the paper-based maintenance service manuals. As seen in
    Figure 6, maintenance service manuals are analysed and essential properties, such
    as name, date, service intervals, service prices, behaviour on error and liability
    among others are identified. Essential properties are filled into the smart contract
    template by the maintenance expert and the smart contract is automatically generated
    and stored within the blockchain for execution.

    developed by IBM (Hyperledger Foundation, 2020). Permissioned blockchains provide
    trust by restricting the user group while publishing all information to every
    participant. Therefore, the stakeholders have to know each other without trusting
    each other. An algorithm is used to achieve consensus about what is truth, whether
    a transaction is true according to the contracts and their referring data or not.
    The consensus algorithm raft will become byzantine fault tolerant in near future
    (IBM Corporation, 2020b). Smart Contracts are called Chaincode in Fabric and can
    be written in Go, node.js or Java (IBM Corporation, 2020a). Several client SDKs,
    which are used building applications to interact with Fabric, are provided in
    a number of different programming languages (Java, node.js, Python) (IBM Corporation,

    works for the ESR using blockchain is demonstrated in the following subsections.
    The use cases rely on the integration of BISS 4.0 which is described in detail
    later on. The stakeholders and procedures involved can be seen in Figure 7.

- en: The stakeholders built a consortium to transform business transactions concerning
    service contracts. The owner uses the ESR for production, maintenance tasks are
    carried out by internal and external staff. For external maintenance, a cleaning
    service is contracted. Warranty contracts between the owner and the manufacturer
    (OEM) rely on compliant maintenance tasks. There are applications (Capture Interface
    and Registry Application) to perform transactions on the shared blockchain, represented
    in HLF as a channel. Every stakeholder keeps a copy of the ledger, the complete
    history of all transactions. Smart contracts are reading the channel for new transactions
    to succeed or fail, yielding a judgment of their contract fulfilment. The smart
    contracts concerning maintenance are based upon either (i) the maintenance plan,
    provided by the OEM and based on historical data or (ii) the Preventive Maintenance
    (PM), a system observing the condition of the ESR and reacting adaptive. The PM
    is based on previous sensor-collected machine data, which is interpreted and used
    for maintenance scheduling. The PM uses Machine Learning Technology to predict
    appropriate intervals and types of maintenance.

    The financial impact of this incidence is subject to legal actions between the
    owner and the manufacturer (OEM). Both refuse compensation of costs. The blockchain
    is triggered to generate an audit trail. The audit trail reveals insufficient
    cleaning. The cleaning service did not perform all required cleaning tasks in
    time. This caused an increased wear due to the dust-laden air. The documented
    maintenance logs in the blockchain are used to identify the liability of the cleaning

    establishing trust reduces costs of contract processing. The precise monitoring
    of maintenance allows optimal operating of equipment enhancing productivity and
    reducing cost. The implementation of smart contracts is speeded up by modelling
    smart agreement contract templates. In addition, the reduced error-proneness of
    the process increases the security level.

- en: For the proposed transformation of maintenance processes, Hyperledger Fabric
    has been used. By using the BISS 4.0 platform, an infrastructure had been developed
    including identity management. The integration of machines into blockchain was
    discussed and maintenance processes were digitized as smart contracts.

- en: Despite the advantages of using blockchain technology, there are still some
    challenges such as the lack of complete contract digitization, scalability, secure
    incorporation of external information, data privacy protection, access management,
    etc. For some of these challenges, first solutions have been proposed in this
    chapter, although many of these are still under research. The outcome of this
    is to develop blockchain solutions regarding the maintenance topic, as most blockchain
    solutions focus solely on the traceability aspect within the supply chain topic.

    from the use of blockchain. One area is the dynamic machine payment, called “machine
    as a service” (EXOR, 2019). Two types of machine as a service are distinguished:
    payment per unit produced and selling of surplus production capacity. With the
    first type, a machine is sold to the customer at a low cost and an additional
    fee is charged per unit produced. With the second type, excess production capacity
    of a company can be sold to external companies, in order to utilize the machinery
    cost-efficient and generate additional income. Using “machine as a service”, the
    blockchain obtains the role of a broker for supply and demand, payment service
    provider and documentation provider for securing evidence. In the area of environmental
    protection and resource conservation in production industry, the use of blockchain
    allows establishing a transparent binning process. Production output that does
    not correspond to first-class quality is re-labelled. A transparent binning process,
    logged and traceable by blockchain technology, creates trust in binned products.'

- en: Even though the automotive industry was among the key players of the industrial
    revolution in the last century, striking transformations experienced in other
    sectors did not have significant repercussions on this industry until a few years
    ago. However, general advancements in technology and Industry 4.0 have presented
    new opportunities for the reconfiguration of the business environment. Developments
    in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, in particular, have attracted the attention
    to what is known as blockchain technology. Several successful examples of blockchain
    applications in different industries have tempted the automotive industry to be
    rapidly involved with efforts in this direction. As a consequence, the application
    of the blockchain technology to highly diverse areas in the automotive industry
    was set in motion. The purpose of this chapter is to explore the application of
    blockchain technology in the automotive industry, to analyse its advantages and
    disadvantages, and to demonstrate its successful in general.

- en: The Blockchain (BC) technology has revolutionized several areas of society including
    manufacturing, commerce, banking, healthcare, automotive, and supply chain, to
    name but a few. The innovative approach of the BC which is based on trust and
    value is one of the primary attractive points of this revolution which offers
    new ways of doing business. Even though the automotive industry did not get acquainted
    with full digitalization until recently, it had and still has great potential
    for the future of personal mobility (Colonna, 2018). Today, along with the advancement
    of technology, the automotive industry has transformed from internal combustion
    engine vehicles to hybrid and electric automobiles. By virtue of the use of Industry
    4.0 technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV),
    Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics (BDA), Robotics, Blockchain and Mobile Services
    and Technologies in the industry, the automotive industry began to become one
    of the most technologically advanced industries alongside the transformation of
    conventional vehicles to autonomous (self-driving) automobiles in line with its
    adaptation to the changing innovations. The fourth industrial revolution represents
    a new level of organization and control of the entire value creation chain across
    the life cycle of products. This cycle typically addresses the increasingly individualized
    customer demands, that range from the initial purchase order, to the development
    & production, to the delivery of a product to the end-user and, in the end, to
    the recycling process including the relevant services (Çetin Gerger, 2019; Kern
    & Wolff, 2019; Fraga-Lamas & Fernández-Caramés, 2019; Reinsel, Gantz, & Rydning,
    2018).

    a very large amount of data is getting to be produced. To illustrate this point,
    the amount of data produced by an autonomous automobile is typically approximately
    1 gigabyte every second. When this figure is benchmarked against data produced
    by all the autonomous vehicles used in a single metropolis alongside the growing
    number of autonomous automobiles with each passing day and against similar sources
    of data, a figure hugely enormous in size comes into view. Along with the generation
    of such an enormous amount of data, the need not only for safely storing data
    but also for statistically analysing and interpreting it comes to the forefront.
    As per the estimates of International Data Corp (IDCC), the amount of data generated
    across the globe, currently, is expected to reach around 175 zettabytes (ZB) by
    2025 whilst it was 33 ZB in 2018\. In view of the fact that 1 ZB is 1 trillion
    gigabytes, that is, 10^(21) (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes, its manipulation
    requires new methods for analytics (Gerger, 2020; Gerger, 2019a; Gerger, 2019b;
    Pepper, 2012), and that is where Big Data techniques comes in.

    to different and heterogeneous stakeholders positioned in the life cycle of vehicles
    production; the stakeholders being individual and corporate vehicle owners, service
    users, customers of logistics businesses or end-users. Industry 4.0 contributes
    to advancement in multiple domains which allow the positioning of sensors in large

    a variety of features and services. However, they bring about malicious attacks
    and additional risks which make cybersecurity even a more challenging issue. In
    scenarios in which the controlled systems are vehicles or vehicle-related systems,
    the public security becomes a matter of importance. Therefore, providing powerful
    cybersecurity services becomes a basic necessity (Blanco-Novoa, Fernández-Caramés,
    et al., 2018; Fraga-Lamas, Fernández-Caramés, et al., 2018; Fraga-Lamas, Fernández-Caramés,
    et al., 2017). To this end, the automotive industry employs the Blockchain technology
    in order to optimize workings of all partners within the supply chain system.

- en: The Blockchain technology refers to a large database or a distributed ledger
    system which is shared across a computer network. When a transaction is performed
    between two parties, it is added as the next block (within a Blockchain) after
    its verification using the consensus mechanism which is part of the Blockchain.
    The new verified block is then appended and linked to the previous last block.
    If a transaction is added to the BC, it becomes irreversible as response to alterations.
    Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are also stored in BC. They
    contain all rules, terms & conditions, expiry dates and other related information
    that are necessary for the management of interaction between all relevant parties.
    Upon the fulfillment of terms & conditions of the smart contracts, the code is
    automatically executed. Smart contracts are stored within the Blockchain and these
    become operational upon the dispatch of a transaction to its address, and after
    it is verified and published across the general network (Mohanta, Panda, & Jena,
    2018; Lee, Chua, Keoh, & Ohba, 2019).

    autonomous driving functionalities and will rely heavily on other vehicles, road
    infrastructure and a variety of cloud services. These data which are acquired
    through wireless interconnections will be used by any smart vehicle for enriching
    its own database which is composed of data collected via installed sensors such
    as cameras and radar systems for the purpose of further enhancing the security
    of autonomous driving functionalities. Moreover, they will facilitate the solution
    of problems such as driver’s fatigue or distraction. Furthermore, data collected
    from vehicles which are equipped with limited smart technologies will be utilized
    far beyond just helping vehicle drivers during the trip (Stocker, Kaiser, & Fellmann,

    and, therefore, in a constant development and change. An automobile or a vehicle
    requires the assembly of more than 20,000 parts which originate from thousands
    of suppliers across the world. In this sense, it has the most sophisticated supply
    chain of the world and is located in a highly competitive environment. The firms
    which operate in this industry aspire to improving the product quality and delivery,
    to cut down equipment and labor costs, wastefulness and fragility in the supply
    chain, and to develop engineering skills in the best manner. Low-quality components
    which enter the supply chain are likely to cause the vehicle manufacturers to
    have serious problems (Kern & Wolff, 2019; Hoyle, 2005). The main property of
    a product/service, which is required to satisfy customer needs or to be appropriate
    for the customer use, is the quality (Hoyle, 2000; Gerger, 2018; Gerger & Firuzan,
    2020). Thus, the manufacturer alone does not have the full responsibility for
    all parts of any products used (Clarke, 2005); rather all parties across the supply
    chain share the collective responsibility. In today’s world in the era of Industry
    4.0 where everything is digitally connected to each other, all parties already
    have shared responsibility. Industry 4.0 represents a new level of organization
    of and control over the entire value creation chain during the life cycle of products.
    A vision of this fourth industrial revolution is to have the ability to auto control
    the machines and production systems based on data collected from connected devices.
    The most crucial characteristic of Industry 4.0 is the digitalization and automation.
    The digitalization in corporations alters business and operation models and develops
    and transforms supply chains and production methods for obtaining higher levels
    of reliability, agility and productivity. While the automotive industry was initially
    focused just on producing and selling automobiles, it has a more sophisticated
    ecosystem today. The stakeholders of this ecosystem are several, as presented
    in the list below (Fraga-Lamas & Fernández-Caramés, 2019; IBM Institute for Business

    Here, the factory constantly adapts to changes in the demand and supply and process
    deviations. It is observed that developments in the automotive industry took place
    in the last few years in particular. As per the results of the research by Capgemini
    (2019), while the ratio of interest of automotive firms in smart factories was

- en: The BC is a technology which makes it possible to keep record of irreversible
    data of the distributed ledgers in a safe and encrypted format and, in no way,
    allows the retroactive alteration of transactions. The concept of Blockchain (BC)
    was, for the first time, introduced in 2008 in relation to Bitcoin by Satoshi
    Nakamoto. The BC offers a technological structure for challenging business problems.
    The Blockchain is defined as a decentralized distributed ledger which securely,
    verifiably and transparently stores all transactions executed across a peer-to-peer
    network. Data in this decentralized distributed ledger changes on the basis of
    the BC design. If the Blockchain is designed for the purpose of money transfers,
    as in the case of Bitcoin, then data about such transactions is stored in a block.
    If the Blockchain is designed for a supply chain, then all data that is supposed
    to be stored in the system across the supply chain are stored in many blocks.
    The block size is determined by the system. When a new block needs to be created,
    a structure called the Miner plays a key role in determining which blocks will
    be added to the system. These structures enable the processing of data which exist
    in blocks. In the BC technology, a new transaction to be added to the system is
    first created. This new operation (of creating a block) is posted across the network
    for verification and control, and, when the majority of nodes across the Blockchain
    approve this transaction in accordance with predetermined and previously authorized
    rules, this transaction is added to the chain as a new block. This transaction
    is recorded on several distributed nodes for ensuring the security. The feature,
    called Smart Contract and known as a critical property of the BC technology, provides
    the opportunity to perform safe transactions without the involvement of any third
    parties. These transactions come into being alongside a consistent verification
    process thanks to another network mechanism called Consensus. Upon the verification
    of the new record and its addition to the Blockchain, multiple copies are created
    in a decentralized manner in order to create the new Blockchain. Hence, by virtue
    of the BC technology, several problems in products/services such as traceability,
    compatibility, flexibility and the management of partners are eliminated (Emen,
    2018; Güneşli, Yıldızbaşı & Eras, 2020; Kosba, Miller, Shi, et al., 2016; Saberi,
    Kouhizadeh, Sarkis & Shen, 2018; Liu, Kadıyala, & Cannistraci, 2018). On account
    of omitting the third party in conducting transactions, the security and productivity
    of transactions are enhanced and transaction costs are lowered (Dabbagh, Sookhak,
    & Safa, 2019).

    the system with security (Kalita, Boro, & Bhattacharyya, 2020). Each block is
    added to the compound value of the preceding blocks, and thus, it is cryptographically
    chained to the preceding blocks thereby assuring the integrity of the Blockchain.
    As long as an attacker does not take possession of the greater part of the network
    (which is highly unlikely), the Blockchain can prevent double-spending entries
    and inverse transactions. For admitting a newly proposed block, Blockchain systems
    rely on a consensus algorithm (Davi, Hatebur, Heisel, & Wirtz, 2019).

- en: As the Blockchain provides safer and traceable transactions, better access to
    information and transparency, it has the potential to promote the trust and cooperation
    between consumers and even vehicles. Advantages to be offered by the BC technology
    to the automotive ecosystem are to promote the cooperation between participants
    and to activate skills necessary for new business models of mobility. As well
    as activating a single source of data, the Blockchain can facilitate device-to-device
    transactions, smart contracts and real-time processing and locating. For automotive
    industry, the transparency of this supply chain signifies improvements and operational
    productivity in areas such as financial transactions between ecosystem participants,
    the verification of access to automobiles, customer experience and loyalty (IBM
    Institute for Business Value, 2018). However, data security is of high importance
    to the promotion of competitiveness and the protection of corporate secrets in
    the automotive industry. Without ensuring the data security, corporations acknowledge
    that systems should remain flexible enough to respond to the changing market conditions
    and customer needs even if they do not believe that new technologies will be extensively
    used. It is predicted that this topic will turn to be even more important in the
    future along with growing volume of data and computational advancements. Analyzing
    data with today’s technology is remarkably effortless. For the purpose of eliminating
    the risks associated with the third parties, corporations store data in their
    own servers in countries which have the supportive regulatory framework. In such
    countries, corporations utilize firewalls and systems which have no internet access.
    Moreover, data are generally categorized in terms of sensitivity, and instructions
    specify the security category of data to be stored and where it should be stored.
    On the other hand, while certain data should be secured by corporations, some
    other data should be shared with partners in the supply chain. The data security
    should be ensured across the entire supply chain with more powerful interconnection
    systems. A disruption in its weakest entity poses a security threat to the entire
    network (Kern & Wolff, 2019).

    (work in progress) data for the assembly of each vehicle starting from the quality
    control records, which are created during the production process, to the final
    stage. Prior to introduction of Blockchain, an automobile manufacturer was obliged
    to wait for a few weeks or months before receiving the payment for a delivered
    vehicle from an importer/distributor/seller. The manufacturer was put through
    a slow flow of documentation owing to the multiple parties that controlled different
    steps in the supply chain. Through a Blockchain -based system, the process is
    shortened by ensuring the creation of transparency of information between multiple
    parties for the purpose of verifying banking documents and processing them faster.'

    is comprised of a variety of suppliers, distributors, dealers, regulatory agencies,
    insurance companies and so on. A Blockchain-based system can provide transparency
    between different parties. By using the BC technology in the supply chain, logistics
    services can be punctually developed, the number and costs of erroneous orders
    are lowered and inventory turnover is increased. As the Blockchain is highly secure,
    it is ideal for keeping records in between different parties. Relations between
    raw material suppliers, automotive suppliers, OEMs, dealers, repair shops, online
    after-sale retailers and other stakeholders include multiple parties in general
    and these parties are expected to reach a consensus over the agreement. Each party
    performs transactions in full security via the Blockchain instead of being directly
    involved in verifying and reconciling the transactions. For example, in case automobile
    parts were stolen, replaced and damaged in the delivery, it was assured that the
    manufacturer followed up these parts with full accuracy via the Blockchain concept.
    In the case of recalls, recall procedure is also facilitated as the Blockchain
    contains data on the history of the broken part. Whether the part had any modification

    have in general no idea about drivers’ real driving behaviors or repair and maintenance
    service history of the vehicle. A Blockchain-based system enables the exchange
    of information on driving models and repair and maintenance service history with
    a ledger which can be accessed by all parties. Data obtained about the wear and
    tear of a vehicle by means of the Blockchain automatically help the finance provider

    case of both vehicle-to-vehicle and object-to-object secure communications. Today,
    autonomous vehicles establish communication with other vehicles, traffic lights
    and other unauthenticated devices. BC technology ensures that the communication
    is securely established only between relevant objects. Thus, unauthenticated persons
    are prevented from hacking these operations. A connected vehicle contains software-based
    navigation, vehicle-to-vehicle communication and several services which are likely
    to affect the security of vehicle and passenger. The Blockchain can be used for
    securely storing data which are sent and received by the systems. The enhanced
    encryption level prevents computer hackers from accessing or using these data.
    Along with the growth in the number of autonomous vehicles, millions of devices
    are in constant communication with each other. Therefore, it is essential that
    shared data be stored in safe databases requiring high-level authentication. Data
    which are shared in a ledger among automotive OEMs, part distributors, dealers,
    repair shops, insurance companies and other parties allow the part and equipment
    within the vehicle to recognize their own needs independently. For instance, a
    communication network of a car can offer recommendations to the driver about the
    repair needs of the car, and can communicate with remote users for updates or
    with suppliers in close proximity for spare parts. It can negotiate the price
    and arrange appointments for the service and subsequently process the payment

    to have fatal consequences. A Blockchain is an ideal place for storing data as
    data cannot be altered by virtue of strong cryptographic basis of the Blockchain
    technology which cannot be reverse-engineered. For instance, a common practice
    of an unethical car dealer is to sell a showroom vehicle and not to present information
    on this sale to the bank which provided the car dealer with loan for this vehicle.
    This practice enables the dealer to have the working capital necessary to pay
    for the wages of its employees and the supplies. If the bank finds about this
    undue process in time, it will immediately take action against the dealer. On
    the other hand, the bank can have no claim directly on the vehicle as the vehicle
    is sold legally, and at the same time, the financing extended to the dealer was
    already used. Alongside the transparency of data, the information asymmetry which
    makes this practice possible will not come into play. The BC technology instantaneously
    provides transparency, and provides more valuable service with the participation
    of more parties. It completely prevents such unethical operations.'

    company exchanges information with the relevant parties in the case of accidents
    or other cases where the need arises. As the data are stored by means of BC technology,

    first, to perform a well-structured situation analysis. To this end, analyzing
    the weaknesses and strengths of the firm is necessary for making a powerful start
    on Blockchain applications. Even though several techniques are utilized in this
    context, SWOT analysis which is one of the powerful tools of strategic management
    was preferred in this book chapter. The name SWOT is derived from the first letters
    of the words, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. This analysis
    is the comparison of opportunities and threats identified through the external
    analysis to the findings of the internal analysis, that is, organization’s strengths
    and its weaknesses which are conducive to improvement (Hill & Westbrook, 1997;
    Özan, Polat, Gündüzalp, & Yaraş, 2015). In the application phase of the BC technology

    third party for facilitating digital relationships, in recording and disseminating
    data. Even if there were several cases of the application of Blockchain in different
    sectors of the global economy, Blockchain applications intended for the automotive
    industry mostly remained at experimental and environmental level. That is the
    reason that the challenge for automotive industry is the conceptualization of
    a project which will spread the revolutionary benefits of this destructive technology
    to the entire automotive ecosystem (Carnomic, 2020). To this end, the automotive
    industry should get acquainted with existing circumstances which will challenge
    it during the application of BC technology and seek solutions to these challenging
    circumstances. Fraga-Lamas and Fernández-Caramés (2017) have summarized certain
    potential inherent challenges in Blockchain applications to the said industry.
    These are listed in Table 6.

    several facets of the automotive industry. The Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative
    (MOBI) event in May 2018 is the most obvious manifestation of the increased pace
    of the Blockchain revolution in the automotive sector. On this occasion, big car
    makers such as BWW, GM, Ford, Bosch and Renault Groupe and the leading Blockchain
    and technology enterprises such as IBM, Accenture, and ConsenSys came together.
    A further two-day colloquium which brought all MOBI members together was held
    in BMW Group IT Center in Munich in February 2019\. The priority of the activity
    was designated as the promotion and development of common standards for enabling
    the implementation of Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in
    the mobility industry. Founders of MOBI aimed to use the BC technology with a
    view to shaping a mobility future which would be greener and safer and would raise
    the quality of life in cities. Moreover, the group works diligently on the areas
    of application of the Blockchain for making the mobility more secure, inexpensive
    and accessible.

- en: Big Data refers to data clusters which are characterized by big volume, high
    speed and diversity (Govindan, Cheng, Mishra, & Shukla, 2018). Prior to the fourth
    industrial revolution, in order to perform a statistical analysis about a population,
    a sample was required from the population based on the characteristics of the
    areas of interest. However, as accessing data is easy considering the necessary
    technologies being already available, it is possible to perform analysis directly
    on the population. With each passing day, these developments raise the importance
    of statistics even more in today’s super intelligent society. For selecting the
    necessary data from among such large amount of data and analyzing them, the concept
    of Big Data came to the forefront. The concept of big data which appeared in 1997
    for the first time (Cox and Ellsworth, 1997) was referred to in an article titled
    ‘Application Controlled Demand Paging for Out-of-Core Visualization’ which addressed
    the issue of insufficiency of storage devices (computer rams, external and internal
    hard disks and so on.) due to the large size of datasets (Cox & Ellsworth, 1997;
    Gerger, 2020). Big data is a new concept which defines any heterogeneous data
    that appear to be impossible to process through conventional database techniques
    (Gahi, Guennoun, & Mouftah, 2016). Big data is generated through several sources;
    some of the most renowned being sensors, smart devices (watches and bracelets),
    medical equipment, tablets, mobile phones, records of website use, social media,
    simulations, and so on (Schneider, 2012).

    grow rapidly, creating networks gradually becomes more relevant to all domains
    and industries (Wu, Zhu, Wu, & Ding, 2014). It is the domain of big data analysis
    which supplements big data, and known also as the business intelligence and analytics.
    By analyzing critical business data, firms can better understand their businesses
    and markets, and take business decisions on time (Chen, Chiang, & Storey, 2012).

    data analytics as a key opportunity for the future. By establishing a strategic
    partnership with IBM, the firm has already made efficiency enhancements in the
    production, by using the self-learning algorithms especially designed for big
    data analytics. In another example, cycle time of assembly stations is summed
    and analyzed to find out the probabilities of the process optimization such as
    the line balancing or raw material relocation (Kern & Wolff, 2019).

    of other areas of application of the BC technology, will expand considerably.
    For this reason, it is important that all shareholders positioned in the automotive
    supply chain, particularly the big actors of the sector, invest in the BC technology
    and also train their employees for the required skills. Thus, in the industry
    with an already fiercely competitive atmosphere, firms will gain an advantage
    in terms of promoting the customer satisfaction.

- en: The fragmented and disorganized nature of data in healthcare poses a variety
    of challenges to scientific research and medical applications. This mainly stems
    from the lack of traceability of transactions, complex disconnected networks,
    and lack of data interoperability. This complexity leads to difficulties in conducting
    research and clinical trials, and to the problem of counterfeit drugs in the market.
    This triggers lack of availability and accessibility of data for researchers and
    medical experts. Blockchain technology offers comprehensive solutions to these
    problems, and hence it has been of enormous interest in the healthcare sector.
    Blockchain technology with its innate transparency, traceability, data security,
    and distributed nature can help to overcome the data related problems in healthcare.
    This chapter provides an overview of the use of blockchain in the healthcare industry
    and explores various use-cases and applications. This chapter also discusses case-studies
    and various challenges faced while adapting blockchain in the healthcare industry.

- en: Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed data sharing platform
    without the need of a central authority. Transactions in blockchain are innately
    secure, tamperproof and trustworthy due to cryptographic algorithms and proof
    of work feature of consensus algorithms. In recent years, use of blockchain and
    digital ledger technologies have gained traction and entered different domains,
    largely due to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. After gaining popularity as
    a distributed ledger technology used for the implementation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency,
    blockchain has gained popularity in non-financial domains and hence is now considered
    as a general-purpose technology (Jovanovic et al, 2005).

    technologies and a variety of use-cases have been developed with the help of blockchain.
    Studies have shown a wide range of possibilities with the use of blockchain in
    healthcare. The main areas of application include Electronic Health Records (EHR),
    personal patient data, medical records storage systems, clinical trial support
    systems, data management for connected devices, administrative systems, and supply
    chain in the pharmaceutical industry.

    access control, data integrity and provenance which are some of the major challenges
    in the healthcare industry today. Blockchain enables the secure transfer of information
    amongst researchers, healthcare professionals and patients. It can be used to
    build integrated health management systems across different institutions, healthcare
    systems and clinics. It also enables efficient electronic health records and personal
    health record managements, which are an essential part of modern healthcare industry.
    Moreover, this also facilitates seamless data accessibility for biomedical and
    bioinformatics researchers, paving way for better scientific collaborations and
    research. Provenance is one of the key advantages of blockchain and it plays an
    impeccable part in the pharmaceutical supply chain, especially to prevent counterfeit
    drugs and adulterations in medicine.

    by blockchain. Moreover, the use of blockchain can also improve interoperability
    while preserving the confidentiality and security of data. It conforms to strict
    regulations in terms of the handling and storage of sensitive data and it contains
    inherent integrity.

    healthcare systems. The drawbacks of conventional healthcare systems will be overcome
    by the next generation healthcare systems, that would be intelligent, better connected,
    collaborative, secure by design, and will focus on inclusive user experience.
    Artificial intelligence can munch on petabytes of data from distributed systems
    and generate meaningful insights about the libraries of chemical compounds, natural
    products, extracts, and active agents throughout the drug discovery. A wearable
    wristwatch or a personal health assistant on mobile devices could identify conditions
    of medical emergencies like heart failure, diabetes, asthma attacks, etc. and
    alert the physician. Similarly, Augmented Reality is helping to model the novel
    discoveries and make them accessible for academia. The convergence of digital
    technologies such as Machine learning, IoT, Blockchain, and Augmented Reality
    will bring an unprecedented level of collaboration, trigger innovation in medical
    research, and facilitate newer concepts like precision medicine, population health,
    and help to create decision support systems for physicians. Blockchain enables
    trust, data integrity, data security, verifiability and better control over sensitive
    information moving between many devices, organizations, platforms and algorithms.

    in the aging population, there has been a considerable increase in the cost of
    healthcare and a growing risk of chronic diseases. Perhaps a more meaningful and
    long-term benefit lies in precision genome medicine. Currently, genome sequencing
    is finding its use in cancer research, characterizing genetic disease, and in
    predicting an individual's probable response to treatment. Advancement in the
    genome research together with technologies such as machine learning and blockchain
    would help to create a global genome knowledge repository or decision support
    database (Mattick et al., 2014). The global decision support systems could drastically
    improve the diagnosis and therapy for chronic diseases, personalized drug prescription,
    and pre-empting an epidemic based on the larger population data.

    to be struggling because of aging populations, rising healthcare costs, a growing
    number of patients with complex health conditions. Healthcare providers are a
    team of multidisciplinary experts and healthcare professionals to deliver healthcare
    services. Predominantly the interaction with the healthcare professionals have
    been dominated by the doctors or physicians. With a more patient-centric approach
    where several interdisciplinary professionals are involved in the care plan, it
    becomes extremely important to maintain a patient health record centrally. This
    record must be secure and most importantly provides an accurate track of the patient’s
    health records since the very beginning.

    of a health condition which existed years before. Several healthcare start-ups
    and industry veterans have taken up this challenge and using blockchain for building
    the new generation of smart solutions. Although extensive theoretical research
    has been conducted on the use cases involving blockchain in healthcare, there
    are many challenges and hurdles in implementing such solutions in the healthcare

- en: INDUSTRY CHALLENGES
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the major challenges faced by industry is in the supply chain management.
    The amount of fraud and counterfeit items in the drug supply chain are extremely
    high. Studies estimate that almost $455 billion of world healthcare spending is
    lost due to fraud or corruption (Button & GEE, 2015). WHO states that damages
    from counterfeit medicine cost over billions of dollars every year and is a deeply
    concerning problem, especially in developing countries. In more than 50% of the
    cases, drugs purchased over the Internet from websites without physical address
    have been found to be counterfeit (WHO bulletin, 2010). Interpol says that up
    to 1 million people die every year due to counterfeit drugs (Southwick, 2013).
    With all these counterfeit drugs, the amount of recalls is vast. During a drug
    recall, either counterfeit drugs, or non-counterfeit but tainted drugs, all those
    medicines need to be removed from the shelves of stores and from people’s possession.
    The problem with this is that only some of the drugs do need to be recalled, not
    all of them. Because we would rather be safe than sorry, we remove all of them
    unnecessarily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second major problem in the industry is about data breaches. According to
    IBM, the average cost of a data breach in the healthcare industry is $6.5 million
    (IBM Security, 2019). Between 2009 and 2018, there were over 189 million healthcare
    records stolen in the US alone which is over 59% of the entire US population (HIPAA,
    2019). Drug abuse is another major problem in the healthcare industry. According
    to (NIDA, 2018), the Opioid crisis is continuing to grow and 18 million people
    misused medication in 2017.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the healthcare and life sciences industry, health records are not standardized,
    and the owners of records are the institutions where the information is gathered.
    This is a problem for patients because if they want to switch doctors or bring
    their records somewhere else for a different reason, there is no one place, they
    can go to collect these records. The result is that there is no single comprehensive
    record of a patient’s health which makes diagnosing more difficult for doctors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another problem in the industry refers to concerns relating to medical researchers.
    The FDA estimates that almost 10% of clinical trials monitored feature mislabelled
    or mishandled data (FDA, 2013). Medical scientists have to collect their own patient
    data because they do not have consent to all patient’s records or their records
    are not as accurate as they could be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cold chain logistics is yet another challenge in healthcare industry. Certain
    drugs need to stay refrigerated from production to consumption. This means that
    delivery trucks need to be refrigerated and the medicine must not rise above a
    specific critical temperature. If the drugs go above the prescribed temperature,
    they may not function correctly. Currently, there is no specific way to monitor
    the individual drug temperature levels. While the truck can be equipped with a
    temperature-controlled refrigeration unit, it is not necessarily providing constant
    feedback where the alert can be triggered when the critical temperature is surpassed.

- en: Regulatory Landscape
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The healthcare industry is one of the most regulated industry. However, data
    breaching issues are on rise as the technology improves. Because of these breaches
    as well as technology advances, there have been increased rules and regulations.
    Most of these regulations concern patient privacy. Regulatory policies like HIPAA
    (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in US, and GDPR (General
    Data Protection Regulation) in Europe, aim to protect individual’s medical records
    and privacy. There are other US policies like the Medical Device Reporting (MDR)
    that mandate streamline reporting of medical device issues. Another policy that
    aims to streamline efficiency and make records reporting easier is HITECH whose
    goal is to motivate the adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR). The policies
    like Integrating Healthcare Enterprises (IHE) create standards for easier and
    streamlined reporting. The Centres for Medicare and Medicaid have also been collecting
    and analysing records to uncover fraud. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA)
    mandates that by 2023, every product requires to be trackable, accessible, and
    unalterable by all parties along a product’s chain of ownership (DSCSA, 2015).
    The goal is to combat counterfeit drugs and also to aid in drug recalls as it
    is easier to note exactly which drugs are tainted and need to be removed from
    the system.

    their own data and this will increase productivity tremendously. However, every
    time that a patient pays visit to a new physician, their profile needs to be rebuilt
    through many questions and answers. The problem with this approach is that it
    is difficult for the patients to remember about all the doctors they have visited,
    treatments they have undergone and tests that they have taken. This could lead
    to loss of critical information and can be difficult for the doctor to diagnose

    to tackle the issue of counterfeit drugs by tracking the movement of drugs throughout
    the lifecycle (Sylim, 2018). Several industries like manufacturing, retail, and
    mining, have applied blockchain or digital ledger technologies to build solutions
    to their supply-chain related challenges like provenance, proof of custody, inventory
    auditing and traceability. Blockchain’s inherent design features of decentralization,
    encryption methods and immutable record-keeping, ensures that associated data
    can be distributed among stakeholders securely. In pharmaceutical industry similar
    methods can be utilised to prevent counterfeit medicines from entering the supply
    chain. Regardless, blockchain should not be considered as a replacement of the
    existing landscape in the supply chain. It is aimed at complementing the current
    IT system with the benefits of an immutable and shared ledger.

    storage, transportation and in addition, they may need intensive monitoring and
    clinical oversight. Several stakeholders are involved in the end to end distribution

    and controlled by the healthcare providers. Getting a consolidated view of medical
    history, diagnosis and treatment becomes a challenge. For instance, if a patient
    consulted two different hospitals or providers for any medication for diagnostics
    services, the patient needs to go back to the individual providers and seek the
    medical records or the prescriptions. The current health services mostly revolve
    around the hospital or the provider. Additionally, there is no assurance of data
    privacy. The healthcare providers or institutions are often reluctant to share
    the health record data because of privacy concerns, and the fear that the shared
    data may be used to the competitive advantage of the others. This also leads to
    medication errors because of inaccurate or incomplete medical records between
    healthcare providers. An accurate health information exchange can benefit the
    patients by significantly reducing the healthcare costs, minimizing errors because
    of missing records and better coordination of care between different specialties

    means of a QR code, email or electronic message (Kim J.W et al, 2019). The hash
    of the medical records is stored on the blockchain for future verification against
    any a possible attempt of tampering. The ownership of such patient-centric medical
    health record resides with the patient or their legal guardian and can be produced
    to a pharmacy or another provider with a time bound consent from the patient.
    The receiver of such medical records could easily verify the records against the

    and control for shared medical data in cloud repositories among big data entities.
    MedShare monitors entities that access data for malicious use from a data custodians’
    system (Xia et al., 2017). Data transitions, transactions and data sharing between
    entities and all other actions performed on the MedShare system, are recorded
    in a tamper-proof manner. The design employs smart contracts and an access control
    mechanism to effectively track the behaviour of the data across the system. If
    any malicious activity or violation of regulation is detected, access is immediately
    suspended. MedShare achieves data provenance and auditing while sharing medical
    data with entities such as research and medical institutions with minimal risk
    to data privacy.

    to ensure data immutability and public accessibility of records. They also considerably
    reduce operational costs in traditional pharmaceutical supply-chains. The medical
    industry has many complex and strict environmental control process like temperature
    and humidity to ensure quality control and regulatory compliance over the transport
    of medical products. The sensor devices monitor the temperature of each parcel
    during the shipment to ensure adherence to regulations. This sensory data is transferred
    to the blockchain where a smart contract assesses against the product attributes.

    on the foundation of blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative (Ahram et al,
    2017). The system is transferable to a wide range of industries like finance,
    government and manufacturing where both security and scalability must be attained.
    Information management is another excellent application of blockchain technology
    and one such system is MedBlock, it uses distributed ledger technology to enable
    efficient EMRs access and EMRs retrieval. It uses an improved consensus mechanism
    to achieve consensus of EMRs with considerably lesser energy consumption and network
    congestion.

    support systems. The clinical trial systems involve a complicated sequence of
    data sharing between the sponsors, researchers, patients and regulators. Medrec
    is working on medical data management on the blockchain. It gives patient access
    to their transparent medical records. The data is secure and private, and it is
    only accessible by the patients who possess a private key. The data is mined by
    investigators and data providers are incentivized for contributing to the trials.
    Embleema is a consortium of medical researchers and patients that aims to provide
    better data to the researchers while paying participants. There is an app where
    a patient can upload their personal data such as medical, genomic, and lifestyle
    data. By having these records patient data does not need to be reconstructed for
    every clinical study they participate in. This saves money for the researchers
    as well as providing them better quality data.

    inertia to shift from the current mode of operations with a point to point interactions
    and limited information sharing. Several industry players are implementing solutions
    on blockchain and unlike the other technologies, regulators have come up to speed
    with the technology owing to its inherent principles of network integrity, security,
    privacy and inclusion which helps in larger adoption.

- en: BLOCKCHAIN ADOPTION CHALLENGES
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The industry is currently slow to adopt the widespread advances in blockchain
    technology. There are several main reasons because of which the adoption process
    is slow. The first reason is the lack of regulations. While there are certain
    incentives in place to adopt better technology, the differing regulations between
    various bodies makes it hard to adopt. Regulatory agencies like HIPAA and GDPR,
    want to ensure safety of patient records. However, the lack of international standards
    makes large scale solutions difficult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason is the network effect. This means that until widespread adoption
    is achieved, the solution is not effective. Blockchain gets stronger with every
    added organization; and adding those first ones are the most difficult. After
    a critical mass is reached, adoption will be much quicker and subsequent benefits
    will be more easily realizable. Moreover, there are no widely agreed upon standards
    in the blockchain industry. There are different blockchain networks out there,
    each offering has different benefits, but until there is a standard, it is hard
    for the industry to adopt. The various types of blockchain networks are not compatible
    so if one of your partners have one blockchain system, and another partner has
    a different system, it is hard to choose which one to adopt. Moreover, it is also
    important to account for evolving healthcare regulations, rules and standards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason for widespread adoption of blockchain technology being slow is
    that it is hard to forecast an accurate Return-On-Investment (ROI). This is predominantly
    due to the lack of large-scale real-life implementation in healthcare related
    use cases. Most pilot projects and prototypes are in early stages and have not
    been deployed to real life applications and hence their impact is not fully realized.
    While there have been reasons for slow adoption, companies and researchers continue
    to explore various ways for implementation of blockchain technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fourth reason is the initial investment cost that is often the prime hurdle
    in evaluating blockchain use cases. While there may not be a direct return on
    investment immediately, the benefits of having a blockchain based system will
    be eventually realized. The return on investment should be clear for each party
    involved, not just the individual company because unless other stakeholders are
    convinced, implementation of the blockchain system will be a challenge. Hence,
    it is imperative that the stakeholders thoroughly understand the need for blockchain
    based systems, even if it involves a complete overhaul of existing legacy systems.

- en: Mining in blockchain is expensive and uses a lot of computing power. While it
    is lucrative now with the high price of bitcoin, it is not the case in the healthcare
    industry. Mining should be done securely, while carefully accounting for resource
    intensity because it could end up costing the miners more money in computing resource
    consumption than the return that they receive. Some companies tend to incentivize
    miners by giving them access to anonymized data in return for their mining contributions
    (Azaria et al., 2016).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another aspect to take into consideration when evaluating a blockchain system
    in the healthcare industry is government regulations. The healthcare and life
    sciences industries are highly regulated, and for a product or service to be successful
    in the space it should comply with all rules and regulations. For instance, all
    the new regulations within HIPAA or GDPR. If a company in the US does not comply
    with HIPAA or a company in Europe does not comply with GDPR regulations, then
    the company and its products are generally not allowed for commercial use. It
    is important not just to consider the current rules and regulations, but to consider
    the future scenarios as well.

    industry, can be solved with the help of blockchain technology. As a trust mediator,
    it can enable novel healthcare solutions; and as an incentive machine, it can
    enable novel business models that may lead to new dynamics among various healthcare
    stakeholders like patients and providers. Similarly, blockchain based decentralized
    network and services may help to make medical data safe, secure, provide data
    integrity and data transparency among the stakeholders.

    and storage, use of blockchain in the pharmaceutical industry, drugs discovery,
    clinical trials etc. are explored. Examples of organizations and research institutions
    researching and developing blockchain-based applications for healthcare are also
    presented. However, despite the immense potential of blockchain technology and
    an enormous amount of interest around it, the technology still appears to be in
    a very early stage in terms of realization, implementation and application in
    the healthcare industry. Most blockchain based solutions are still in the research
    and experimenting stage.

    and running costs, lack of flexibility and interoperability with legacy systems,
    technological and adoption barrier, regulatory compliance and scaling still need
    to be adequately addressed to achieve the widespread implementation of blockchain
    technology in the healthcare and other related sectors.

- en: Following the globalization initiated by containerization of logistics, supply
    chains might be due another revolution by the integration of the disruptive blockchain
    technology that addresses the current issues with the management of complex global
    supply chains. Blockchains are distributed digital ledgers that require no central
    authority to operate while offering a tamper-proof and transparent history of
    each transaction from the very beginning. Distributed nature of these ledgers
    ensure that every participant of the supply chain has access to trusted data.
    The industry has already begun experimenting with blockchain integration into
    their operations. For the majority of the organizations, however, these experiments
    stay in proof-of-concept stages or small pilot studies. In this chapter, the authors
    discuss the supply chain characteristics that make blockchain integration favorable,
    lay the groundwork for how blockchain can be used for supply chain operations
    and how it has been used so far.

- en: Supply chains are networks of independent organizations that create and deliver
    a product to a customer. These complex provenance networks often span multiple
    countries or even continents. Due to the sheer number of actors on a supply chain,
    organizations concern themselves only with their immediate links; the upstream
    actor they are buying from and the downstream actor they are selling to. Incidentally,
    no one organization has overall control of the whole network, but organizations
    have to manage their resources and capital to fulfill their niche on the supply
    chain.

    and capital of the organizations on the chain. There is a delicate balance between
    centralization that leads to efficient use of time and resources, and decentralization
    to deter opportunistic behavior and fraud (Azzi et al., 2019; Schmidt & Wagner,
    2019). As mentioned above, supply chains are not centralized, so it is not feasible
    to think that organizations have adequate information about the provenance of
    their inputs below or they are liable to provide information to the parties above
    them. The lack of information causes wasted inventory space, uncertain delivery
    times and forces companies to plan with margins of errors that can lead to the
    bullwhip effect (Ivanov et al., 2018).

    Bitcoin in 2008 (Nakamoto, 2008). Since then it has found many uses in other than
    the finance domain. The primary benefits of blockchain technology in the supply
    chain management context include: transparency, traceability and decentralization.
    Blockchain can be used as a tamper-proof, immutable ledger shared between all
    parties. Once adopted by the organizations on the supply chain, transactions between
    the participants can be committed to the blockchain with some consensus process
    verifying the legitimacy of the data. The transparency and traceability of the
    information go hand-in-hand with a permission system such that the owner of the
    data can allow access only to concerned parties. All parties along the chain including
    the customers at the end can verify the provenance of the product they get and
    confirm that it is not counterfeit, sourced with unethical or questionable labor
    practices or contaminated in some way.'

    & Ersoy, 2018) and targeted applications such as a counterfeit-proof electronics
    supply chain (Xu et al., 2019). Internet of Things (IoT) is another field that
    can highly benefit from the digitization and interoperability that blockchain
    technology provides. IoT encompasses devices that have network access, collect
    data and act autonomously. With the developments in big data and machine learning
    fields, there is apparent value in collecting data to optimize operations and

    to an end customer. A typical view of a supply chain, also depicted in Figure
    1, starts with the natural resources that suppliers provide for manufacturers,
    which are then built into components and finally into products for the consumer
    market, with distributors handling the flow throughout the network.

    their suppliers, customers and logistics handlers, creating a material, component,
    information and capital flow in this network. It is important for the network
    to allow bidirectional flow to get feedback and handle refunds from the customers
    at each level and ultimately from the end user.

    after shipping costs became negligible in terms of distance, causing production
    to be done on the cheapest lot with the cheapest labor instead of near resources
    or transport hubs (Levinson, 2008). Since procurement is done on a global scale,
    competition occurs on the global stage as well.

    and the World Economy Bigger (Levinson, 2008), the author argues that the widespread
    adoption of the shipping container inadvertently caused the shipping costs to
    be negligible and kickstarted the modern global supply chains. This should not
    be mistaken with the invention of the shipping containers. Previous attempts to
    adopt containerization failed because the implementation was tried on just parts
    of the supply chain. For instance, the ship owners only implemented up to what
    made sense for their equipment. As a result, the next organization, down the line,
    had to deal with the non-standard logistics decisions of their supplier. Packing
    already packaged goods to yet another package and unpacking them at destination
    to sort through them caused the businesses to avoid containers. Yet, the benefits
    of the containers became apparent as the network effect led the whole supply network
    to support shipping containers; from the design of the ships to the docks and
    the packaging of the products. In short, the true potential of containerization
    was only realized when the “old ways” of the logistics side of the business were
    abandoned.'

    to what shipping containers did previously? Blockchain brings cryptocurrency connotations
    alongside, which is led by the success story that is Bitcoin, but also malicious
    actors or frauds such as Onecoin (Department of Justice, 2019). The story of how
    a company achieved a 289 percent increase in their share price only for it to
    crash back down in the same day, just by adding Blockchain to their name (Shapira
    & Leinz, 2017), which is indicative of the hype surrounding the technology. Another
    alternative to consider is this phase where businesses have not figured out how
    to utilize the potential of blockchain, similar to how businesses in the 1950's,
    who did not understand containerization, thought shipping containers were unnecessary
    or tried to keep the status quo for their own interests.

    similar phases; hype, rapid adoption causing a bubble, then the crash and then
    stabilization. Following the dot-com bubble, the Internet is now the familiar
    way of doing business. Blockchain may go through similar phases and find a stable
    niche to fill once its benefits and drawbacks get properly figured out. Surveys
    conducted on adopters of blockchain from industry (e.g. Pawczuk et al., 2020)

    international stage in mind where laws and ideologies differ across the borders
    during the journey of a product (Liu & Li, 2020). Any inefficiency during planning
    the operations results in non-optimal use of inventory and production facilities
    (Liotine & Ginocchio, 2020). This is directly tied to how operations of an organization
    are separated across the globe (Zhang, 2019). Furthermore, industry experts point
    to procurement and inventory costs as the main culprits to optimize using data
    driven long term planning (Kaçan, 2019). Supply chains with tiers of manufacturers,
    retailers and logistics entities are striving to create value for their organization.
    The paper-and-pen record keeping and the trail of hardcopy documents including
    invoices, certificates and bills of lading causes an environment where information
    is transient. Besides, the scarcity of information allows malicious actors to
    tamper with the documents through forgery or “double-spending” and robbery of
    container contents (Kshetri, 2018). The lack of comprehensive information has
    indirect consequences as well.

    to exploit the other party if there is an asymmetry between what two parties know
    of each other’s resources (Boles et al., 2000). This phenomenon has been tested
    under laboratory conditions within supply chain negotiations as well (Inderfurth
    et al., 2013). In that study, the authors explain that if one party withholds
    information and acts upon it within their full capacity, the exploiting party
    receives benefit with the expense of the rest of the supply chain including higher
    retail prices for the end customer. In order to disclose information, the suggested
    method is using screening contracts. However, these contracts are set up manually,
    which hinders the efficiency of the supply chain, especially considering the tendency
    to operate under Just-in-Time (JiT) approach. Furthermore, the authors have found
    through experiments that communication and mutual trust increases the supply chain
    performance, yet this trust is fragile. The root cause of the issue still lies
    in the cumbersome nature of doing business with paper-based document trails, which
    makes information sharing harder than information withholding.

    information flow dictates entities’ behavior. Babich & Hilary (2020) argue that
    retailers and suppliers on a supply chain would like to drive the price to their
    benefit by providing skewed information. For instance, suppliers forecast lower
    production to decrease the apparent supply, driving the price up. Retailers, on
    the other hand, present artificially inflated demands by forecasting higher sales
    to get the suppliers to increase their stock, driving the supply up and the prices
    down. Ultimately, both parties are exploiting the lack of widespread information.

    to information between parties. This effect dictates that when the variance of
    the presented demand to the manufacturers is higher than the variance of the production
    capacity of said manufacturer, they cannot make optimal decisions. The effect
    causes inventory mismanagement, reduced quality in customer service and inefficient
    distribution of production facilities (Schmidt & Wagner, 2019).

    for the transactions and enables anyone to enter the system without time constraints
    or approval from a centralized authority. PoW is the process of finding a nonce
    value such that the list of transactions in the block combined with the nonce
    value yields a hash value within requirements. Since computing the hash value
    is computationally expensive, participants in the blockchain (called miners) have
    to expend CPU power and electricity to participate.

    value system that is not backed up with a physical good. Previous “e-cash” systems
    failed because they relied on trusted central intermediaries. On the other hand,
    bitcoin is inherently tamper-proof because attackers are incentivized to contribute
    their resources to the value of the currency of the chain. If a malicious actor
    instead decides to spend resources to attack the currency, they would have to
    bolster more computation power than 51% of the participants to the network and
    even if they are successful, the currency loses value because of their efforts,
    rendering the gains worthless.

    classifications. Bitcoin is a fully public, open and permissionless network where
    participants can join the chain at any time. Private blockchains require authentication
    and authorization before participation in the form of network access or encryption.
    Consortium blockchain networks are extended private blockchains. They house validator
    nodes that govern which participant nodes can present consensus for transactions
    (Puthal et al., 2018). They are often built by organizations with a common goal
    but potentially competing interests, which is similar to how supply chains operate.

    with no access requirements, the costly PoW has to be in place against 51% of
    attacks. The blockchain implementations for the supply chain operations have been
    drafted up to use permissioned or consortium structures, where the costly PoW
    is not required (Yiannas, 2018).

    product's journey through a supply network is available and can be accessed in
    a quick manner. Differentiation between perishable products such as food or pharmaceuticals
    or electronic components is not necessary. It is intuitive to think that electronics
    are put together from many components procured from different manufacturers but
    an ingredient for an item sitting on a grocery shelf was probably distributed
    for use in thousands of products at one point in the supply network (Yiannas,
    2018). The traceability process should not only be possible, but be quick as well.
    In the blockchain integration pilot study by Walmart, a packet of mangoes was
    traced to the source farm with the traditional paper-based record keeping system
    in about a week (Yiannas, 2018). During a crisis related to food contamination,
    a week’s traceability period may not be acceptable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, traceability allows a company to isolate contaminated batches should
    any occur or avoid unnecessary blame while the products that are traced to safe
    origins do not need to be wasted. Traceability is a valuable target to optimize
    when a company wants to present their ethical means of sourcing or sustainable
    business practices. In a holistic view, organizations that raise their traceability
    standards increase ethical compliance, reduce the cases of missing products during
    shipments and fraudulent products for the whole supply network (Chang et al.,
    2019). In electronics manufacturing, traceability helps with authenticity (Xu
    et al., 2019). Blockchain helps traceability as follows; every product or document
    is created alongside its digital twin. Real life transactions where products or
    documents change hands between the participants of the supply chain also create
    a transaction on the blockchain where the digital twin is exchanged and committed
    irreversibly to the ledger, which is shared between every entity in the network.
    The final recipient of the real life good can trace the digital token from creation
    to destination (Francisco & Swanson, 2018). The link between the token and the
    physical good is preserved using serial numbers, bar codes, sensors or RFID chips
    (Schmidt & Wagner, 2019).

    subtly different from traceability since transparency deals with what the product
    consists of not where the product comes from. An edible product with good transparency
    translates to readily accessible allergen information for people with health complications
    or a trusted ingredient list that people with dietary preferences can rely on.
    Organizations with halal, kosher or organic product profiles can benefit from
    increasing their transparency – by way of gaining consumers’ trust (Chang et al.,
    2019). Transparency is an open problem for supply chains because of too many stakeholders
    along the chains. For instance, in 2018, over 3.5 billion dollars were lost due
    to failure to disclose allergen information in food items (Maberry, 2018). Implementing
    blockchain technologies enables meeting transparency requirements by tracing the
    ingredients of a product through the chronologically sorted list of transactions.

    by securing the trust to the blockchain’s state. Additional security measures

    JiT operations have been getting traction to optimize inventory and production
    facility utilization. Real time tracking through IoT sensors can lead to ahead-of-time
    operations with the ability to track even the minute details and small batches
    (Kshetri, 2018). Finally, dispute resolution between buyers and the sellers get

    and machine learning. IoT data, product journey, sensor readings such as temperature
    and humidity and even video data should be readily available for this purpose
    (Liu & Li, 2020). Digitization of transaction documents or elimination of paper
    trails is tied to the efficiency of transactions. For instance, logistics company
    Maersk has found that their shipments would wait unnecessarily in ports due to
    missing paperwork which would have been tied to the digital twin of the shipment

    and trust across the supply network by ensuring that each participant has access
    to the shared and trusted state. The democratic consensus process confirms this
    further. The transparency aspect of blockchain integration stems from decentralization
    as well; the ledger is distributed to all parties. Current supply chain transactions
    establish validation by assigning the arbitration of trust to a third party verifier,
    driving up the cost of a transaction (Zhang, 2019). After widespread blockchain
    adoption, these verifiers will be shifted towards the entry points of the supply
    chain to assure correct human or sensor input to the blockchain. The rest of the
    transactions along the supply chain are between blockchain participants, and verification
    of those transactions are handled through the consensus mechanisms (Babich & Hilary,
    2020).

    protection from attacks against accessibility (Min, 2019). Traditional database
    management systems need to have protection against these threats while ledgers
    run on blockchain technology are intrinsically secure. Additionally, through the
    choice of appropriate consensus algorithms and validator nodes, the blockchain
    can be secured in the presence of untrusted nodes (Toyoda et al., 2017). It should
    be noted that untrusted does not necessarily equate to malicious. Competing participants
    with potentially diverging interests (Babich & Hilary, 2020) also calls for security
    measures. Finally, blockchain integration is used for secure document exchange
    and storage with cryptographic security and is used for “identity validation for
    assets and individuals” (Kshetri, 2018).

    traditional database management systems. These systems are tailored to the organizations
    and are effectively walled gardens in terms of data access from third parties.
    Interoperability in this context refers to systems readily accepting each other's
    communications and data. Standardized blockchain transactions or API requirements
    are part of interoperability as well. Interoperability is not necessarily a direct
    benefit of blockchain integration but an important milestone when gradual adoption
    of blockchain integration of organizations happens. Blockchain integration after
    reaching the interoperability milestones allows for the digitization of the supply
    chain and the opportunity to use Internet of things (IoT) devices and sensors
    for enhancing the quality requirements tracking. The temperature, pressure or
    other variables of the products shipment can be tracked in real time and through
    smart contracts, committed to the blockchain automatically. GPS trackers and the
    chronological ordering of blocks allows for real time tracking and pinpointing

    2017). The resulting token is a record of proof for the whole or parts of the
    digitized asset. The owner of a block therefore owns the whole physical good (i.e.

    The authors suggest that blockchain integration can help IoT communications by
    providing data reliability. Furthermore, blockchain can provide unique identifiers
    for each device on the network and a trusted authentication scheme. They have
    identified three communication architectures for use in blockchain integration.
    The first one is IoT-IoT where IoT devices communicate directly with each other
    for low latency applications while blockchain only provides the addressing and
    authentication framework. The second architecture is IoT-Blockchain, where IoT
    devices have to use blockchain as a database to query and act autonomously. The
    transactions are immutably committed to the blockchain for this architecture.
    The third architecture is the Hybrid approach in which the previous two architectures
    are combined, where appropriate, to create a full operation definition. The authors
    claim that the hybrid approach is the best way to integrate IoT to blockchain
    applications since it leverages the real-time capabilities of IoT with the aforementioned
    benefits of the blockchain.

    solve the issue. This finding is supported by Queiroz et al. (2019) as well, who
    identified IoT devices to be especially useful for ensuring that the initial input
    from the environment to blockchain is legitimate. These sensors may include temperature
    and weight sensors, barcodes and RFID tags. For perishable materials such as pharmaceuticals
    and food items, gel-like trackers that do not disrupt the items can be used. Literature
    has also suggested successful PoW techniques that identify fraudulent food items
    without opening their containers (Ha, Leng et al., 2020). Value of these proposals
    are apparent when considering the statement by a wine authenticator “The value
    of fraudulent fine wine in circulation may be as much as $1 billion” (Adam Lechmere,
    2016). The diversity of these methods underlines the interoperability requirements
    of blockchain implementations as well as the redundancy that could be established

    It is well justified by retailers, manufacturers and consumers. Retailers would
    like to pinpoint the provenance of items in case of contamination or similar issues
    that would lead to a recall process for the product. Manufacturers would like
    to avoid misplaced blame when their product is not the cause of an outbreak so
    that they do not have to issue recalls or lose reputation tied to their brand
    in the face of the public. Finally, customers would like to purchase food items
    that are held up to standards (Tan et al., 2018). Pai et al. (2018) have reported
    that “a typical beverage recall would have cost 8 million dollars in 2017 and
    456 food recalls in the United States is estimated to cost 3.5 billion dollars”.
    For the majority of the recalls, the culprit is undeclared allergen information
    (Maberry, 2018). In other words, the food industry lost upwards of 3.5 billion
    dollars due to lack of transparency and traceability. It is no wonder that the
    initial surge of blockchain adoption in supply chains targeted the food industry.

    such as dilution or faking, is detrimental to consumer health, disastrous consequences
    stem from outbreaks that use contaminated foodstuff as disease vectors. One particular
    case of E. coli outbreak during 2006 is of interest since the offending batch
    of spinach that hospitalized 102 people and caused the death of 3 has found to

    The case of luxury goods draws a contrary case from the previous case studies
    since foodstuffs are relatively low-value items that require atomistic risk evaluation
    where the journey of a product from the farm to the plate of a customer can be
    planned in steps. High-value items that Everledger deal with require holistic
    solutions due to the increased threat to the high-value items (Kshetri, 2018).
    For instance, to overcome the state zero problems, Everledger’s operations include
    “scan and verify every diamond manually before its data is stored on the blockchain”,
    which the company has done for over 2 million diamonds, as reported in a 2019

    diamonds are tied to certifications and regulations; hence Everledger assigned
    Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group to certify traceability, truthfulness, thoughtfulness
    and transparency; and independent diamond grading authority, Gemological Institute
    of America (GIA), to certify the physical attributes of each diamond as verifiers
    (George, 2020a). Similar to how Walmart presented its product's traceability and

    requires altering every block, while the rest of the network is following the

    or more systems. When interoperability between systems is high, then they can
    communicate, share data, and use each other’s functionalities. When the interoperability

    open blockchain networks. It requires the participants to increment a nonce value
    to calculate a hash using the list of waiting transactions. The resulting hash
    value should be lower than a set limit. This busywork is in place mainly to select
    the transactions to commit to blockchain while protecting the network from malicious
    actors, as adversaries cannot bolster enough computational power to divert the
    blockchain.'
