- en: The advent of internet give rise to technological advance world and Internet
    of things is the new buzz terminology which is used for machine to machine connectivity.
    The internet of things is shaping almost all business sectors and retailing is
    one of them making retailing smarter beyond our imagination. Internet of things
    is a combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning making the collected
    data useful for the marketers. One best example of IoT is at your home fridge
    reminding you about milk requirement and controlling your air conditioner while
    sitting at office. Internet of things will prove disruptive to the retail industry
    (Gregory, 2015). Internet of things has a strong impact on retailing and retailers
    are now focusing on providing better in store shopping experience for the customers
    making it much more unique, efficient and of course profitable as IoT offers the
    ability to interact with both devices and people which further provides information
    on brand performance, present and potential customers, customer engagement, introducing
    new product, store layout optimization. Companies like American Apparel, Kroger,
    Tesco, Wal-Mart has been using robotics, RFID tags for enhanced customer service
    and brand experience. Digital technologies have opened the doors of availability
    of diverse and rich information for the customers and the way it can be accessed
    on multiple devices. The prevailing competition has given customers a lot of choice
    to choose from. Digital transformation provides various tools to analyze these
    vast choices like business analytics and other predictive tools which helps retailers
    to understand customers and framing marketing strategies accordingly. Every customer
    is different and wants to access the information in their own way as consumers
    are more aware about all the possibilities, thus digital retailing provides different
    channels to choose from like physical store, online store, social media platform
    and mobile communications as well. IoT assists customers and salesperson to locate
    goods where stores are equipped with sensors which lowers down the requirement
    of sales staff as the details can be provided on digital display. IoT proved very
    helpful in delivering the right product at right time ensuring maintained condition
    from shipment to arrival. It also aids in saving energy and costs, helps businesses
    to save money as the technology enabled devices can automatically keeps check
    on wastage. IoT in retail has witnessed strong shift in consumption, shopping
    behavior. According to Capgemini, 2020 report, 69% percent of consumers overall
    – and more than 80% of consumers in China and India – prefer to shop with retailers
    who are using automation and believe that automation can be the solution for the
    problems experienced while shopping in store.

    advancements. As it is not about only selling products, but providing exclusive
    purchase journey by providing interactive and engaging customer experience (G.J.
    ten Bok, 2016). Internet of things is one of the innovate things been adopted
    by retail sector also considered a way of achieving competitive advantage (G.J.
    ten Bok, 2016). Auto-ID Labs originated the tem internet of things while working
    on networked RFID infrastructure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    (Wortmann and Flüchter, 2015). Omnichannel experience in retail is being provided
    by various ways like RFID tags, sensors, virtual reality, Wi-Fi (Iotuk.org.uk,
    2017). IoT has been used for linking actual and virtual world together providing
    24x7connectivity. It has also used by the retailers for identifying right customer
    at right time (Vermesan et al., 2009). Retailers are identifying needs of customers
    thus improving sales (Maltseva, 2018). Enhance customer loyalty can be achieved
    by introducing new and innovative techniques that provide better shopping experience
    (Mckinsey.com, 2016). The importance of providing customer a unique experience
    by using AI and IoT techniques is of utmost value as it drives the sales (Mohapatra
    and V. Krishnan, 2018). E-shopping carts or smart carts which leads to enhance
    user experience and drive numbers (Pavaluru, 2017). The study by Atos, investigated
    about the future of retailing and the impact of technology on current retail outlets.
    IoT in order to penetrate technology will provide unique opportunities for developing
    innovative business models to increase the market share and capturing more market
    (Narasimha, Vijaya. 2015). According to McKinsey report on IoT, retail environments
    are being considered as physical spaces to purchase different offerings (product
    or service) by the marketers including traditional retail outlets and showrooms
    like bank branches, sports complexes etc. Customers are now expecting a better
    shopping experience with application of advance technology due to advent of internet
    and technological advancements in the sector. Internet of things has been considered
    as new wave of e-commerce in the world of retailing for providing unique shopping
    journey every time.

    now a-days and with the help of IoT technology the data can be leveraged from
    installed cameras, mobile devices, videos and social media platforms. The data
    on consumer purchase behavior collected from these sources can easily be converted
    into valuable information about present and future plans of purchasing. Making
    cordial relation with the customers is essence of retailing and adding component
    ‘smart’ makes it even more crucial (Manyika et al., 2015). Salesperson can adjust
    their shopping experience accordingly on the basis of past purchase information
    of customers by using face recognition software. Smart CRM also allows salesperson
    to understand customers’ nature and personality by going through his personal

    because of long queues at the counter even some customers may leave without purchasing
    anything due to this botheration. Automated point of sale or accepting payment
    through mobile phones can be the solution and with this conversion rate can also
    be increased. It automatically scans items present in the shopping cart being
    linked with customer bank, charges total amount to customer paying account through
    their mobile phones. System read all RFID tags and transfers this information
    to wireless paying system at the time customer existing store. Automated checkouts
    makes customer more satisfied as it saves a lot of time and costs too for enterprises.
    Using automated checkouts companies can save staff costs as it reduces cashier
    requirement by 75% (Manyika et al., 2015). MagicBand, by Disney is an example
    of such technology in use which allows customer to have automated access of their
    rooms, card free payments and it is also provides useful information by tracking
    customer activities for providing better services (ComQi, 2015).'

    an increase of 5% in productivity (Manyika, et al., 2015). By using IoT one can
    also measure consumers’ interest regarding certain products present on the shelves
    (Parada et al., 2015). RFID is capable of providing a digital identity to all
    products across categories measuring reading time. With the help of LDR sensors
    placed behind the products allows managers to know about pick up status of product
    by flashing light on sensor. Managers can process this information in form of
    inventory management. For efficient customer visit store layouts can be tweaked.

    from past decades. By using IoT retailers can extract detailed data which can
    be used in reliable ways for large businesses. When it comes to IoT environment
    it is the sensors and devices which provide information about previously unconnected
    processes (Howe, 2014). Abundant information is available in retail about transactions,
    pricing, browsing history, time spend and sales behavior. Moreover, one can predict
    market trends by looking at social media (ComQi, 2015). Generally people follow
    other people reference to follow trend (Manyika et al., 2011). Retailers can combine
    relevant information with the help of Internet of Things in order to predict demand,
    they can also adjust current inventory and prices on basis of hourly demand with
    real-time analytics, (Pittman, 2013). Tracking customer activity via IoT generates
    massive data which can be utilized for specific segmentation (personalization)
    allowing retailers to move from traditional to modern outlook. Tracking individual
    customer behavior allows retailers to go for micro-segmentation where retailers
    easily identify customer’s need and do customization for which customers are ready
    to pay a little extra for the same (Wolfgang et al., 2016).

    in the areas of supply chain, better customer experience and value streams. Though,
    IoT seems friction but it is becoming reality and provides platform to retailers
    in order to build an improved ecosystem that connects physical and digital world.
    Tracking customers’ movements through IoT (smart mirror, digital signage, smart
    shelves, contactless checkouts, robots for browsing desired product, IoT enabled
    in store promotions etc.) leverage retailers to utilize the copious amount of
    data to provide seamless experience to customers and improve store layout and
    framing strategies for merchandise placement. Companies are utilizing newer technologies
    like big data, cloud computing often called as ‘Industrial internet’ to achieve
    operational efficiency and fostering innovation. It is estimated that Internet
    of things and industrial internet together add more than $14 trillion to the global
    economy by 2030 (ComQi., 2015).To optimize complex supply chain technologies like
    data visualization help employees to track inventories across supply chain. Automated
    smart tags allow managers to adjust prices in real time to suit the requirements
    of demand and supply or any effect of promotional schemes. Retailers are creating
    new channels. Almost all homely products are becoming part of IoT ecosystem from
    household products to fitness products for e.g. Iris platform by Lowe’s designated
    as ‘smart home hub’ capable of communicating with any device utilizing networking
    technologies like Wi-Fi or Z-Wave allows replenishment of medicines, glossaries
    and toiletries. No doubt, that retailer has realized the importance of technological
    advancements in retailing world and they are also applying these technologies
    while offering any product or service. Internet of things is newer technology
    which is getting huge popularity now-a-days which provides customer a blended
    channel and unique experience of shopping. The things are being connected with
    the online platforms in order to provide seamless and unique shopping journey.
    The technological advancement not only making customers delightful but also providing
    ample opportunities to the retailers in terms of increased market share, revenue,
    brand image and customer retention and loyalty.

    in retail. Attitude of customers, retailer and employee is crucial for accepting
    any new technology especially in retail. Customers’ usage has been widely predicted
    by companies by applying Technology Acceptance Models but when it comes to employee’s
    acceptance it is still a matter of concern and needs attention. Security and privacy
    needs to be created for widespread adoption of IoT technology along with marketing
    and ethical perspectives (Tan, et al., 2010). There exists huge risk of tampering
    data being unattended most of the times. Password protection is required which
    is hard to realize owing to limited computing capabilities (Atzori, et al., 2010).
    A survey conducted by TRUSTe revealed that (78%) of Internet users disagreed that
    the benefits of smart devices outweighed the privacy concerns. This makes it evident
    that IoT acceptance depends on user’s privacy (Lee, et al., 2015). Another significant
    factor is trust that makes the environment of IoT more challenging. Being smart
    objects when they take decisions it becomes hindrance for trust between human
    and objects (Miorandi, et al., 2012). Growth of IoT technology impacts daily activities
    of retailers and become challenging for them to collaborate with such technology.
    The present situation requires not only to understand the technology but to accept
    the same for making value additions to their businesses. With the incredibly huge
    data generated by IoT, data management has become even more challenging task (Manyika
    et al., 2015). Knowing customers and selling products is not enough, working and
    collaborating with data is required. Undoubtedly need for different types of sales
    support is reduced owing to smart retailing but at the same time requirement for
    data analysts and designers for smart CRM system has been increased. Mckinsey
    estimated 1.5 million managers requirement that possess analytical skills for
    making effective business decisions.

    devices. Use of technology like artificial intelligence, internet of things, augmented
    reality is the need of the hour especially in the world of retailing where every
    customer is different and satisfying their enhanced expectations due to technological
    advancements has become even challenging for marketers. Internet of things has
    the ability to offer a large number of applications, of which a very little is
    available to our society (Atzori, Iera, Morabito, 2010). The power of data analytics
    and artificial intelligence can be utilized by the marketers for maintaining databases,
    analyzing information and targeting customers for better marketing efforts. Internet
    of things can be considered as ideal technological platform for making collaborations
    among organizations, suppliers, manufacturers and retailers. Leveraging IoT surely
    help companies in adapting and thriving especially in the period of uncertainty.
    It enables costs to drive down, adapting and responding to change, loyal customers.
    Retailers should choose such a platform that fosters them to grow and expand their
    IoT infrastructure in the market like Samsung ARTIK. Moreover, IoT technology
    help retailers in predicting the market return (ComQi, 2015). They need to embrace
    this new technology in order to have exciting and fruitful opportunities and beating
    the competition. This paper explores the importance of internet of things in retailing
    and organizations using this technology for smart retailing. Further research
    can be done to access the impact of IoT in area like infrastructure management,
    IT and financial management etc. this study used secondary data further research
    can be done analyzing customer experience and satisfaction in IoT enabled stores
    by collecting primary data.
