    two-chip sandwich costs two thousand chips, but all the chips are worth a thousand
    times as much. It’s still just two chips!”

    weighing the money instead. Now a sandwich is worth two pounds of million-dollar
    chips, which makes it a trillion-dollar sandwich. Same sandwich, but no pickle.”

    shop, where you meet with the chipchanger.

    and wearing a fedora. He buys your bitcoin—you transfer it to him like email—and
    he gives you poker chips at today’s market rate. This lets you buy groceries or
    pay taxes. Even if the government outlaws the chipchangers, citizens will just
    start trading bitcoin with each other. The citizens will work around a bad government.
    The government will find it is powerless to stop the flow of money out of its
    own leaky financial system.”
