    risk capital from sources such as personal funds, angel investors, venture capitalists,
    institutional investors, and equity markets. Loan capital, with interest payable
    at fixed or varying rates, and secured to some extent with collateral, can flow
    to entrepreneurs from multiple sources too. Convincing sources of risk capital
    to invest in or lend to an entrepreneur’s ventures is not always easy, and for
    investors with capital to deploy, finding and qualifying worthy recipients is
    challenging. At the heart of these difficulties is the matter of trust. Can investors
    trust entrepreneurs and borrowers to use their capital as agreed upon and to use
    it prudently? Will interest and principal repayment be fulfilled on the agreed
    upon terms? This trust gap brings about the need for intermediaries who can conduct
    due diligence on behalf of investors and lenders and bring such aggregated information
    to their clients for review and decision.

    lenders together with entrepreneurs and firms seeking capital. Beyond providing
    access to sources of capital (in some cases, helping raise risk capital and credit)
    and facilitating lending and repayment, financial intermediaries can offer several
    other ancillary and related services. These complementary services include banking
    and custody, payments processing, remittances, savings accounts, exchanges for
    trading and settling financial assets and derivatives, investment advice and management,
    international trade financing, letters of credit (LCs), and personal finance.
    Financial intermediaries also serve evolving needs such as requests for insurance
    products, estate planning, and financial advising.

    assume systemic risk. In essence, financial services incumbents offer a trusted
    means to reduce client risk in return for intermediary fees, which can amount
    to a significant portion of transaction amounts. Additional costs can include
    service fees, long lead times to finalize a transaction, limited transparency,
    a lack of user control over personal data, and unilaterally determined terms of

    such as meeting the need for trust, providing fast and cheap liquidity, furnishing
    accurate immutable timely data, establishing provenance and thus auditability,
    and ensuring high security. It can do all this while also significantly reducing
    intermediary fees though disintermediation and enabling direct interaction between
    counterparties. Blockchain makes possible decentralized P2P financial services
    and can lower the cost of developing, launching, and trading financial instruments.
    Not surprisingly, many emergent firms have used blockchain to offer financial
    services on a blockchain, emerging as competition for incumbents. Decentralized

    small investor access to a greater variety of financial assets. DeFi can also
    help issuers by incorporating asset life cycle events including automated interest
    and principal payments. Portfolio managers can benefit by accessing decentralized
    exchanges (DEXs) and new classes of investments with smart contract-enabled programmable
    features. And regulators can benefit from the immutable and transparent nature
    of blockchain transactions, with automated audit and examination of compliance,

    Ethereum have many advantages, but their volatility reduces their attractiveness
    as a store of value or means of exchange. Stablecoins are necessary for digital
    currencies to gain wide acceptance and to “cross the chasm” into mass market adoption.
    Stablecoins can be created by linking the stablecoin with fiat currency reserves
    on a one-to-one basis; stablecoins such as USDC (US Dollar Coin) or USDT (Tether)
    are created in this fashion, with USDC or Tether created in an amount equivalent
    to the total of US dollars held in reserves. An alternative approach is to use
    cryptocurrency reserves as the basis for issuing stablecoins, with continual algorithmic
    adjustment of the ratio of cryptocurrency reserves to stablecoins issued to adapt
    to the price volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency reserves. MakerDAO and
    its DAI stablecoin is one example of this approach.

    has been met with significant adoption. As cryptocurrencies have limited use as
    a means of exchange in commercial transactions (due to volatility and high transaction
    costs for small deal amounts), investment and speculation became the dominant
    motive for purchasing cryptocurrencies, with the hope that these currencies—Bitcoin,
    Ether—would appreciate, furnishing capital gains to their holders. Thus, Bitcoin
    and other digital currencies would be idle assets while awaiting appreciation.
    A December 2020 estimate suggested that “60 percent of all Bitcoin in the circulating
    supply has not moved in the last 12 months”[4](14085-0014.xhtml#en168).

    creating stablecoins to motivate cryptocurrency “hodlers” (HODL is a term in the
    cryptocurrency world for long-term holders of bitcoin and other digital currencies),
    to deploy their idle capital. Lending idle cryptocurrency creates liquidity and
    income for digital currency holders. The stablecoin model at Maker combines converting
    volatile cryptocurrency into stable digital currency, with a provision for lending
    the stablecoins created. This is analogous to banking and fractional reserve-based
    lending at commercial banks, in which banks hold reserves that are a fraction
    of total deposits on hand but can make loans that are many multiples of what is
    on hand because they are backed by a central authority such as the US Federal
    Reserve. This arrangement adds to the money supply.

    smart contract facility is a feature particularly useful in structuring financial
    applications. Maker and its DeFi competitors use ERC-20-compatible tokens, such
    as Ether. ERC-20 is the standard for how tokens are created within Ethereum, and
    it defines the necessary basic functions that all smart contracts and ERC-20-compatible
    tokens are expected to fulfill.[5](14085-0014.xhtml#en169) These include information
    about the total supply of a given token, an account owner’s balance, and the ability
    to transfer a specific number of tokens as directed to or from a specific customer
    address. These features permit a spender to withdraw or return a specified number
    of tokens from or to a specified address and activate an approval module to carry
    out an instruction, such as transferring or withdrawing digital currency. Maker
    includes additional functions specific to its stablecoin DAI, such as the ability
    to mint and burn (cancel) tokens within Maker; this function applies to DAI as
    well to the separate MKR token used within Maker to give MKR owners a say in governance.

- en: To counteract cryptocurrency instability, Maker pegged and maintains its DAI
    to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. Each DAI created is backed by the Ethereum token,
    Ether, and is deposited with Maker. The stablecoin creation process begins when
    a customer deposits Ether with Maker and agrees to lock up the deposited ETHER
    in a vault. Once the Ether has been deposited and secured, Maker’s collateral
    rules kick in with an internally set collateral-to-DAI ratio, initially established
    at, say, 150 percent. The collateral ratio is set by Maker governance members
    and is partly dependent on the volatility of the cryptocurrency underlying the
    collateral; the more volatile collateral would bear a higher collateral ratio.
    As the value of Ether fluctuates, some degree of overcollateralization is necessary—Maker’s
    intent is to boost confidence in DAI through overcollateralization, increasing
    the safety of the DAI stablecoin. At a 150 percent collateral ratio, depositing
    1 Ether (worth, say, $300 on cryptocurrency exchanges at the time of deposit)
    would allow the creation of 200 DAI, which the depositor of Ether could borrow
    (the collateralized debt position).

    is similar to margin loans provided by stockbrokers. Margin loans allow an investor
    to avoid liquidating positions while still maintaining access to a portion of
    invested capital at a cost of the margin interest rate. When the borrower pays
    back the DAI, the Ether deposited in the vault can be retrieved, less a stability
    fee charge (akin to interest; the annual borrowing rate varies with the specific
    cryptocurrency deposited and the collateral ratio. When Ether was deposited at
    a 150 percent collateral ratio, the stability fee was around 3.5 percent in June
    2021).

    a variable interest rate in additional DAI, generated from the stability fee (the
    rate is determined by Maker governors). In effect, Maker offers a savings account
    for Ether, with interest paid in DAI. Total DAI supply grows in relation to the
    demand for collateralized lending. Smart contracts automate Maker transactions,
    including issuing DAI loans, managing loan repayment, collecting interest rates,
    liquidating bad loans, and managing vaults.

- en: DAI is tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges, and Maker relies on arbitrage and
    the link to deposited collateral to maintain the DAI-to-dollar parity. Raising
    or lowering the stability fee results in reduced debt or increased borrowing,
    changing the demand for and supply of DAI. If DAI drops to $0.99, the debtor can
    purchase 200 DAI for $198 and repay the original 200 DAI debt, making a small
    gain. When the DAI is repaid, it is removed from circulation, reducing the total
    supply of DAI and raising its price, bringing it back into parity with the US
    dollar. If the DAI repaid were not canceled, the total amount of DAI would exceed
    the amount of collateral, causing DAI value to drop below the desired 1:1 parity
    with the dollar. This process is illustrated in figure 4.2.

    and 1.03 through July 2020\. However, Ether is volatile, as its value fluctuates.
    If Ether’s value falls to the point where it is worth less than $300, the borrower

    collateral requirement or return the borrowed DAI. As noted above, the borrower
    would have to pay the stability fee to retrieve the Ether. (The Ether values used
    above are for illustrative purposes. Ether’s price fluctuated between $1,416 and

    Off-chain DAI prices are collected from trusted oracle feeds chosen by MKR voters,
    and a median DAI price is fed on-chain via an Oracle Security Module to the Maker
    protocol (with a time delay for security protection if an oracle is compromised).
    To avoid having their loans being liquidated automatically for breaching collateral
    floors and being forced to pay a penalty fee, DAI borrowers are motivated to collateralize

    Any leftover collateral (typically due to overcollateralization and the automatic

    Maker token ownership allows participation in governance through voting, and voting
    rights are attached to Maker MKR tokens with one vote per MKR. MKR token holders,
    acting as a DAO, adjudicate issues such as debt ceilings for different types of
    collateral, the risk premium built into interest rates on borrowing, procedures
    for capping bad debts. They also ensure Maker system stability by balancing total
    Maker system collateral locked up with total system debt. MKR tokens can rise
    in value as Maker becomes more successful in establishing its DAI stablecoin,
    with more DAI issued, borrowed, and repaid. The rise in the value of MKR governance
    tokens would be similar to owning shares in a growing company. This creates incentives
    for users to manage the Maker protocol prudently and maintain DAI stability.

    exceeds a set ceiling, a surplus auction is held, with the excess DAI sold for
    MKR tokens, which are then burned, reducing the supply of MKR and raising its
    value. Burned tokens are sent to a wallet without a private key so that no one
    can access this wallet, and the DAI or MKR coins sent to this wallet are irretrievably
    lost. Conversely, if a collateral liquidation along with DAI in the Maker Buffer
    is insufficient to fully pay off a debt position, MKR is minted and sold for DAI
    to fully liquidate the debt, lowering the MKR token price as a result. (Note that
    MKR is not mined like Bitcoin and is instead created by the Maker governance body.

    the repo rate allows institutions to earn interest on temporary excess cash by
    lending it overnight to other institutions that need it to fund short-term liquidity
    needs. The Federal Open Markets Committee adjusts the Interest on Excess Reserves
    (IOER) rate to move the Fed funds rate to its desired target range. If the overnight
    interbank lending rate is greater than IOER, then banks will loan or expand credit
    and vice versa. Similarly, Maker can adjust the collateral level, the liquidation
    of undercollateralized debt, and the stability fee to influence the creation of
    DAI loans, subject to its self-imposed debt ceiling. It is important to note that
    this debt ceiling has been raised as the market and acceptance of DAI grows, thus

- en: Compound accepts a broad range of Ethereum assets (e.g., Ether, DAI, Tether),
    though not every Ethereum-compatible token asset is supported. Ethereum token
    owners can deposit their Ethereum-compatible token assets in Compound and lend
    them via the Compound protocol, earning interest on what would otherwise be an
    idle asset. The interest rate on borrowing is algorithmically determined and varies
    by asset, depending on the demand/supply interaction for that Ethereum asset;
    smart contracts match supply with demand and compute a continuously varying interest
    rate. The Compound protocol permits lenders to borrow from the pool of a specific
    asset (e.g., the Ether pool). Pools are created by combining the Ether deposited
    by all of Compound’s clients. Thus, lenders do not directly lend to borrowers;
    instead, the Compound protocol provides a loan from the pool of a specific asset
    to borrowers seeking to borrow that particular asset.

- en: By aggregating assets supplied by all the users, and lending from this pool,
    Compound increases liquidity for each lender. Lenders can also withdraw assets
    without waiting for a specific loan to mature. In doing so, Compound creates frictionless
    borrowing of Ethereum tokens, without P2P negotiation of debt maturity, the interest
    rate, or collateral. Borrowers must deposit their own Ethereum-compatible tokens
    on Compound as collateral, with the total amount they could borrow being a portion
    of the amount of collateral deposited. The value of each asset provided as collateral
    is determined by a price oracle, which pools prices for that asset from the top
    ten cryptocurrency exchanges. The amount that a borrower can borrow depends on
    the riskiness of the assets furnished as collateral. These assets vary in their
    collateral strength, varying from zero to one for riskier to less risky assets.
    The riskier the collateral, the smaller the amount that can be borrowed against
    that collateral. If a user exceeds their borrowing capacity because of a decline
    in the value of collateral, a portion of the borrowing is repaid with collateral
    discounted at a certain rate. This is also known as the liquidation discount,
    and it creates an incentive for arbitragers in the Compound community to step
    in and pay off portions of the debt with their assets of the same type, in turn
    taking ownership of the portion of the borrower’s collateral that would have been
    liquidated.

    parameters such as the interest rate algorithm for each type of asset and determining
    which Ethereum assets would be accepted on Compound for deposit and borrowing.
    To decentralize governance, Compound launched the COMP token, passing governance
    into the hands of COMP token owners. New COMP tokens were issued every day and
    divided proportionately across asset classes and then equally between borrowers
    and lenders in each asset class;[12](14085-0014.xhtml#en176) thus, every Compound
    user now has a voice in governance.

    use in the Ethereum ecosystem, borrowing Ether or other Ethereum assets using
    existing ownership assets as collateral (margin loans), and shorting a token to

    offer a Maximize COMP Mining feature[13](14085-0014.xhtml#en177) to aid users
    in achieving greater returns through “yield farming,” which helps Ethereum asset
    owners put their idle assets to work. In yield farming, digital currency owners—liquidity
    providers—lock up their assets in a liquidity pool, which uses smart contracts
    to lend from the pool. The liquidity providers who have contributed their assets
    to the pool earn transaction fees, interest on the loan, and, sometimes, governance
    tokens, which could appreciate the underlying entity; for example, Compound grows

    around $1.3 trillion in securities trades daily in 2019, and DTCC registries update
    trades to reflect changes in ownership and payment for the securities traded.
    To protect against counterpart risk of nonpayment, financial institutions set
    aside capital to cover the risks before actual settlement. In addition, they maintain
    their own records of delivery and settlement. Reconciling conflicting information
    consumes resources and takes time, and thus improving these back-office functions
    (which are often mainframe-based batch processes) could reduce settlement times
    and save on costs. Centralized exchanges such as Coinbase have emerged to facilitate
    digital asset trading and custody, and they improve on the drawbacks inherent
    in the DTCC system—slower settlement times, the need to set aside capital to cover
    nonpayment risk, and back-office reconciliation of counterparty transaction records.

    The twenty-four-month pilot, on a private, permissioned Ethereum protocol, was
    limited to the most actively traded and least volatile stocks, with a cap of 1

    of securities, and by creating a single unified record of the trade, reconciliation
    becomes unnecessary. Thus Paxos’s blockchain-based trading could facilitate delivery
    versus payment and same-day settlement and could even allow settlement multiple
    times a day, increasing intraday liquidity. This would free up capital currently
    devoted to protecting against counterparty risk. While the automated stock transfer
    would occur on the Paxos blockchain rather than inside the DTCC system, with cash
    held as a stablecoin in Paxos custody accounts, DTCC would still maintain the
    updated stock registry, insulating the trading system against glitches during
    the pilot trials. While initial participation was restricted to counterparties
    where both sides are part of the Paxos Settlement Service network, Paxos could
    seek SEC authorization to offer its blockchain solution to all broker-dealers
    in the United States to settle their securities transactions as trials proceed

    owners can easily change one cryptocurrency into another or into fiat currencies,
    earn interest on their holdings thorough lending or savings deposits, and leverage
    their holdings. Likewise, the rise of DeFi has led to a corollary rise in DEXs,
    among them Uniswap, Kyber, Balancer, Curve Finance, and Bakkt, all of which dispense
    with centralized market makers, like in Coinbase (as discussed in chapter 1),
    and instead offer different versions of fast and secure decentralized P2P trading.

    representations of fiat currencies and commodities, and of real assets such as
    equity securities, as shown by Paxos. Thus, any asset that can be securely and
    immutably represented digitally has the potential to be traded on DEXs, disrupting
    traditional centralized exchanges.

    of ERC20-compatible tokens while also creating “programmable liquidity.” Balancer
    offers liquidity pools featuring portfolios containing several different ERC20
    token assets with underlying tokens of different weights in each distinct portfolio.
    This means Balancer can provide access to ETF-type cryptocurrency portfolios.
    In a shared liquidity pool, the creator of that pool decides which tokens will
    be accepted in the pool, with a maximum of eight different tokens, and sets weights
    for each token within the portfolio. Once the tokens and their weights are chosen
    for that shared liquidity pool, they cannot be changed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Balancer user then reviews the different portfolios available and decides
    which portfolio they would like to invest in, choosing a portfolio where the weighted
    averages of the currencies in that specific portfolio match their investor preferences.
    To invest in that portfolio, users swap some of their cryptocurrency holdings
    with other users, on cryptocurrency exchanges, to generate specific amounts of
    each of the currency components in that portfolio, which they then contribute
    to Balancer to gain a share of the portfolio. Furthermore, once an investor is
    part of a liquidity pool, that investor can earn fees in exchange for providing
    liquidity and facilitating trading of cryptocurrencies in their pool. So instead
    of paying an ETF money manager, ETF investors in Balancer earn income by virtue
    of making an investment, independent of any other income generated by the portfolio
    such as interest or appreciation.

    specific cryptocurrency for another. Once a trader places a swap order, an algorithm
    executes this swap across some subset of the liquidity portfolios so that the
    portfolio composition weights are preserved even as the prices of the underlying
    tokens change. Different portfolios will offer different prices depending on their
    need to swap currencies to maintain the desired portfolio composition, perhaps
    lowering prices for tokens that they have an excess of and need to sell to bring
    the portfolio back into balance.
  prefs: []

    larger orders are likely to cause prices to vary more since the larger order will
    have a greater effect on a portfolio’s balance across the desired portfolio composition
    weights.[15](14085-0014.xhtml#en179) This price change, termed “slippage,” is
    broadcasted to traders at the time of placing an order so that they can set limits
    on how much slippage is acceptable for the order to be executed. Such traders
    pay swap fees as set by each portfolio, and the algorithm favors trades with portfolios
    that have lower swap fees (as a percentage of the trade amount), provided they
    have the specific tokens being sought by the user. Taken together, the portfolios
    earn swap fees for providing liquidity in specific currencies, while the algorithm
    drives portfolios to lower their swap fees, thus lowering trading costs across
    the Balancer system.

    in Balancer governance, with the amount of BAL tokens increasing with the portfolio’s
    size. As such, larger portfolios provide greater liquidity to the Balancer system
    and earn more BAL. This gives them a greater voice in governance, meaning an increased
    voice in deciding the level of swap fees, rulesetting to decide which ERC20 tokens
    will be accepted, setting the algorithm features that allocate a trade across
    different liquidity pools, and so on.

    private pools, with that owner announcing tokens accepted for the portfolio, setting
    portfolio composition weights and swap fee percentages, and having full control

    money managers who wish to offer cryptocurrency ETF services with transparency
    about portfolio composition and weights. Such private pools offer creative opportunities
    for new blockchain utilities that wish to create a market for their native tokens
    and increase their token liquidity. For example, new blockchain start-ups can
    launch bootstrapping liquidity pools[16](14085-0014.xhtml#en180) with a portfolio
    composed of their tokens and other well-established tokens, such as Bitcoin or
    DAI, and over time can diffuse ownership of their tokens. Thus, Algorand, discussed

    to trade on the expected performance of underlying assets without having to own
    the asset itself (e.g., stock call and put options). Synthetix, a blockchain start-up,
    created a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum that
    also functions as a trading platform for synthetic forms of fiat currencies (e.g.,
    DAI as a synthetic form of the US dollar), cryptocurrencies, and commodities.
    It offers decentralized derivatives trading, generating native tokens called SNX
    that are tied to the value of collateral deposited with the Synthetix protocol.
    In this case, the ERC20 tokens deposited are digital representations of various
    assets such as fiat currencies (US dollar, euro, etc.), cryptocurrencies, and
    commodities (gold, silver). These could be extended in the future to other real
    assets such as equities.
  prefs: []

    token, Synths, with a high collateralization ratio of 800 percent or greater.
    Thus eight hundred SNX could generate one hundred Synths, which can be exchanged
    for derivatives of fiat and cryptocurrencies and commodities. Price changes of
    the chosen asset and the derivative’s value are tracked by an oracle; in the case
    of cryptocurrencies, Synths can also be used to short them, thus tracking declines
    in the price of Ether, Bitcoin, and more.

    goes to SNX holders as a reward for staking collateral. SNX holders can also earn
    an additional reward from a weekly increase in the number of SNX at 1.25 percent
    a week through 2023\. Synths are the users’ debt and must be repaid for the SNX
    collateral to be unlocked. The user debt changes continuously as a proportion
    of an individual user’s debt to the total debt of the Synthetix system as a whole,
    with total debt value changing as the price of the underlying assets change. As
    Synthetix explains, “in this way, SNX stakers act as a pooled counterparty to
    all Synth exchanges; stakers take on the risk of the overall debt in the system.”[17](14085-0014.xhtml#en181)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    require a lower collateral ratio of 150 percent and allow users to generate Synths
    directly against Ether rather than first exchange them for SNX. The user debt
    is then denominated in Ether, and the user does not participate in the pooled
    debt aspect of the system nor do they receive fees or rewards (because they do
    not assume debt pool risks). Because risk hedging of a larger volume is possible,
    trader access to digital asset derivatives markets increases trading volume, which
    improves market efficiency. As blockchain firms gain experience with decentralized
    stablecoins, P2P lending, DEXs, and derivatives markets, the same principles and
    mechanisms can be used to develop decentralized marketplaces. Over time, the swarm
    of competing protocols delivering similar functionality will thin out, and a few
    robust and full-featured protocols could become dominant. This process is being
    hastened with the rise of industry-wide consortia such as R3/Corda and Ripple,

    of these standard protocols, increasing their utility and helping them become

    exchanges supervise IEOs, hosting the sale of the new tokens on the issuer’s behalf.
    Launching the sale of tokens on an exchange is akin to floating new offerings
    through a lead underwriter. The exchange selects which token sales to host and
    subsequently list on its exchange. Selection is determined by parameters such
    as the issuing company’s potential, the issue quality, and maintaining the exchange’s
    reputation as a place to trade quality tokens. Potential token buyers become members
    of the exchange to bid for tokens, with exchanges often requiring that buyers
    hold that exchange’s tokens and pay for the issuing company’s new tokens with

    Maya and Jim[31](14085-0014.xhtml#en195) are examples of AI deployment supporting
    customer satisfaction. The automation enabled by chatbots and smart contracts
    can lower costs, providing a structural cost advantage through automating key
    processes in a scale-dominated industry. Cumulative customer data can enable dynamic
    premium pricing, particularly at renewal points, and such cumulative data can
    serve as the basis of forensic analysis to deter, detect, and guard against fraud.
    In this context, tokens generated within the blockchain can be used to incentivize
    desired behaviors; at Lemonade, for example, policyholders can designate a favorite
    charity to receive donations resulting from funds remaining in the claim pool,
    which in essence rewards customers for lower loss ratios and claims to premium
    income. Table 4.1 summarizes some of the benefits of blockchain deployment in
    insurance applications.

    premium quotes, from customer servicing and claims processing to customer retention,
    and from improving insurance marketing to lowering costs and raising customers’
    perceptions of fairness.[32](14085-0014.xhtml#en196) Secure blockchain data can
    help verify customer identity at the initial customer acquisition stage and later
    during customer service interactions. Blockchain also ensures privacy and data
    protection while updating records with newly verified transactions such as premium
    payments or revised policy terms. Similar data linkages can help verify group
    benefits for specific groups as the package of benefits available under insurance
    can vary from group to group. Immutable validated data provide a permanent record
    and help build trust between the insurance company and its insured clients and
    can be used in reducing fraud and detecting tampering and counterfeiting.[33](14085-0014.xhtml#en197)

    and IoT marine hull insurance solution, allowing companies such as Maersk to manage
    insurance for over 350 containerships operating around the world. Each insured
    ship is registered on the blockchain, with an algorithm calculating premiums and
    policies made available to ship owners. Using IoT devices, each ship’s voyages
    and collateral data such as location, weather, and environmental risk conditions
    are recorded. Accumulated data is used in premium calculation at policy renewal
    and in claims assessment and disposition. An ancillary benefit is a complete immutable
    record of ship life cycle events, which is useful for regulators, owners, and
    potential buyers on a ship resale. Such data in standardized formats can be securely
    exchanged with reinsurers, transparently reconciling transactions, and with third
    parties, for claims subrogation, eliminating information silos.

    contract–based reinsurance (what is described as “frictionless risk transfer”)
    to protect against excess losses in property insurance, or the “catastrophe excess
    of loss” application. B3i brings together real-time information sharing, which
    enables the reconciliation of accounts between the insurance company and its reinsurers
    and allows for automatic payouts.[35](14085-0014.xhtml#en199) Insurance blockchains
    like B3i can also smooth out the regulatory processes, enhancing auditability
    for regulatory bodies that can use smart contracts to query secured data and evaluate
    it for compliance with regulatory standards. For example, Amica Insurance[36](14085-0014.xhtml#en200)
    was able to smooth its claims processing once claims adjusters could draw on the
    blockchain to get timely accurate claims data, such as policyholder information,
    cause of claim, policy coverage and terms, policy claims history, and other essential
    documents. The claims adjuster could record customer statements, access maps,
    and submit documents, photos, and claims assessment reports available to others
    involved in claims adjustment, all through secure and timestamped audit trails.

    for improving insurance business efficiency. IoT devices can automatically detect
    insurance-triggering events, such as car accidents, further triggering repairs,
    authentication of repairs, completion at approved facilities, and ultimately linking
    to claims processing and payments. If policyholders agree to opt in and permit
    deployment, Groupama Insurance, for example, places IoT smart sensors on insured
    cars to track location, speed, acceleration, and related variables, enabling it
    to offer and deploy AI-aided insurance. Its policyholders are offered a discount
    on premiums in return for using the IoT sensors. One benefit of using them is
    real-time communication of collisions; if deemed serious, emergency services can
    be dispatched immediately, possibly saving lives.

    reduced reckless driving. This is because the IoT devices facilitate the transmission
    of precise car movements, which can be analyzed with algorithms derived from big
    data collision records and, together with traditional claims inspector reports,
    can validate and speed up claims processing and settlement. The accumulating dynamic
    data complements historic actuarial tables in improved risk prediction and risk
    prevention.[37](14085-0014.xhtml#en201) It also enables concierge-style insurance:
    with knowledge of individual driver habits, Groupama can coach drivers and warn
    them about dangerous conditions, whether that is impending adverse weather or
    road hazards. This leads to improved customer experiences and reduced claims,
    driving higher policy renewal rates. This kind of IoT-based data-driven insurance
    must comply with privacy regulations, and as such, Groupama requires customer
    consent to collect data and promises its customers it will never share customer
    data with third parties.'

    blockchain protocols specific to insurance, such as the Etherisc pilot. This P2P
    flight insurance pilot, built with the Etherisc protocol, pays the insured for
    flight cancellations or delays. It works by a smart contract first issuing the
    insurance in response to a request initiated by a client; payment is authorized
    when oracles verify a flight delay. This automates both issuance and claim processing
    in a transparent decentralized fashion. Another interesting pilot of the Etherisc
    application is crop microinsurance to small paddy rice farmers in Sri Lanka[38](14085-0014.xhtml#en202)
    through a collaboration between Aon, Sanasa, and Oxfam. Oxfam coupled its deep
    experience working with farmer communities in emerging markets to Etherisc’s blockchain
    protocol and decentralized risk pool expertise. Aon brought its expertise in reinsurance
    and innovative policy design to the project, while Sanasa added its local insurance
    industry and cultural knowledge. Many farmers in Sri Lanka’s remote areas are
    unbanked, with limited incomes and liquidity; bureaucracy and banking infrastructure
    is physically and financially out of reach for this population too. The proof-of-concept
    goal is to use blockchain to lower costs and increase efficiency while facilitating
    a farmer’s access to affordable microinsurance with fair and transparent payout
    upon occurrence of extreme weather (which could cause crop losses).
  prefs: []

- en: The longer-term goal is to offer an open-source generic insurance framework
    underpinning the Decentralized Insurance Protocol from Etherisc, enabling an “ecosystem
    of product builders, risk pools, oracles, claim adjusters, distributors, and underwriters
    to create insurance applications on the Ethereum blockchain.” An example of this
    is Raincoat, a collaboration with HurricaneGuard in Puerto Rico to develop cost-effective
    insurance against storms. It uses public data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration to detect hurricane windspeeds within a certain radius of the insured’s
    area and deliver automatic payouts.[39](14085-0014.xhtml#en203)

    loss of access to digital wallets, from misplaced private keys to theft, and professional
    liability insurance for blockchain development teams and firms, with policies
    to guard against project completion issues. In summary, combining blockchain protocols
    with insurance offerings can lead to improved efficiency gains, lower costs, more
    transparency, real-time data sharing with business partners and regulators, better
    claims processing, and fraud reduction. With accurate accessible data improving
    risk assessment and risk pricing, new products such as parametric insurance and
    automated marketing and claims adjustment are on the horizon.

- en: DeFi on blockchains can be cheaper and more secure and can give users control
    over their financial operations and personal data. Blockchains can offer a secure
    and lower-cost environment in which to conduct financial asset transactions, provide
    record keeping and regulatory compliance, and engineer cryptocurrency/digital
    currency stability. These environments are ideal for organizing exchanges in which
    to trade digital assets as well as financial instruments that are linked to the
    performance of those digital assets (i.e., derivatives). Each major category of
    DeFi innovation has built on previous advances. In response, incumbents have launched
    blockchain pilots and projects of their own, one of the better-known examples
    being JPMorgan’s Quorum, a private version of Ethereum. The Quorum blockchain
    was a response to the challenge from emerging DeFi entrants. It aims to prevent
    the erosion of JPMorgan’s market position and to allow it to compete in the emerging
    DeFi world. Quorum has attracted over three hundred banks to its Interbank Information
    Network, which is integrated with the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

    address the confidentiality needs of enterprises by adding privacy features (e.g.,
    allowing for anonymity of both sender and recipient) as well as by offering users
    the ability to conceal the amounts or specifics of assets being traded.[40](14085-0014.xhtml#en204)
    JPMorgan planned to make such extensions available to third parties that could
    build vertical applications incorporating such privacy, such as Komgo’s energy
    trading application (Komgo is a group of companies using blockchain to improve
    trade commodity finance and related applications). To increase acceptance and
    uptake across enterprises, JPMorgan’s Quorum merged with Consensys to launch Consensys
    Quorum, to offer both public and private enterprise solutions as well as robust
    features attractive to enterprises while maintaining open-source development.[41](14085-0014.xhtml#en205)

    Hyperledger Fabric (from IBM) along with open-source protocols, such as Hyperledger
    Besu, are further examples of enterprise-friendly protocols. A 2019 report showed
    that Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, and Quorum accounted for 86 percent of all unique
    blockchain developers placing code on GitHub.[42](14085-0014.xhtml#en206) Over
    time, competing protocols will merge and a few surviving platforms will emerge
    as industry standards. A side benefit of fewer but dominant blockchain protocols
    is that it might be easier to achieve interoperability if the number of platforms
    is limited.

    at scale. A major priority is ensuring DeFi customers of digital currency stability.
    Again, the heart of DeFi is Ether, the ERC-20 token, whose value can and has fluctuated
    (Ether’s value fluctuated from $1,416 to $4,620 over the February 2021–2022 period,
    dropped from $4,384 to $1,786 in the May–July 2021 period, and was priced at $2,790
    on February 19, 2022). Stablecoin projects such as DAI have helped Maker command
    a leading position in the DeFi world, but DAI is not immune to instability, especially
    during a crisis. In the pandemic-induced March 2020 liquidity flight, for example,
    DAI could not maintain its parity link to the US dollar. Hence the availability
    and inclusion of fiat currency stablecoins such as CBDC is a critical step in
    growing DeFi and making it appealing to mainstream customers. If DeFi applications
    could be built on CBDC as they become available, that would facilitate mass market
    adoption and DeFi could seriously challenge and disintermediate traditional fractional
    reserve banking.

    are secure, digital custody wallets and digital currency sites represent possible
    points of failure. In an incident on April 19, 2020, nearly all of Lendf.me’s
    funds—around $24 million—were drained using a reentrancy hacker attack that had
    been discussed at Consensys Diligence (digital insurance) almost a year earlier.
    Because the hacker inadvertently exposed an IP address during the attack, Lendf.me
    was able to be recapture the funds.[43](14085-0014.xhtml#en207) And in February
    2022, Wormhole, a bridge linking Ethereum with the Solana blockchain was hacked,
    with about $320 million in losses.[44](14085-0014.xhtml#en208) As the number of
    distinct DeFi protocols increases, with several competing DeFi offerings in the
    same niche, flaws in the weaker, less well-tested protocols will be exploited,
    possibly discouraging potential new DeFi customers. At the same time, disclosure
    of such attacks can help the DeFi community learn about and better protect against
    such attack vectors.

    DeFi ecosystems can be strengthened with objective audits of its software and
    by ensuring protective steps are in place when launching upgrades or changing
    the DeFi system’s rules and standards. Open-source software could help too, as
    outsiders can monitor code upgrades, analyze attacks, and suggest improvements.
    Also helpful is the availability of several DeFi insurance products, such as Opyn
    Insurance, an Ethereum insurance protocol offering for DeFi users and Ether speculators
    that helps insure against Ether price volatility on deposits with Compound. Nexus
    Mutual is a mutual insurance firm, similar to Lloyd’s of London, that offers insurance
    to customers investing in DeFi firms such as Compound and Synthetix. As the size
