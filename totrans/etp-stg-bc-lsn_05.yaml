    risk capital from sources such as personal funds, angel investors, venture capitalists,
    institutional investors, and equity markets. Loan capital, with interest payable
    at fixed or varying rates, and secured to some extent with collateral, can flow
    to entrepreneurs from multiple sources too. Convincing sources of risk capital
    to invest in or lend to an entrepreneur’s ventures is not always easy, and for
    investors with capital to deploy, finding and qualifying worthy recipients is
    challenging. At the heart of these difficulties is the matter of trust. Can investors
    trust entrepreneurs and borrowers to use their capital as agreed upon and to use
    it prudently? Will interest and principal repayment be fulfilled on the agreed
    upon terms? This trust gap brings about the need for intermediaries who can conduct
    due diligence on behalf of investors and lenders and bring such aggregated information
    to their clients for review and decision.

    Ethereum have many advantages, but their volatility reduces their attractiveness
    as a store of value or means of exchange. Stablecoins are necessary for digital
    currencies to gain wide acceptance and to “cross the chasm” into mass market adoption.
    Stablecoins can be created by linking the stablecoin with fiat currency reserves
    on a one-to-one basis; stablecoins such as USDC (US Dollar Coin) or USDT (Tether)
    are created in this fashion, with USDC or Tether created in an amount equivalent
    to the total of US dollars held in reserves. An alternative approach is to use
    cryptocurrency reserves as the basis for issuing stablecoins, with continual algorithmic
    adjustment of the ratio of cryptocurrency reserves to stablecoins issued to adapt
    to the price volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency reserves. MakerDAO and
    its DAI stablecoin is one example of this approach.

    costs for small deal amounts), investment and speculation became the dominant
    motive for purchasing cryptocurrencies, with the hope that these currencies—Bitcoin,
    Ether—would appreciate, furnishing capital gains to their holders. Thus, Bitcoin
    and other digital currencies would be idle assets while awaiting appreciation.
    A December 2020 estimate suggested that “60 percent of all Bitcoin in the circulating

    to deploy their idle capital. Lending idle cryptocurrency creates liquidity and
    income for digital currency holders. The stablecoin model at Maker combines converting
    volatile cryptocurrency into stable digital currency, with a provision for lending
    the stablecoins created. This is analogous to banking and fractional reserve-based
    lending at commercial banks, in which banks hold reserves that are a fraction
    of total deposits on hand but can make loans that are many multiples of what is
    on hand because they are backed by a central authority such as the US Federal
    Reserve. This arrangement adds to the money supply.

    稳定币模型结合了将波动的加密货币转换为稳定的数字货币，以及为创建的稳定币提供贷款的条款。这类似于商业银行的银行和部分准备金基础贷款，其中银行持有的准备金是总存款的一部分，但可以发放的贷款是手头存款的许多倍，因为它们得到了中央权威机构如美国联邦储备银行的支持。这种安排增加了货币供应量。

    it defines the necessary basic functions that all smart contracts and ERC-20-compatible

- en: To counteract cryptocurrency instability, Maker pegged and maintains its DAI
    to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. Each DAI created is backed by the Ethereum token,
    Ether, and is deposited with Maker. The stablecoin creation process begins when
    a customer deposits Ether with Maker and agrees to lock up the deposited ETHER
    in a vault. Once the Ether has been deposited and secured, Maker’s collateral
    rules kick in with an internally set collateral-to-DAI ratio, initially established
    at, say, 150 percent. The collateral ratio is set by Maker governance members
    and is partly dependent on the volatility of the cryptocurrency underlying the
    collateral; the more volatile collateral would bear a higher collateral ratio.
    As the value of Ether fluctuates, some degree of overcollateralization is necessary—Maker’s
    intent is to boost confidence in DAI through overcollateralization, increasing
    the safety of the DAI stablecoin. At a 150 percent collateral ratio, depositing
    1 Ether (worth, say, $300 on cryptocurrency exchanges at the time of deposit)
    would allow the creation of 200 DAI, which the depositor of Ether could borrow
    (the collateralized debt position).

    DAI，以太币的存款人可以借款（抵押债务头寸）。
- en: This model, which creates DAI via a “permissionless credit factory on Ethereum,”[6](14085-0014.xhtml#en170)
    is similar to margin loans provided by stockbrokers. Margin loans allow an investor
    to avoid liquidating positions while still maintaining access to a portion of
    invested capital at a cost of the margin interest rate. When the borrower pays
    back the DAI, the Ether deposited in the vault can be retrieved, less a stability
    fee charge (akin to interest; the annual borrowing rate varies with the specific
    cryptocurrency deposited and the collateral ratio. When Ether was deposited at
    a 150 percent collateral ratio, the stability fee was around 3.5 percent in June
    2021).

    a variable interest rate in additional DAI, generated from the stability fee (the
    rate is determined by Maker governors). In effect, Maker offers a savings account

- en: DAI is tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges, and Maker relies on arbitrage and
    the link to deposited collateral to maintain the DAI-to-dollar parity. Raising
    or lowering the stability fee results in reduced debt or increased borrowing,
    changing the demand for and supply of DAI. If DAI drops to $0.99, the debtor can
    purchase 200 DAI for $198 and repay the original 200 DAI debt, making a small
    gain. When the DAI is repaid, it is removed from circulation, reducing the total
    supply of DAI and raising its price, bringing it back into parity with the US
    dollar. If the DAI repaid were not canceled, the total amount of DAI would exceed
    the amount of collateral, causing DAI value to drop below the desired 1:1 parity
    with the dollar. This process is illustrated in figure 4.2.

  zh: DAI可以在加密货币交易所交易。Maker通过套利以及与存入抵押品之间的联系来维持DAI与美元的平价。提高或降低稳定费会导致债务减少或借款增加，从而改变DAI的需求和供应。如果DAI跌至0.99美元，借款人可以用198美元购买200
    DAI并偿还原始的200 DAI债务，小赚一笔。当DAI偿还时，它会被从流通中移除，减少DAI的总量，提高其价格，使其与美元恢复平价。如果偿还的DAI没有被取消，DAI的总量将超过抵押品的金额，导致DAI的价值低于与美元所期望的1:1的平价。这个过程在图4.2中有所说明。

    can access this wallet, and the DAI or MKR coins sent to this wallet are irretrievably
    lost. Conversely, if a collateral liquidation along with DAI in the Maker Buffer
    is insufficient to fully pay off a debt position, MKR is minted and sold for DAI
    to fully liquidate the debt, lowering the MKR token price as a result. (Note that

    interbank lending rate is greater than IOER, then banks will loan or expand credit
    and vice versa. Similarly, Maker can adjust the collateral level, the liquidation
    of undercollateralized debt, and the stability fee to influence the creation of
    DAI loans, subject to its self-imposed debt ceiling. It is important to note that

- en: Compound accepts a broad range of Ethereum assets (e.g., Ether, DAI, Tether),
    though not every Ethereum-compatible token asset is supported. Ethereum token
    owners can deposit their Ethereum-compatible token assets in Compound and lend
    them via the Compound protocol, earning interest on what would otherwise be an
    idle asset. The interest rate on borrowing is algorithmically determined and varies
    by asset, depending on the demand/supply interaction for that Ethereum asset;
    smart contracts match supply with demand and compute a continuously varying interest
    rate. The Compound protocol permits lenders to borrow from the pool of a specific
    asset (e.g., the Ether pool). Pools are created by combining the Ether deposited
    by all of Compound’s clients. Thus, lenders do not directly lend to borrowers;
    instead, the Compound protocol provides a loan from the pool of a specific asset
    to borrowers seeking to borrow that particular asset.

  zh: Compound接受广泛的以太坊资产（例如，以太币、DAI、泰达币），尽管并非所有与以太坊兼容的代币资产都被支持。以太坊代币所有者可以在Compound中存入其与以太坊兼容的代币资产，并通过Compound协议出借，从而在原本闲置的资产上获得利息。借款的利率由算法确定，并因资产而异，这取决于该以太坊资产的需求/供应互动；智能合约匹配供应与需求并计算出连续变化的利率。Compound协议允许出借者从特定资产（例如，以太币池）的池中借款。池是通过结合Compound所有客户存入的以太币创建的。因此，出借者并未直接向借款者出借；相反，Compound协议为寻求借入特定资产的借款者提供来自该特定资产池的贷款。
- en: By aggregating assets supplied by all the users, and lending from this pool,
    Compound increases liquidity for each lender. Lenders can also withdraw assets
    without waiting for a specific loan to mature. In doing so, Compound creates frictionless
    borrowing of Ethereum tokens, without P2P negotiation of debt maturity, the interest
    rate, or collateral. Borrowers must deposit their own Ethereum-compatible tokens
    on Compound as collateral, with the total amount they could borrow being a portion
    of the amount of collateral deposited. The value of each asset provided as collateral
    is determined by a price oracle, which pools prices for that asset from the top
    ten cryptocurrency exchanges. The amount that a borrower can borrow depends on
    the riskiness of the assets furnished as collateral. These assets vary in their
    collateral strength, varying from zero to one for riskier to less risky assets.
    The riskier the collateral, the smaller the amount that can be borrowed against
    that collateral. If a user exceeds their borrowing capacity because of a decline
    in the value of collateral, a portion of the borrowing is repaid with collateral
    discounted at a certain rate. This is also known as the liquidation discount,
    and it creates an incentive for arbitragers in the Compound community to step
    in and pay off portions of the debt with their assets of the same type, in turn
    taking ownership of the portion of the borrower’s collateral that would have been
    liquidated.

    Compound 社区中的套利者创造了介入并用自己的同类资产偿还部分债务的激励，进而获得将被清算的借款人抵押品的一部分所有权。

    in achieving greater returns through “yield farming,” which helps Ethereum asset
    owners put their idle assets to work. In yield farming, digital currency owners—liquidity
    providers—lock up their assets in a liquidity pool, which uses smart contracts
    to lend from the pool. The liquidity providers who have contributed their assets
    to the pool earn transaction fees, interest on the loan, and, sometimes, governance

    of securities trades, with settlement times of around two days. The country averaged

    trades to reflect changes in ownership and payment for the securities traded.
    To protect against counterpart risk of nonpayment, financial institutions set
    aside capital to cover the risks before actual settlement. In addition, they maintain
    their own records of delivery and settlement. Reconciling conflicting information
    consumes resources and takes time, and thus improving these back-office functions
    (which are often mainframe-based batch processes) could reduce settlement times
    and save on costs. Centralized exchanges such as Coinbase have emerged to facilitate
    digital asset trading and custody, and they improve on the drawbacks inherent

- en: Balancer Exchange is one such protocol that allows users to trade a variety
    of ERC20-compatible tokens while also creating “programmable liquidity.” Balancer
    offers liquidity pools featuring portfolios containing several different ERC20
    token assets with underlying tokens of different weights in each distinct portfolio.
    This means Balancer can provide access to ETF-type cryptocurrency portfolios.
    In a shared liquidity pool, the creator of that pool decides which tokens will
    be accepted in the pool, with a maximum of eight different tokens, and sets weights
    for each token within the portfolio. Once the tokens and their weights are chosen
    for that shared liquidity pool, they cannot be changed.

    ERC20 代币资产的投资组合的流动性池，每个独立投资组合的基础代币权重不同。这意味着 Balancer 可以为 ETF 类型的加密货币投资组合提供访问权限。在共享流动性池中，该池的创建者决定池中将接受哪些代币，最多八种不同的代币，并为投资组合中的每种代币设置权重。一旦为该共享流动性池选择了代币及其权重，它们就不能更改。
- en: A Balancer user then reviews the different portfolios available and decides
    which portfolio they would like to invest in, choosing a portfolio where the weighted
    averages of the currencies in that specific portfolio match their investor preferences.
    To invest in that portfolio, users swap some of their cryptocurrency holdings
    with other users, on cryptocurrency exchanges, to generate specific amounts of
    each of the currency components in that portfolio, which they then contribute
    to Balancer to gain a share of the portfolio. Furthermore, once an investor is
    part of a liquidity pool, that investor can earn fees in exchange for providing
    liquidity and facilitating trading of cryptocurrencies in their pool. So instead
    of paying an ETF money manager, ETF investors in Balancer earn income by virtue
    of making an investment, independent of any other income generated by the portfolio
    such as interest or appreciation.

    Balancer 以获得投资组合的份额。此外，一旦投资者成为流动性池的一部分，该投资者可以通过提供流动性并促进他们池中加密货币的交易来赚取费用。因此，Balancer
    中的 ETF 投资者通过投资获得收入，而与投资组合产生的任何其他收入（如利息或增值）无关。

    specific cryptocurrency for another. Once a trader places a swap order, an algorithm
    executes this swap across some subset of the liquidity portfolios so that the
    portfolio composition weights are preserved even as the prices of the underlying
    tokens change. Different portfolios will offer different prices depending on their
    need to swap currencies to maintain the desired portfolio composition, perhaps
    lowering prices for tokens that they have an excess of and need to sell to bring
    the portfolio back into balance.

- en: One consequence of such automatic market making and automatic balancing is that
    larger orders are likely to cause prices to vary more since the larger order will
    have a greater effect on a portfolio’s balance across the desired portfolio composition
    weights.[15](14085-0014.xhtml#en179) This price change, termed “slippage,” is
    broadcasted to traders at the time of placing an order so that they can set limits
    on how much slippage is acceptable for the order to be executed. Such traders
    pay swap fees as set by each portfolio, and the algorithm favors trades with portfolios
    that have lower swap fees (as a percentage of the trade amount), provided they
    have the specific tokens being sought by the user. Taken together, the portfolios
    earn swap fees for providing liquidity in specific currencies, while the algorithm
    drives portfolios to lower their swap fees, thus lowering trading costs across
    the Balancer system.

    to trade on the expected performance of underlying assets without having to own
    the asset itself (e.g., stock call and put options). Synthetix, a blockchain start-up,
    created a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum that
    also functions as a trading platform for synthetic forms of fiat currencies (e.g.,
    DAI as a synthetic form of the US dollar), cryptocurrencies, and commodities.
    It offers decentralized derivatives trading, generating native tokens called SNX
    that are tied to the value of collateral deposited with the Synthetix protocol.
    In this case, the ERC20 tokens deposited are digital representations of various
    assets such as fiat currencies (US dollar, euro, etc.), cryptocurrencies, and
    commodities (gold, silver). These could be extended in the future to other real
    assets such as equities.

  zh: 衍生品是交易系统中另一个重要的组成部分。它们允许投资者在不拥有基础资产的情况下交易资产预期的表现（例如，股票的看涨和看跌期权）。Synthetix是一家区块链初创公司，它创建了一个基于以太坊的去中心化合成资产发行协议，该协议也是一个用于交易法币（例如，DAI作为美元的合成形式）、加密货币和商品的合成形式的交易平台。它提供去中心化衍生品交易，生成与抵押品价值挂钩的原生代币SNX。在这种情况下，存入的ERC20代币是各种资产的数字表示，如法币（美元、欧元等）、加密货币和商品（黄金、白银）。将来还可以扩展到其他实物资产，如股票。
- en: After generating SNX in the system, users can lock the SNX and mint a second
    token, Synths, with a high collateralization ratio of 800 percent or greater.
    Thus eight hundred SNX could generate one hundred Synths, which can be exchanged
    for derivatives of fiat and cryptocurrencies and commodities. Price changes of
    the chosen asset and the derivative’s value are tracked by an oracle; in the case
    of cryptocurrencies, Synths can also be used to short them, thus tracking declines
    in the price of Ether, Bitcoin, and more.

- en: Each trade of a Synth generates a fee, around 0.3 percent, on average, which
    goes to SNX holders as a reward for staking collateral. SNX holders can also earn
    an additional reward from a weekly increase in the number of SNX at 1.25 percent
    a week through 2023\. Synths are the users’ debt and must be repaid for the SNX
    collateral to be unlocked. The user debt changes continuously as a proportion
    of an individual user’s debt to the total debt of the Synthetix system as a whole,
    with total debt value changing as the price of the underlying assets change. As
    Synthetix explains, “in this way, SNX stakers act as a pooled counterparty to
    all Synth exchanges; stakers take on the risk of the overall debt in the system.”[17](14085-0014.xhtml#en181)

- en: Synthetix is also experimenting with Ether alone as collateral, which would
    require a lower collateral ratio of 150 percent and allow users to generate Synths
    directly against Ether rather than first exchange them for SNX. The user debt
    is then denominated in Ether, and the user does not participate in the pooled
    debt aspect of the system nor do they receive fees or rewards (because they do
    not assume debt pool risks). Because risk hedging of a larger volume is possible,
    trader access to digital asset derivatives markets increases trading volume, which
    improves market efficiency. As blockchain firms gain experience with decentralized
    stablecoins, P2P lending, DEXs, and derivatives markets, the same principles and
    mechanisms can be used to develop decentralized marketplaces. Over time, the swarm
    of competing protocols delivering similar functionality will thin out, and a few
    robust and full-featured protocols could become dominant. This process is being
    hastened with the rise of industry-wide consortia such as R3/Corda and Ripple,
    which are becoming widely adopted, allowing third-party apps to be built on top
    of these standard protocols, increasing their utility and helping them become
    industry standards.

    Launching the sale of tokens on an exchange is akin to floating new offerings
    through a lead underwriter. The exchange selects which token sales to host and
    subsequently list on its exchange. Selection is determined by parameters such
    as the issuing company’s potential, the issue quality, and maintaining the exchange’s
    reputation as a place to trade quality tokens. Potential token buyers become members
    of the exchange to bid for tokens, with exchanges often requiring that buyers
    hold that exchange’s tokens and pay for the issuing company’s new tokens with

    DB was interested in developing a proof of concept: can we model and execute a
    bond life cycle on blockchain—from clearing securities and finalizing settlement
    to triggering interest payments—and thus implement bond amortization and retirement?
    The first step was to convince decision-makers that blockchain could bring competitive
    benefits, and a pilot project to develop and implement a prototype could help
    inform future decisions about deploying blockchain in this space. The project
    initiators had to become evangelists and bring together a community of enthusiasts
    from diverse areas—legal, data analytics, IT, finance, client relations, and partner
    relations—to form a coalition that would help seek organizational support. To
    get budget approval, the project needed high-level champions with budget oversight
    authority and influence over strategic direction. Initial funding approval came
    once such champions were convinced to support a pilot.'

    to claims processing and payments. If policyholders agree to opt in and permit
    deployment, Groupama Insurance, for example, places IoT smart sensors on insured
    cars to track location, speed, acceleration, and related variables, enabling it
    to offer and deploy AI-aided insurance. Its policyholders are offered a discount
    on premiums in return for using the IoT sensors. One benefit of using them is
    real-time communication of collisions; if deemed serious, emergency services can
    be dispatched immediately, possibly saving lives.

- en: The potential for blockchain deployment in insurance has led to the launch of
    blockchain protocols specific to insurance, such as the Etherisc pilot. This P2P
    flight insurance pilot, built with the Etherisc protocol, pays the insured for
    flight cancellations or delays. It works by a smart contract first issuing the
    insurance in response to a request initiated by a client; payment is authorized
    when oracles verify a flight delay. This automates both issuance and claim processing
    in a transparent decentralized fashion. Another interesting pilot of the Etherisc
    application is crop microinsurance to small paddy rice farmers in Sri Lanka[38](14085-0014.xhtml#en202)
    through a collaboration between Aon, Sanasa, and Oxfam. Oxfam coupled its deep
    experience working with farmer communities in emerging markets to Etherisc’s blockchain
    protocol and decentralized risk pool expertise. Aon brought its expertise in reinsurance
    and innovative policy design to the project, while Sanasa added its local insurance
    industry and cultural knowledge. Many farmers in Sri Lanka’s remote areas are
    unbanked, with limited incomes and liquidity; bureaucracy and banking infrastructure
    is physically and financially out of reach for this population too. The proof-of-concept
    goal is to use blockchain to lower costs and increase efficiency while facilitating
    a farmer’s access to affordable microinsurance with fair and transparent payout
    upon occurrence of extreme weather (which could cause crop losses).

    over their financial operations and personal data. Blockchains can offer a secure
    and lower-cost environment in which to conduct financial asset transactions, provide
    record keeping and regulatory compliance, and engineer cryptocurrency/digital
    currency stability. These environments are ideal for organizing exchanges in which
    to trade digital assets as well as financial instruments that are linked to the
    performance of those digital assets (i.e., derivatives). Each major category of
    DeFi innovation has built on previous advances. In response, incumbents have launched
    blockchain pilots and projects of their own, one of the better-known examples
    being JPMorgan’s Quorum, a private version of Ethereum. The Quorum blockchain
    was a response to the challenge from emerging DeFi entrants. It aims to prevent
    the erosion of JPMorgan’s market position and to allow it to compete in the emerging
    DeFi world. Quorum has attracted over three hundred banks to its Interbank Information
    Network, which is integrated with the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

  zh: 基于区块链的DeFi可能更加便宜和安全，并能让用户控制自己的财务操作和个人信息。区块链可以提供一个安全、成本较低的环境，用于进行金融资产交易、记录保存和遵守监管规定，并确保加密货币/数字货币的稳定性。这些环境非常适合组织交易，用于交易数字资产以及与这些数字资产表现挂钩的金融工具（即衍生品）。DeFi创新的每一个主要类别都建立在之前的发展之上。作为回应，现有企业推出了自己的区块链试点项目和项目，其中较为知名的是摩根大通的Quorum，这是一个以太坊的私有版本。Quorum区块链是为了应对新兴DeFi参与者的挑战而推出的。它旨在防止摩根大通市场地位的侵蚀，并允许其参与新兴的DeFi世界。Quorum吸引了超过300家银行加入其银行信息网络，该网络与微软Azure云平台集成。
- en: JPMorgan’s Quorum team adapted the original open-source Ethereum protocol to
    address the confidentiality needs of enterprises by adding privacy features (e.g.,
    allowing for anonymity of both sender and recipient) as well as by offering users
    the ability to conceal the amounts or specifics of assets being traded.[40](14085-0014.xhtml#en204)
    JPMorgan planned to make such extensions available to third parties that could
    build vertical applications incorporating such privacy, such as Komgo’s energy
    trading application (Komgo is a group of companies using blockchain to improve
    trade commodity finance and related applications). To increase acceptance and
    uptake across enterprises, JPMorgan’s Quorum merged with Consensys to launch Consensys
    Quorum, to offer both public and private enterprise solutions as well as robust
    features attractive to enterprises while maintaining open-source development.[41](14085-0014.xhtml#en205)

    Hyperledger Fabric (from IBM) along with open-source protocols, such as Hyperledger

    that Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, and Quorum accounted for 86 percent of all unique
    blockchain developers placing code on GitHub.[42](14085-0014.xhtml#en206) Over
    time, competing protocols will merge and a few surviving platforms will emerge
    as industry standards. A side benefit of fewer but dominant blockchain protocols
    is that it might be easier to achieve interoperability if the number of platforms
    is limited.

    at scale. A major priority is ensuring DeFi customers of digital currency stability.
    Again, the heart of DeFi is Ether, the ERC-20 token, whose value can and has fluctuated
    (Ether’s value fluctuated from $1,416 to $4,620 over the February 2021–2022 period,
    dropped from $4,384 to $1,786 in the May–July 2021 period, and was priced at $2,790
    on February 19, 2022). Stablecoin projects such as DAI have helped Maker command
    a leading position in the DeFi world, but DAI is not immune to instability, especially
    during a crisis. In the pandemic-induced March 2020 liquidity flight, for example,
    DAI could not maintain its parity link to the US dollar. Hence the availability
    and inclusion of fiat currency stablecoins such as CBDC is a critical step in
    growing DeFi and making it appealing to mainstream customers. If DeFi applications
    could be built on CBDC as they become available, that would facilitate mass market
    adoption and DeFi could seriously challenge and disintermediate traditional fractional
    reserve banking.

    funds—around $24 million—were drained using a reentrancy hacker attack that had
    been discussed at Consensys Diligence (digital insurance) almost a year earlier.
    Because the hacker inadvertently exposed an IP address during the attack, Lendf.me
    was able to be recapture the funds.[43](14085-0014.xhtml#en207) And in February
    2022, Wormhole, a bridge linking Ethereum with the Solana blockchain was hacked,

    distinct DeFi protocols increases, with several competing DeFi offerings in the
    same niche, flaws in the weaker, less well-tested protocols will be exploited,
    possibly discouraging potential new DeFi customers. At the same time, disclosure
    of such attacks can help the DeFi community learn about and better protect against
    such attack vectors.
