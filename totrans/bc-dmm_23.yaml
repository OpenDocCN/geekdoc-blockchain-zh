    as Simple as Possible'

- en: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), smart contracts, and chaincode
    are all the rage at the moment. The promise of cutting administration and legal
    cost is very enticing to many corporations. A sometimes overlooked characteristic
    of this technology is that it is just code. That means that there is no human
    being interpreting the rules that you’ve laid out for everyone to follow. The
    code becomes law, and the law only stretches to what is incorporated into the
    blockchain contract. The “fat” that was cut can sometimes be very important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no one to interpret the code. That means that if the code is executed
    in a fashion that you did not expect, there is also no one to enforce the intent
    of the contract. The code is law and nothing unlawful occurred. That’s why you
    should to keep your contracts simple and modular in nature to contain and predict
    the outcomes of contract fulfillment. It’s also a good idea to have your contract
    tested and beaten up even by other developers who are incentivized to break it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reach of the blockchain you’re building your project on matters, too. You
    can think of it like jurisdictions. Sure, a smart contract can execute on outside
    data, but the smart contract cannot demand funds from accounts that they do not
    have access to. That means that all the value must be set aside in some manner,
    which may encumber cash flow.

    uses to execute against. If it’s weather data for an insurance contract, do you
    trust and agree on the source? Is it possible to manipulate the source data? A
    lot of thought should go into the oracle source before implementation.  ## Publish
    with Great Caution'
  prefs: []

- en: The whole point of blockchains is that once data is put in, it’s hard to take
    it out. That means that what you put in will be around for a long time. If you
    publish encrypted sensitive information, you need to be okay with the fact that
    the encrypted data may one day be broken and what you published may be readable
    to anyone.

    it and make copies. Also keep in mind that printers often have access to the Internet

    printers that have no access to the web. Keep your paper wallet copies in different
    locations such as a bank vault and a secure location in your home.

    designed specifically for that purpose. Strong passwords are harder to remember.
    You might consider writing down your password and laminating it like your private
    keys. There are limited password recovery options within cryptocurrency, and a
    forgotten password could mean lost tokens.  ## Triple-Check the Address Before

    income tax return.
