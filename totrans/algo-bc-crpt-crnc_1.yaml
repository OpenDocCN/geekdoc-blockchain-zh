    of self-employability at the expense of job security and the guaranteed availability
    of short to medium term paid work. Similar to the previously discussed platform
    businesses, we predict the increase in the usage of such business structures looking
    to connect the availability of Bitworkers with the skill shortages and potential
    providers of both work and consequential payment. Matching of this human resource
    may take place using a blockchain system which is able to connect mutually interested
    parties without the need for a centralised trusted arbiter.

    or other such variables, whereby a worker may seek to advertise their availability
    across multiple blockchain exchanges concurrently subject to the rules of membership
    of each respective blockchain. Expanding upon the *digital cooperative* (DCOP)
    proposed in [Chapter 2](CH002.html), such labour exchanges may become not-for-profit
    vehicles sponsored by the state, regions, trade professions or even by private
    corporations. In contrast, it is feasible to envisage profit seeking alternatives
    which purport to provide superior or more exclusive opportunities in return for
    a larger membership fee which could accrue to shareholder, members or a mixture
    of both.

    exchange (DEX), which is relatively a new technology that seeks to mitigate the
    risk of mistrust and misdemeanour by a centralised body. DEXs permit peer-to-peer
    exchange of value. Presently, they are almost exclusively used for the trading
    of cryptocurrencies. One such example is Ether Delta whose founder made settlement
    with the Securities and Exchange Committee for allegedly operating an unregistered

    likely involve significant *Know Your Client* (KYC) vetting. This would become
    increasingly important for safety critical professions requiring such surety and
    perhaps even full transparency for the respective regulators, where it was in
    the interest of the public and wider society. The underlying blockchain technology,
    although just a variant of a database, lends itself well to such a matching process
    (of labour) which requires real-time access for multiple stakeholders recorded
    in an immutable audit trail.^([1](#fn1)) It is this audit trail which will offer
    transparency to current and potential members (Bitworkers) and potential contract
    hirers. Essentially, a system delivers trust from mistrust. However, with the
    absence of a centralised arbiter, a decentralised financial (or *DeFin*) solution
    will be required to maintain the accuracy and robustness of this ledger, or audit
    trail. It is possible that this could be done using a decentralised mining pool
    of validating nodes, similar to that of Bitcoin, leaving the labour exchange exposed
    only to a 51% attack from a targeted hack perhaps through the use of quantum computing
    technology.^([2](#fn2))

    of pseudo-anonymous systems, such as Bitcoin, and the existence of blockchain-enabled
    communities which permit users to transfer value outside of existing regulatory
    structures pose a headache to say the least. It is therefore possible that such
    *decentralised labour exchanges* (DLEXs) will require authorisation from arbiters
    such as national and international regulators. Following on from this reasoning,
    it is plausible that such *DEX* permissions will be preconditioned by the veil
    of anonymity or pseudo-anonymity being lifted to mitigate the risk of tax evasion
    with respect to consequential work obtained and performed in this manner. From
    August 2019, the IRS and HMRC are engaged in contacting individuals suspected
    of failing to declare their historical gains from cryptocurrency trading. Many
    believe that such an agenda is impossible given the pseudo-anonymous nature of
    the technology. However, forced disclosure of KYC information held by cryptocurrency
    exchanges is facilitating this effort by tax authorities. Much of this may be
    a public relations strategy rather than a meaningful attempt to claw back hitherto
    untaxed gains from the shadow economy but nonetheless must be a consideration
    in our evaluation of the future viability for DEXs of labour.

    of contract sizes and durations, etc. This is the case currently for precious
    metal exchanges such as The New York Mercantile Exchange and COMEX, the equivalent
    for commodities. For our hypothesised labour exchange, a common unit of work would
    need to be predefined. This may be a previously discussed *Bit task*, a unit of
    chargeable time (e.g. an hour/day/week), or a predefined project which itself
    may be bespoke in nature. Much of the nature of standardisation will depend upon
    the skill level of workers and the needs of potential contract hire firms. Furthermore,
    the transparency and trust afforded by the blockchain infrastructure would give
    a potential contract hire firm full visibility to the concurrent workload for
    an individual worker both historically and at the present time. This could potentially
    also include worker reviews and endorsements, not too dissimilar to a LinkedIn
    plus type system, which thereby becomes an immutable CV to better aid evaluation
    and hiring. Indeed, future work or contract commitments by worker or provider
    of work could be made available too where appropriate.

    would lend themselves more easily to the above compared to physical or contact-oriented
    professions, such as builder, teacher or care work. This is not to say that the
    latter professions could not be efficiently allocated using a DLEX but that their
    units of time would likely be broken down into larger chunks, for example, six-month
    short-term contracts in contrast to Bit tasks of the digital worker. These latter
    digital professions are also more ably suited to a global audience which would
    mean that a citizen in Thailand can feasibly source work concurrently from organisations
    in Estonia, Mexico and India. Moreover, such individuals would now be more flexible
    in terms of their own physical location and tax domicile akin to the *digital

    by the technology of our triumvirate. However, it is clear that such flexibility
    of work would not be suitable for all professions and demographics. It is this
    suitability that at the point of hiring can be more readily evaluated using artificial
    intelligence (AI) techniques. Presently, some leading US recruitment companies
    use AI to digest approximately 25,000 attributes of a candidate interview video
    before they are matched to potential employers. Variables such as eye contact
    and speech intonation are all used as markers to identify likely traits and qualities,
    or lack thereof. It must be stressed that this is technology that although bleeding
    edge is already here now rather than some envisaged future possibility. Moreover,
    in the UK organisations such as Red Wigwam, although more people oriented in their
    evaluation of temporary candidate workers, also employs AI to match workers to
    employers for contracts of between 15 minutes and 3 months in duration. A movement
    towards ever decreasing task durations as our predicted Bitworker and Bit task

    negative cash flow despite reasonable levels of profitability. This thinking is
    clearly understood by present day sole traders and independent contractors the
    world over giving rise to key phrases such as ‘cash is king’ and ‘it’s not a sale
    until the customer has paid’. Many solutions in the current economy exist to mitigate
    these risks. Examples include invoice discounting and factoring which involves
    the sale of a company’s debts, or sales ledger, at an amount less than the gross
    sale figure in return for immediate cash. This can be an expensive source of financing
    the negative working capital requirement as a company grows and can typically
    cost between 5% and 15% of the gross sale depending upon the industry, quality
    of the debtors (receivables) and whether the arrangement is on a recourse or non-recourse

    One such potential solution will be the application of a more advanced type of
    smart contract which we previously discussed. Such smart contracts can be created
    to permit the transfer of funds between individuals (their wallets), between an
    individual and a smart contract or finally, perhaps between two smart contracts.
    The funds that may vest in this manner between transferor and transferee are typically
    The European Research Council (ERC) 20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain which
    is the industry standard for hosting such smart contracts. These contracts can
    hold cryptocurrency funds between two counterparties at the inception of a sale
    or trade which will then be automatically transferred subject to certain condition(s)
    being met.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps most simply, the condition can be one of a time constraint in line with
    the conditions of sale or purchase agreed, for example, 90 days after date of
    invoice. However, alternatives do exist such as approval by both parties, or even
    approval by an additional third party. Similarly, AI and oracles can be used to
    validate that a particular event has occurred in order to release funds based
    upon external data sources. If it can be imagined and coded then it is possible.
    The advantage may not be immediately obvious but in a hard coded world where money
    is paid exactly when it should be there is no delay in payments being made, no
    money lost in chasing bad debts and businesses is consequently more likely to
    succeed subject to their cash forecasting calculations being correct. An improvement
    on the current escrow account that there is no need for a third-party custodian
    as this role is now fulfilled more cheaply and accurately by an impartial smart
    contract. Moreover, this can now be a viable approach on a much smaller scale
    owing to the vastly reduced costs by comparison. Expanding this out on a macro-scale,
    we envisage a world with greater employment through more companies succeeding
    where previously they may have failed. Trust is improved, uncertainty reduced
    and the cost of capital falls thereby increasing the likelihood of investment
    which drives growth and employment further.

    We also predict potential advancement in the provision of personal finance, particularly
    in the payday loan and traditional term loan industries. Payday loans came to
    the fore in the 1990s and have gone on to become significant industries the world
    over, where permitted by legal, regulatory and religious restrictions. The largest
    markets globally include; USA, Netherlands, UK, Canada and Australia. Typified
    by moderate to small loan provisions over very short periods, the loans are charged
    at aggressive rates of interest, sometimes many thousands of percent per annum.
    Often expensive and poor value for a demographic of society with little choice
    to obtain finance elsewhere. Legislation has therefore sought to protect their
    vulnerability, for example, in the UK in 2014, interest rates on such loans were
    capped at 0.8% per day by the regulator, The Financial Conduct Authority. In contrast,
    the Netherlands limited this to 12% over the base rate whereas Australia chose
    4% per month which equates to just over 60% per annum under the effect of that
    cruel mistress, compound interest.

    space for the benefit of the Bitworker in the form of microsecuritisations offered
    by cryptocurrencies such as MAKR’s © DAI stablecoin or token administered through
    their DAO.^([5](#fn5)),^([6](#fn6)) A single DAI coin is backed by Ethereum and
    is pegged to one US dollar which has been relatively stable, as is the intention,
    over time since its inception in 2017\. The peg is administered in a decentralised
    manner on the Maker Dao’s platform where users can deposit their Ethereum within
    a bespoke collateralised debt positions (CDPs) in return for DAI coins to the
    value of the underlying Ethereum less a haircut. Similar to that of a pawnbroking
    arrangement, the user still has the rights to the underlying Ethereum and can
    at any point during the life of the CDP redeem the Ethereum by returning the DAI
    coins originally issued. This permits the volatility of Ethereum to be traded
    away for the stability of the DAI coin without giving up the upside potential
    of the underlying Ethereum price movements. In contrast, should the price of the
    underlying Ethereum fall beyond the buffer of the aforementioned haircut then
    the CDP is automatically liquidated in order to preserve the integrity of the
    one DAI to one US dollar peg. An innovative piece of decentralised financial engineering
    which vastly reduces the scale requirement of the securitisation industry which
    historically has required underlying asset values in the hundreds of millions
    of dollars to warrant the expense of establishment and maintenance. This industry
    has typically focussed on large illiquid assets such as unsecured loan pools,
    real estate (*real estate investment* trusts) and mortgage books of business.
    MAKR © have outlined a desire to open this structure up to other types of assets
    including Bitcoin and gold. Organisations offer above market rate remuneration
    to buy up future time of individuals, in substance a short/medium term contract
    of employment.

    to securitise their future time in the format of smart contracts within CDPs.
    Similarly, this would then allow Bitworkers to monetise their future selves and
    draw down on that today in the form of DAI (stablecoin cryptocurrency) thereby
    effectively serving as a payday, or even term, loan. Owing to the decentralised
    nature of this structure, more reasonable rates of interest would be possible
    to the advantage of the Bitworker. However, challenges would ensue regarding the
    intangible nature of the asset backing regarding contingency failure to make good
    on the securitised future time as well as how to price and gain comfort over the
    different earning rates of competing Bitworkers.

    increased significantly from weekly or monthly to near real-time contemporaneous
    production, consumption and payment of goods and services. This is possible due
    to the enabling of microtransactions using cryptocurrencies on a decentralised
    blockchain platform. See the next chapter for a full discussion of the macroeconomic
    impact of this occurrence in the *Internet of Things* economy. Furthermore, to
    be employed, or tenured, may become the exception rather than the rule where the

    power of choice of work and physical domicile accrues to the worker. The organisations
    of the future must therefore adapt to align their talent resourcing accordingly.
    Perhaps most challengingly will be how such workers of the future will be managed
    and their interests aligned with that of the organisation. It has long been understood
    that a problem of agency, known as *agency theory* exists to between the misalignment
    of interests between directors and shareholders. Perhaps more worryingly a greater
    misalignment, at least in aggregate, may now exist between shareholders and their
    increasingly fragmented Bitworker labour force. Such workers may be working concurrently
    across multiple employers raising concerns for employers around commercial sensitivity
    and competitiveness as well as the risk that a different employer is being prioritised
    at your expense in the Bitworker’s work portfolio. Moreover, such Bitworkers will
    be engaged in microtasks or Bit tasks which by definition will be short term in
    duration. These workers will then be spending time sourcing future engagements
    before their present engagement concludes perhaps to the detriment of their work
    effort, which you are paying for. Such Bitworkers are likely to be temporally
    sensitive in that they prioritise decisions and project implementation which either
    increases the likelihood of being hired again going forward or perhaps ensuring
    that gains and favourable feedback accrue to them in the short term rather than
    a different Bitworker further down the line. Regardless, such sub-optimal decision
    making, although rational for the Bitworker, is detrimental to shareholder interests.
    Famous examples of such myopia leading to poor decision making by Directors include
    the ponzi schemes of Bernie Maddoff and the regulatory and accounting breaches
    of Enron leading to a jail sentence and an ultimate corporate collapse, respectively.
    These agency problems are however less frequent as the actions of board directors
    are heavily scrutinised by analysts and the wider markets, particularly for larger
    listed organisations. We do however note the trend towards, relatively inconsequential
    fines for wrong doing, where an organisation accepts an initial fine rather than
    face further investigation. In effect they have the ability to buy off scrutiny.
    This is compounded by the ‘newness’ of, particularly data and privacy scandals.
    The law here is still evolving and legal definitions of a crime lag behind societal
    ones. It is interesting to note how consumer and societal action can have a far
    greater effect on moderating and limiting negative organisational behaviours than
    legal or regulatory pressure. The unique challenge of the agency problem at the
    Bitworker level, termed *operational agency theory* (OAT), is that for a single
    worker it is much smaller scale and therefore more difficult to identify, not
    to mention manage and correct for. Importantly though, the aggregate effect of
    such agent-based failings may be greater than that of traditional agency theory
    at board level thereby acting as a sustained drag on corporate performance. This
    hypothesised OAT drag may serve as a natural brake on the fragmentation of the
    labour force thereby incentivising organisations to maintain a larger proportion
    of permanent employed workers than they might otherwise choose to do so going
    forward.

    the use of derivatives.^([8](#fn8)) The future availability and price of skills
    procured sourced via DLEXs would become a significant risk factor for many organisations.
    Where new risk occurs financial engineering and secondary markets soon follow
    thereby facilitating the repackaging and sale of risk between parties who do not
    wish to suffer it compared to those that will in return for a fee. The consequential
    creation of derivatives denominated in worker time by profession is then entirely
    possible. The purchase of a futures contract on 10,000 hours of solicitor time
    at a rate of £300.00 per hour during quarter one 2020 in the Northwest of the
    UK is possible and of clear commercial value to a large law firm in Manchester
    such as DLA Piper or Eversheds Sutherland (International).^([9](#fn9)) In contrast,
    a call option on 4,000 mining hours in Western Australia during the next fiscal
    year for a rate of AUD$ 100.00 per hour would be of interest to the likes of BHP
    Billiton or Rio Tinto.^([10](#fn10)) Invariably, speculators would follow who
    would trade labour by profession and regions owing to shifting local, regional
    and macroeconomic needs although it may be some time before we see labour desks
    on the trading floor of leading investment banks such as Goldman Sachs. Perhaps
    more likely would be the emergence of exclusion or block-out provisions which
    would give comfort to employers whilst compensating workers who allow them to
    dominate their time. A potential win-win for both parties but a provision which
    is likely only to be afforded to the more highly skilled professions and those
    where previous employer feedback and ratings are particularly high. This may put
    further pressure on the disaffected areas of our global societies who perceive,

    interpret the opportunities and threats for their workers and the triumvirate
    technology impact. This ranges from countries like Switzerland and Estonia who
    are championing this new technology through to India who have largely banned the
    trading of cryptocurrencies by example. Overall, the dynamic of power and consequent
    profit will, and is, split three ways between that of decentralised solutions
    for the individual (e.g. Bitcoin), the nation state (e.g. Central Bank Digital-issued
    Currencies) and the corporation (e.g. JP Morgan). Technologically speaking, the
    minting of new currency is no longer the preserve of a nation state so the continued
    trend of such corporate-issued non-sovereign currencies is expected.

    a monetary system allows the controlling nation state or corporate to wield power
    and influence over its users. Just consider, that some 10% of all global trade
    is conducted by the USA, yet 50% of all global trade is denominated in the US
    dollar currency. It is this reliance on the dollar as a global standard which
    affords the US greater economic and political power since its domestic monetary
    policy controlled by Government and The Fed will have disproportionate far reaching
    consequences beyond its borders. The potential therefore exists for an individual
    to therefore tokenise, or essentially securitise, themselves in order to take
    this power away from nation states for their own benefit; the *securitised self*.

    have all issued their own bespoke currencies, in themselves, raises many questions
    of functionality, taxation and legislation to name but a few. Nonetheless, this
    recognition and trend is already starting today as increasingly small nations
    begin to explore introducing their own state backed Central Bank Digital Currencys
    (CBCDs) to run in parallel with their existing adoption of invariably the US dollar.
    One such example is that of the Marshall Islands who in 2018 passed The Sovereign
    Currency Act outlining their intention to issue the Marshall Sovereign digital
    currency based upon blockchain technology and with a fixed supply. The Honourable
    David Paul – Minister In-Assistance to the President and Environment of the Marshall
    Islands – explained in 2019 that, ‘they (The Marshall Islands) wanted to be connected
    to the global financial system on their own terms’ and that ‘centralized solutions
    (of money) are not workable in a country of a little over 50,000 people spread
    across over 1,000 Pacific islands. This can be compared to Congressman Brad Sherman
    who in May 2019 said that

    one comparatively. It is therefore in its own gift to mint its own currency, and
    therefore it could be argued that as a unit of geographic scale this provision
    can go no further. You would be wrong to think so. City and regional level currencies
    exist the world over. Here in the UK by example, we have: The Bristol Pound, The
    Lake District Pound and the Liverpool Pound. In fact, many such examples exist
    the world over, including but not limited to: Calgary Dollars in Alberta, Equality
    Dollars in Philadelphia, the Tumin currency in Espinal in Mexico, the TEMs currency
    in Volos in Greece and Ithaca Hours currency in New York. This fragmentation of
    currency presents problems of standardisation and therefore utility to the user
    as currency is an instrument for whom the benefits scale. However, for the worker
    of tomorrow, their time is their own and therefore in a future world where their
    monetary worth can be measured and traded in secondary markets via DLEXs what
    is to stop their respective units of time from being tokenised?'

    towards the *securitised self* will be banding of uniform labour units. As previously
    discussed, this standardisation of labour is essential for the pragmatic pricing
    and operation of exchanges, and corresponding derivatives where such things may
    one day be traded.

    view* as the management consultants would say. Thus far, we have defined many
    different forms of future money which have broadly wrapped under the umbrella
    title of *cryptocurrencies*. They are as follows and are depicted over the page
    as part of the continuing story of the evolution of money ([Fig. 2](#fig2)).

    forward looking. The future of money is split into four ways between: (1) decentralised
    cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin; (2) Corporate-issued non-sovereign currencies
    such as Facebook’s Libra; (3) the securitised self – a hypothesised tokenisation
    of professional labour time; and (4) CBDCs – central bank-issued digital currencies,
    for example, the crypto pound. The latter again is a theoretical construct rather
    than a present reality. This chapter aimed to evaluate the future of money and
    to whom the gains of monetary policy control would accrue. The four scenarios
    shown above are not mutually exclusive and in truth it is a difficult call to
    make in quarter four 2019\. For Bitcoin and the other permissionless *alt coins*,
    we have seen a potential bubble then subsequent decline, but these currencies
    have yet to dissipate and the reluctance to depart from the plausible future is
    noted. Alternatively, the corporate-issued non-sovereign coins attract perhaps
    the most media and political attention, not least in part due to Facebook’s Libra.
    It should however be noted that JP Morgan’s institutional currency is effectively
    the institutional equivalent to Libra’s offering to the retail market. A more
    palatable offering that arguably flies under the radar. In contrast, the securitised
    self is perhaps the furthest from our present reality. A technological possibility
    which is consistent with the alignment of the current trend for increasingly short
    units of time for worker tasks. A concept which we have termed the *Bit task*.
    Finally, CBDCs represent the institutional repost to the threat of cryptocurrencies
    such as Bitcoin. Most central banks globally are exploring the mechanics of how
    such a currency would integrate into the current international economic systems.
    It is the opinion of these writers that corporates are unlikely to miss this opportunity
    without a fight. We as global consumers spend directly with corporates rather
    than governments. The latter tends to be indirect spending via taxation. For this
    reason, on balance, it is perhaps the corporates who will steal the day and therefore
    the spoils of what may become the next phase of globalisation. The ability to
    sell goods and services to consumers along with the monetary system which is used
    to purchase them. Central bank beware!'
