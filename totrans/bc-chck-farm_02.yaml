    produced by Sanlu, a dairy company. The formula had been mixed with melamine.
    Melamine is similar in appearance to milk and boosts protein content. Often used
    in cattle feed, it is toxic to humans above certain doses. In order to increase
    profits and yield, farmers producing dairy for Sanlu had added melamine to their
    milk. The amount of melamine in Sanlu’s infant formula exceeded the United Nations’
    food standard threshold for melamine in infant formula, with lethal results.

    expert John Yasuda on the phone. He’s in Oxford, England, and I’m standing on
    the second floor of the Shanghai Hongqiao train station, huddled in a McDonald’s,
    one of the few quiet spots in the sprawling building. “Food safety is a nasty
    problem that combines macro-political, economic questions into a problem that
    is lived out day-to-day,” John tells me. The more we talk, the more insurmountable
    food safety seems to become, given the interconnected, global span of the issue—a
    “wicked problem,” a new type of problem whose name Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber
    coined to describe the increasingly entangled, global nature of related challenges.

    on a country’s governance. For a long time, China’s food woes were exacerbated
    by political corruption and bribery. In 2013, Xi Jinping made it a priority to
    address agriculture and food safety in China, remarking, “If our party can’t even
    handle food-safety issues properly, then people will ask whether we are fit to
    keep ruling China.”

    authority. Compared to countries like Mexico and Turkey, which have similar GDPs

    food-safety score is shockingly low.

- en: Why is China so bad at food safety? John elaborates on the problems of scale
    that Matilda mentioned. Feeding 22 percent of the world’s population on 7 percent
    of the world’s arable land is just plain difficult. Complicating this task are
    the demands on China’s smallholder farmers. Nearly 98 percent of Chinese farmers
    have land that is less than the size of two football fields. There is enormous
    pressure on these farmers to produce enough food for the nation, ensuring food
    security. “The food bowl of the Chinese people must always remain firmly in their
    own hands,”^([2](notes-ch2.xhtml#notes-ch2-2)) remarked Xi Jinping during his
    first few months as president in 2013\. These farmers have additional pressure
    to produce enough food for export, which comprises 10 percent of China’s massive
    GDP, alongside humanitarian relief food, crucial to China’s bid as a global leader.
    And despite the amount of control the national government appears to have, the
    governance of food safety in China is fairly decentralized, with the bulk of the
    responsibility on province- and county-level agricultural bureaus.
  prefs: []

    industrialized agriculture would only displace farmers. As John points out, land
    in China is a precious resource, especially as China urbanizes and threatens the
    red line, an agricultural “defense line.” Most of all, the land allocated to farmers
    serves as a basic form of poverty alleviation—no matter how poor you are, you
    can always go back to the land and farm food for yourself and your family. Privatizing
    land would only reproduce social inequality, John says, and that would threaten
    political stability.

    “social trust can’t scale.” When supply chains were shorter, being able to meet
    your farmer created this trust. With supply chains now long and complex, the chance
    you might meet the Australian farmer who grew the kiwi you eat or the Mexican
    farmer who produced the avocado on your plate is low. Farmers themselves are also
    isolated from seeing the people they provide food for; they send their products
    off to larger corporations that then redistribute them. These corporations demand
    low prices, squeezing farmers into a bind. In the case of Sanlu’s melamine scandal,
    farmers felt the pressure from Sanlu to stretch their product to the point where
    it became lethal. This pressure to keep prices low increases with scale: the difference
    of a penny means a lot more when it’s multiplied by millions of gallons of milk.'
