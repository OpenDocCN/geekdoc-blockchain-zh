    a city had a McDonald’s, an approximation of the “tiered city” system. Throughout
    China, the tiered city system is like an economic badge, calculated by a mystical
    formula that takes in the city’s contribution to GDP, average monthly incomes,
    and housing prices. First-tier cities include Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai,
    places that have dozens of McDonald’s restaurants scattered throughout. Third-tier
    cities like Zhenjiang are much smaller, with maybe only one or two McDonald’s
    restaurants alongside a slew of knockoffs.

- en: Food safety is crucial for political stability, and is ultimately a reflection
    on a country’s governance. For a long time, China’s food woes were exacerbated

    that Matilda mentioned. Feeding 22 percent of the world’s population on 7 percent
    of the world’s arable land is just plain difficult. Complicating this task are
    the demands on China’s smallholder farmers. Nearly 98 percent of Chinese farmers
    have land that is less than the size of two football fields. There is enormous
    pressure on these farmers to produce enough food for the nation, ensuring food
    security. “The food bowl of the Chinese people must always remain firmly in their
    own hands,”^([2](notes-ch2.xhtml#notes-ch2-2)) remarked Xi Jinping during his
    first few months as president in 2013\. These farmers have additional pressure
    to produce enough food for export, which comprises 10 percent of China’s massive
    GDP, alongside humanitarian relief food, crucial to China’s bid as a global leader.
    And despite the amount of control the national government appears to have, the
    governance of food safety in China is fairly decentralized, with the bulk of the
    responsibility on province- and county-level agricultural bureaus.

  zh: 为什么中国在食品安全方面表现如此糟糕？约翰详细阐述了玛蒂尔达提到的规模问题。在全球可耕种土地的7%上养活22%的世界人口是极具挑战性的任务。中国的小农户农民面临的要求更使任务变得复杂。近98%的中国农民拥有不到两个足球场大小的土地。这些农民承受着巨大的压力，需要为国家生产足够的粮食，确保粮食安全。“中国人民的饭碗必须始终牢牢掌握在自己的手中”，习近平在2013年初担任主席时如此说道。这些农民还面临额外的压力，需要为出口生产足够的粮食，这占据了中国庞大GDP的10%，以及为人道主义援助食品提供保障，这对中国作为全球领导者的地位至关重要。尽管国家政府似乎拥有大量的控制权，但中国食品安全的治理在相当程度上是分散的，主要责任在于省和县级农业局。
- en: Although centralization and consolidation seem like they might be the answer,
    industrialized agriculture would only displace farmers. As John points out, land
    in China is a precious resource, especially as China urbanizes and threatens the
    red line, an agricultural “defense line.” Most of all, the land allocated to farmers
    serves as a basic form of poverty alleviation—no matter how poor you are, you
    can always go back to the land and farm food for yourself and your family. Privatizing
    land would only reproduce social inequality, John says, and that would threaten
    political stability.

  zh: 尽管中央集权和合并似乎是解决问题的答案，但工业化农业只会让农民流离失所。正如约翰指出的那样，中国的土地是一种宝贵资源，特别是在中国城市化并威胁到红线——一个农业“防线”的情况下。最重要的是，分配给农民的土地是一种基本形式的扶贫——无论你有多贫困，你总是可以回到土地上种植食物供给自己和家人。约翰表示，土地私有化只会再生产社会不平等，这将威胁到政治稳定。
- en: 'Ultimately, food safety revolves around social trust, and John thinks that
    “social trust can’t scale.” When supply chains were shorter, being able to meet
    your farmer created this trust. With supply chains now long and complex, the chance
    you might meet the Australian farmer who grew the kiwi you eat or the Mexican
    farmer who produced the avocado on your plate is low. Farmers themselves are also
    isolated from seeing the people they provide food for; they send their products
    off to larger corporations that then redistribute them. These corporations demand
    low prices, squeezing farmers into a bind. In the case of Sanlu’s melamine scandal,
    farmers felt the pressure from Sanlu to stretch their product to the point where
    it became lethal. This pressure to keep prices low increases with scale: the difference
    of a penny means a lot more when it’s multiplied by millions of gallons of milk.'

  zh: 最终，食品安全围绕着社会信任。约翰认为“社会信任无法扩展”。当供应链变得更短时，能够与农民见面创造了这种信任。但现在供应链又长又复杂，你可能几乎不可能遇到种植你享用的猕猴桃的澳洲农民或者产出你盘子里鳄梨的墨西哥农民。农民们也无法看到为他们提供食物的人；他们把产品送往更大的公司，然后再重新分配。这些公司要求低价，把农民逼到了一种困境。在三鹿假奶事件中，农民感受到了三鹿公司为拉长产品寿命给他们施加的压力，直到产品变得致命。随着规模扩大，低价压力增加：一分钱的差别在成百上千万加仑的牛奶中就意味着更多。

    within its realm of power, and under an economic system that thrives off inequality
    in creating a market, of course blockchain is here to stay. It creates another
    layer of inequality, another incentive to make food a commodity.

  zh: 有人对区块链和加密是否会长存存存在争议，技术是否真的能够做到所说的一切。我想到了三聚氰胺奶粉丑闻，以及区块链是否在那种情况下有帮助。污染来自农民，受经济压力驱使。区块链无法防止伪造，但会让奶更昂贵。在专制主义和经济体系下，专制主义受益于在其权力范围内掌握专业知识，而经济体系则通过不平等创造市场繁荣，那当然区块链会长存存存在。它创造了另一层不平等，又一种使食品成为商品的刺激。
- en: That is the intrinsic flaw, the infuriating circular logic. We operate under
    game theory conditions, under market forces, under the belief that we *will* lie
    to each other because someone else has more, and we have more to gain. And so
    we create solutions that further exacerbate this inequality. This is what happens
    when resources like food are treated as commodities to be bought and sold, to
    make money from, instead of as a basic human right.

  zh: 这就是固有的缺陷，让人恼火的循环逻辑。我们在博弈论条件下运行，在市场力量下运行，在这样的信念下*我们会*互相欺骗，因为他人拥有更多，我们可以获得更多。因此，我们创造出进一步加剧这种不平等的解决方案。这就是当食品等资源被视为可以买卖、从中赚钱的商品，而不是基本人权时会发生的事情。
- en: In some of the projects being discussed in rooms at the Decentralized Web Summit,
    the utopian language makes me cringe. Other projects give me significantly more
    hope. A decentralized web does not necessarily mean blockchain; it can include
    other tools that promote shared, community management in a legible way. These
    projects, many of which are alternatives to blockchain, feel exciting, almost
    utopian.

  zh: 在分散式网络峰会的一些讨论项目中，空谈乌托邦的语言让我感到不舒服。其他项目给了我更多的希望。分散式网络不一定意味着区块链；它可以包括其他促进共享、社区管理的工具以清晰的方式。这些项目，其中许多都是区块链的替代方案，感觉令人兴奋，几乎乌托邦。
- en: The truth is, we all want some kind of utopia, even if utopia is, by definition,
    not a place. We want a way for things to get better, to get perfect. What many
    of us are feeling right now, what we see, is that the existing economic systems
    don’t serve us.

  zh: 事实是，我们都希望有某种乌托邦，即使乌托邦根据定义不是一个地方。我们希望事情变得更好，变得完美。我们现在许多人感受到的是，现有的经济体系不为我们所用。
- en: As I run into friends at the conference and we discuss the talks we’ve attended,
    I know that I too want things to get better, and that I hold hope for technology
    to help us fix things—I remain, in some ways, an unabashed techno-optimist.

  zh: 当我在会议上碰到朋友，我们讨论我们参加的演讲时，我知道我也希望事情能变得更好，我对技术帮助我们解决问题抱有希望——在某种程度上，我仍然是一个不隐瞒技术乐观主义者。
- en: During lunch, I sit in a sunlit room, eating a chicken sandwich. This is where
    my travels get weird. For all our models of what will happen in a decentralized
    age, for all our incredible new technologies, we still cling to fictions about
    human nature. We have sequenced the human genome and we believe that humans can
    evolve, become ever more advanced. Yet, instead of designing technology that fosters
    and cultivates communal behaviors of trust, we still design technology that assumes
    scarcity and cultivates selfishness. This coercive design relies on a view of
    human nature that comes from a Hobbesian era when people barely had running water,
    a fictional, universal view of humanity that has been disproved over and over
    by research.

  zh: 在午餐时，我坐在一个阳光明媚的房间里吃鸡肉三明治。我的旅行如此奇特。尽管我们在去中心化时代发生了什么的各种模型，尽管我们有了令人难以置信的新技术，我们依然固守着有关人类本性的虚构。我们已经对人类基因组进行了序列，我们相信人类可以进化，变得越来越先进。然而，我们并没有设计出能促进和培养信任的团结行为的技术，而是依然设计出基于稀缺性和自私自利的技术。这种强制性的设计依赖于一个来自霍布斯时代的人类本性观点，那时人们几乎没有自来水，一个已经被研究一次又一次证明是虚构的、普遍的人类观。
- en: 'I think back to a different lunch, to my lunch with Ren before I visited the
    blockchain chicken farm. It was, ironically, a vegetarian meal at a small restaurant
    in the village. A large digital clock with the printed words COMPUTER ETERNITY
    TIME hung above us, red LCD numbers changing every minute as if it were showing
    an inevitable count toward fictional progress. I wonder: Who must agree to live
    in fictions that someone else wrote, and who has the power to write fictions for
    the rest of us? And if anyone can write fictions, why can’t we write new ones?'

  zh: 我想起另一次午餐，是在我参观区块链鸡场之前和仁共进午餐的时候。讽刺的是，我们当时在村里的一家小餐馆吃的是素食。我们头顶挂着一个大数字时钟，上面印着“计算机永恒时间”，红色LCD数字每分钟都在变化，仿佛在显示着一个不可避免的虚构进程。我在想：是谁必须同意生活在别人编写的虚构中，以及谁有权利为我们其他人编写虚构？如果任何人都能编写虚构，为什么我们不能创造新的虚构呢？
