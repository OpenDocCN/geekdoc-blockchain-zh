    sites with names such as Centrebet and Bodog. But Reuters’ analysis of early bitcoin
    software provided by Wright indicates that “bitcoin grew out of code originally
    developed with online poker in mind.” His prime credit before bitcoin was probably
    Lasseter’s Online, arguably the first Internet casino, and profitable until the

    security forensics and the purported co-coder of bitcoin, the putative Satoshi

    a digital exchange called Liberty Reserve in Costa Rica. Kleiman thought their

    the federal prosecutor in New York and scourge of insider trading, thought Liberty
    should be shut down as a money-laundering operation under the Patriot Act because
    many of its twelve million annual transactions were apparently conducted by criminals.
    Bharara doesn’t kid around. Liberty’s management went to jail for twenty years.

    may not be able to collect even this money. After he reportedly showed his Aussie

    Ayre, an early draft of the Satoshi white paper in 2008, Ayre decided to back
