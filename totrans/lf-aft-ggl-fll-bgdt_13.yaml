    a digital exchange called Liberty Reserve in Costa Rica. Kleiman thought their
    half-share was worth $28 million, or $14 million for Wright. But Preet Bharara,
    the federal prosecutor in New York and scourge of insider trading, thought Liberty
    should be shut down as a money-laundering operation under the Patriot Act because
    many of its twelve million annual transactions were apparently conducted by criminals.

    the Tulip trustee, Uyen Nguyen, told me so in 2015 at my Telecosm-MoneyShow conference

    bypass lawyers and accountants. But to implement such contracts a computer platform
    must be fully programmable as a “Turing machine.” With an abstruse discourse on
    the properties of the Forth programming language, Wright attempts to show that
    bitcoin is as Turing-complete as any other platform. Szabo curtly disputes that

    secure haven accessible through the Internet. Traditionally the haven currency
    was the U.S. dollar, but since early 2018—from Greece to Venezuela, from Argentina
    to Zimbabwe—the haven has increasingly been bitcoin.

- en: The dominant monetary standard and haven currency through much of human history
    has been gold. With a total financial market of some $2.4 trillion, gold still
    dwarfs bitcoin at $128 billion. The supply of gold has grown by an average of
    2 percent per year for centuries, giving it a less remorseless deflationary bias—an
    advantage over bitcoin, the supply of which is capped at twenty-one million units
    in 2140, 80 percent of which had already been “mined” by 2018\. As a unit of account
    and store of value, two of the key facets of money, gold is the ultimate standard.

    a global alternative to fiat currencies during a historical period when these
    moneys are vulnerable to the depredations of the world’s governments, now indebted
    to the unsustainable level of $280 trillion. With the value crunch for bitcoin
    still decades away, moderate deflation seems attractive compared to runaway devaluations.

- en: This bitcoin path is portentous. The blockchain investment strategists Chris
    Burniske and Jack Tatar calculate that if bitcoin merely takes 10 percent of the
    market currently held by financial gold, the bitcoin price will have to rise above
    eleven thousand dollars.[⁶](notes.html#ch13note-6) It passed this mark in November
    2017 and kept moving up toward twenty thousand as part of a total crypto-currency
    market cap that exceeded half a trillion dollars in early 2018\. Then it corrected
    back to six thousand. But it is behaving like an asset that will retain value.

    and useful. If bitcoin takes much of the $600 billion market for remittances,
    which seems equally plausible, its price would have to rise by another five thousand
    dollars or so. If it can capture a substantial portion of the market for international
    business-to-business transactions—volatile and freighted with fees and friction
    and foreign-exchange tolls—all bets are off. The B2B market is $40 trillion.

    Turing-complete chain within bounds, he could also compete with bitcoin in these
    markets. But his path is long and winding and uncertain.

- en: 'The redoubtable blockchain scholar and evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos contends
    that this rivalry may turn out to be largely spurious. In a dramatic image, he
    compares bitcoin and Ethereum to “a lion and a shark.” Each will dominate in its
    own domain. Each will suffer from limitations and tradeoffs. The lion must forgo
    opportunities in the 70 percent of the planet covered with water: liquid currency.
    The shark has to give up markets on dry land. The outcome might depend on whether
    the land is faced with flooding.'
