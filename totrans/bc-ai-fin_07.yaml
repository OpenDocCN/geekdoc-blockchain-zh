    artificial intelligence will invariably lead to anxiety, stress, and potentially
    misunderstanding of just what these technologies represent for financial services.
    Blockchain, hopefully, at this point has been demystified to a certain extent,
    but the idea of artificial intelligence may appear and seem like a more amorphous
    concept that is both difficult to understand but potentially disruptive in nature.
    While artificial intelligence has been featured in numerous media outlets, movies,
    and T.V. shows, the image that is most often presented to audiences and market
    actors is one that, almost invariably, has negative connotations and implications
    for the developers and users. Fortunately, while there have been numerous advances
    in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence, the limits of
    current iterations are still substantial. In other words there is no need to fear
    the Terminator coming for financial practitioner roles. Prior to diving into what
    the applications and implications of AI may very well be, however, it seems appropriate
    to first put forward a definition that makes sense in the context of this discussion.
    Not meant to be overly technical, but rather a working definition to assist financial
    professionals seeking to understand and explain the implications of AI, a working
    definition as follows is a workable option:'

    coverage but has subsequently received less coverage and analysis recently due
    to the somewhat amorphous nature of the idea itself (Lee [2018](#CR7)). Blockchain
    and cryptocurrency may also be difficult to understand and appear to be a relatively
    new concept in and of itself, but even in spite of this initial confusion and
    analysis there are similarities between these technology tools and preexisting
    options. A decentralized ledger system, otherwise labeled as a decentralized ledger
    technology (DLT) platform is, of course, different from current centralized options,
    but underlying components can be related to tools like Excel and Access. Additionally,
    cryptocurrencies are simply a representation of how several technology tools and
    aspects have been combined, namely the tools of encryption, peer-to-peer processing
    ability, and various components of consensus data verification are not, by themselves,
    innovative or unique.

    intelligence can appear to be murky and lacking a relation to current technology
    or processes. Also, especially for financial services professionals, the challenges
    and threats of automation, digitization, and increased efficiency do have the
    potential to displace and disrupt core functions of what financial professionals
    actually perform. It is true that automation and digitization are not new issues
    and trends in the accounting and financial fields, but these do seem to be accelerating
    as well as mirroring events that have already occurred in other industry sectors
    (Mehendale [2018](#CR8)). Examples abound in the marketplace, including a recently
    highlighted example of how J.P. Morgan is leveraging artificial intelligence tools
    to improve the speed and efficiency with which contracts and other paperwork are
    reviewed and analyzed. This example, however, is only one example of how artificial
    intelligence is being used in the marketplace, not even drilling down into the
    work underway at IBM.

    and are being used by a variety of organizations, many times in ways that are
    not initially apparent. Organizations ranging from Tesla, to Uber, which may appear
    to be more likely fit for technological integration, and even organizations like
    Kohl’s and McDonalds – more traditionally thought of firms – are already using
    different types of AI in the marketplace (Garbuio and Lin [2019](#CR4)). GPS systems,
    voice activated assistants like Siri or Alexa, Roombas that are already cleaning
    rooms, and the self driving cars that dominate the headlines all use different
    forms of AI. The point that is hopefully becoming increasingly clear is that artificial
    intelligence is something already widespread within the marketplace, and that
    financial professionals must be able to adapt and evolve alongside the rest of
    the marketplace.

    services professionals, and what are some of the impacts this technology could

    AI  because that is type of AI most professionals are going to (1) be familiar
    with, and (2) think of when they think of AI in the workplace. Increasing the
    speed with which information can be processed requires ever increasing amounts
    of computing power, and as more and more streams of information are available
    for decision making purposes, it stands to reason that financial services will
    be no exception to the technology tidal wave. Quantitative brokerage houses are
    already using computational AI  to improve performance, and virtually every business
    has integrated some sort of advanced processing or computing capability into their
    operations.

    types of non-accounting or non-financial work and services, but actually the importance
    of being able to analyze words and phrases, and then translate these items into
    business actions cannot be overstated. Whether it is used in terms of trading
    and/or investing in certain securities driven by headline news items or by organizations
    seeking to get a better handle on what certain phrases mean in a footnote or other
    type of disclosure, the ability to analyze in and use data like this is critical
    for financial services professionals.

    the rise of spatial AI  will certainly have an impact on the organizations serviced

    be important for financial services professionals to understand what this terminology

    role moving forward than is previously occupied. Specifically, the combination
    and integration of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other automation tools
    appears positioned to drive change and innovation throughout the business landscape.
    Combining these technologies allows practitioners and organizations to tap into
    and unlock the potential upside of these different tools, both from a financial

    intelligence may not even by linked directly to the technologies themselves, but
    rather the business opportunities that these tools will generate. While not specifically
    related to the functional work done by financial services professionals, these
    are definitely items that should form the basis of advisory conversations. Stated
    another way, in order for financial professionals to actually become strategic
    partners they must be aware of the potential applications of these tools outside
    of the traditional financial services landscape (Preimesberger [2019](#CR9)).
    For example, a common thread that runs through the implementation conversations
    surrounding both artificial intelligence and blockchain technology is the need
    for electricity both of these tools require. Even with more efficient and platforms
    being developed and implemented in the marketplace, the power and energy requirements
    of increased technology integration does not appear to be fading.

    increased power demands, there is also a specific subset of business opportunities
    that revolve around this increased demand. Drilling down there is one potential
    business opportunity that must be taken into account; the increased demand for
    commercial real estate associated with providing the power for such technologies
    will only continue to increase. Whether this means the repurposing of currently
    unoccupied commercial property, the building of new facilities and locations to
    supply this power, or the investment within real estate sector of the organization,
    the trend toward reallocating resources will be a definitive byproduct of the
    growing integration of technology throughout business processes. Being aware of
    these opportunities and implications, however, is just the first step in this
    advisory process. In order to truly evolve and develop into strategic business
    partners, financial professionals must also be able to weave these possibilities
    and opportunities into current business operations.

    with blockchain technology represents a potential game changing combination of
    how data is treated, compiled and reported. While it may seem logical to examine
    the fact that some organizations are already making fantastic use of data and

    and evolve from a role as steward of capital assets or compliance based practitioner
    to one of a strategic business partner. That said, in order to actually develop
    and evolve along these lines it is important for all professionals to at least
    have a basic understanding of what needs and expectations clients will have moving
    forward. Simply being aware, and understanding the working definitions of technology
    tools is not enough; practitioners must also be able to connect the proverbial
    dots. Each of these emerging technologies, from blockchain to artificial intelligence,
    to cryptocurrency adoption are substantive enough in their own right, but when
    combined and merged with each other, can truly represent a game changer for both
    technology and business at large (Anand [2019](#CR1)). Taking a look, prior to

    quite a widespread impact on the broader business environment, there are also
    going to be implications and applications specific to the financial services industry.
    Namely, and accelerating trends and forces already present in the financial landscape,
    namely the forces of automation and digitization, artificial intelligence can
    be thought of as adding fuel to the proverbial fire, including the ability of
    machines and program to continuously learn and evolve (Heaton et al. [2017](#CR6)).
    This acceleration of existing forces, however, can cause equal parts negative
    and positive impacts in the marketplace, especially as it pertains to the accounting
    and finance functions. Namely, and an important point to remember that, no matter
    how sophisticated the technology or AI tool actually is, if the underlying process
    is poorly designed and executed simply introducing a new technology platform will
    not improve anything.

    on accounting, attestation, financial advising, investing, and other aspects of
    the financial services fields it seems appropriate to begin our analysis in the
    areas most likely, and which already are, feeling the impact of AI. Financial
    advising, financial planning, and charting an investment strategy to contend with
    different market forces have traditionally remained in the realm of individuals
    and human advisors, but there is one fundamental issue with this approach continuing
    in the current marketplace. Drilling down, the sheer volume of information and
    data that is produced and generated by both organizations and the broader market
    dovetail exactly with the attributes of artificial intelligence. Analyzing large
    amounts of information, gleaning patterns and insights from quantitative information,
    and creating outputs and results as a result of these analyses link directly to
    what investment professionals are paid to do. Digesting market information, interpreting
    market trends and forces, and translating the bigger picture into investment advice
    and insights already are being augmented by AI tools. Put simply, robo-advisors
    and automated wealth planning organizations already exist and will only become
    more important going forward (Decarlo [2018](#CR3)).

    to become programming or coding experts in order to thrive in an AI-driven environment
    in the future. That is actually far from the truth; much like practitioners do
    not need to know how to code in C++ or understand the technical specifications
    of how an upload process works, it is unlikely financial services practitioners
    will be expected to be AI experts. Rather, and similar to how computing became
    more powerful once graphical user interfaces become more widespread, it seems
    reasonable to forecast that AI will become more mainstream once the interface
    and user functionality becomes more sophisticated. Even though the technical aspects
    of AI will increasingly become built into different platforms and protocols, it
    seems that the majority of this functionality will on the back end versus forcing

    to note the following. Virtually every existing accounting software provider is

- en: First, possibly the most obvious place where artificial intelligence can, and
    already is, driving change and innovation in the accounting profession is in the
    auditing  and attestation areas of the profession. Traditional auditing  relies
    on a combination of periodic quantitative examination, qualitative conversations
    and dialogue with members of the organization and stakeholder groups, and additional
    analytical procedures to help answer additional questions arising during the process.
    While this model and process for auditing organizations has served numerous organizations,
    firms, and practitioners very well, there are substantial flaws that have been
    exploited time and again. The time lag, a primary points of concern, between when
    the information being audited was actually generated and when the data is tested
    presents the following problem; if errors or omissions are present in the information
    it may be months before they are uncovered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time delays and lags in between the production of information and the reviewing
    and attestation of this data by external experts is a significant issue in both
    the attestation process itself, and as it relates to market efficiency. The theory
    of efficient markets, i.e. that no one investor or group has access to private
    information on a continuous basis, is dependent on the information being distributed
    on an equivalent basis in terms of the time factor. At the current time, the diffusion
    of information is dependent on traditional technologies that are relatively well
    established in the marketplace, but AI has the potential redefine many of these
    pre-existing terms and practices.

    of blockchain technology, can be truly be realized. Each technology tool by itself
    will invariably drive change and impact the profession as a whole, but when combined
    with the immutability and real time communication of data possible with blockchain
    it is increasingly clear that core functions of how accounting work will change
    over time. For example, if certain classes of information and data have been secured
    and recorded on a blockchain, and been approved by network members, AI tools can
    be leveraged to analyze these continuously increasing quantities of information,
    enabling the tools to augment rather than supplant human participants (Briggs
    [2019](#CR2)). Since information stored on a blockchain has already been approved,
    encrypted, and communicated between involved parties – and in a private blockchain
    environment this can include auditors and audit firms relatively simply – analysis
    and reporting can occur on a continuous basis rather than only a periodic basis.
    In addition to the continuous potential that is delivered by technology this also
    allows the catching and resolution of errors before they become material or threaten
    the organization in nature.

    must be contended within virtually every organization, artificial intelligence
    represents the possibility that information can be tracked in near real time.
    Traditional auditing relies on a small sample if information to be analyzed and
    then serve as the basis for generating the entire audit opinion, but this clearly
    opens the door to a number of sampling errors. Although methods and protocols
    to prevent these different classes of errors are routinely covered both in university
    education and continuing education these errors continue to occur. One merely
    need to look at various business headlines to see that audit failures occur on
    a routine basis; leveraging AI to more efficiently process, analyze, and report
    the ever increased amounts of information can help reduce the risk of these different
    types of errors and failures. Clearly it will be necessary for individuals to
    supervise the implementation and operations of AI tools at the organization in
    question, but by partnering and leveraging the variety of AI tools and options
    available CPAs and other accounting professionals can make more efficient use
    of their time and efforts.

    and assurance services that are currently offered to the marketplace by both individual
    practitioners and firms itself is the potential impact that AI will have on the
    work done by audit and attestation professionals  . Especially when stacked or
    merged with technologies such as automation, robotic process automation, and ultimately
    blockchain implementation, the implications of AI can be profound. For example,
    if pieces of information and data have been approved and verified by other members
    network, and be unassigned an unalterable hash ID, this creates a ready made audit
    trail. In and of itself this is a potential game changer, but when taken in the
    context of the increasing utilization of AI tools and other bots, it really does
    represent an entirely new way of how audits are performed. If this permanent trail
    of information and data can, in addition to be manually examined and checked,
    can additional be examined and analyzed by the various AI tools put into place

    law, policy, and realities actually impact an organization. Taking aside the political
    forces that invariably impact tax policy and the policy making process, at the

    roles. Analyzing large amounts of information, uncovering and addressing any errors

    of time wasted doing this redundant and time consuming work, every individual

    on almost every organization; the need for continued education and training for
    both financial services professionals and other professionals. Despite the buzz
    and hype surrounding AI, and even taking into the rapid advancements and integration
    that AI has already had, it is commonly stated agreed upon that were are merely
    in the first stages of this paradigm shift. Certifications and training are still
    being developed due to the nascent nature of the technology itself, but that is
    no reason for professionals and organizations to not start developing programs
    and education initiatives. Specifically, a core segment of any training and education
    should, in addition to drilling down into the technical aspects of artificial
    intelligence tools, the development of other business skills is an absolute necessity.

- en: Outside of the technical aspects of how artificial intelligence will drive change
    in the profession, of which there are many, it is also important to recognize
    the reality that AI integration will have a dramatic shift on the type of professionals
    needed in the finance space. Continuing to simply be subject matter experts, or
    focus only on certain niche aspects of audit, tax, or finance will not be enough
    in a business landscape where AI tools, bots, and other automation software becomes
    more commonplace. Individuals working in the profession at this current state,
    as well as the individuals who continue to enter the profession are going to have
    to be aware of two salient facts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the idea of being – and remaining – a subject matter expert in areas
    of technical implementation of interpretation of certain accounting standards
    is going to become less possible. This is not to say it will remain impossible,
    but that it will be more difficult for humans to match the processing and interpretation
    ability of ever more powerful AI tools and platforms. Instead, and mirroring a
    trend that is already happening in the marketplace, practitioners working in the
    financial services landscape are going to have to be able to complement the speed
    and processing power of AI tools. For example, if an algorithm provides an answer,
    fact pattern, or trading suggestion, the practitioner is going to have to be able
    to (1) analyze that output to see if it matches the data inputs, (2) ascertain
    whether the recommended strategy is cost effective or appropriate given other
    considerations, and (3) interpret and present the recommendation to the end user
    in a way that is understandable. In order to provide any of these services, the
    practitioner will, of course, need to have an understanding of the technical fundamentals,
    but instead of relying exclusively on that, will also need to develop complementary
    skill sets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, and building on the first implications of AI on financial services,
    is that in order to provide consistent and high quality services to end users,
    a more holistic approach will be necessary. This does not mean, however, that
    the core of the services will stray from financial matters, just that in order
    to be effective it will require more input from a greater number of participants.
    As opposed to simply involving accounting or finance professionals in the decision
    making process, it seems logical that both information technology professionals
    and legal experts should also be included in this process. For example, if artificial
    intelligence programs and processes are going to be implemented throughout the
    organization, these programs need to be coded, programmed, tested, and debugged
    as they move from test to production environments; this points to the inclusion
    of technology experts. Additionally, as these different programs are implemented
    throughout the organization, the legal implications must also be assessed. For
    example, if an AI program is set to automate certain distributions of information
    or data, legal distributions of information should also be monitored.

    to the theme and implementation of AI tools, since every CEO and every organization
    states – almost without question – that leveraging data is core to the decision
    making process. That said, and a reality that virtually everyone who works in
    a business environment will agree to, is that a plurality of decisions are still
    driven by intuition, instinct, past track records, or a combination therein. In
    other words, even though there is more information available than ever before
    in the market, not every organization actually makes effective use of the data
    already available to them to. Not only is this tactic not efficient in terms of
    the investments made toward improving the quality of data generated by the firm,
    but also results in an inefficient use of managerial time. Put simply, if no one
    is looking at or using the information produced internally by the firm then what
    is the purpose of even generating the information is the first place? As more
    and more pieces and devices employed within the organization are connected to
    the Internet of Things, the volume of information produced will only continue
    to increase; AI can and will help organizations make sense of this information.

- en: The assistance that AI can deliver to organizations in terms of analyzing larger
    amounts of information, be it structured or unstructured in nature, also extends
    to the accounting and financial services areas. Let’s drill down specifically
    into two of the most common pain points associated with the work performed by
    accounting, audit, and attest professionals; confirmations and asset verifications.
    Namely, a core function of an audit consists of both confirming that certain amounts
    and valuations on the balance sheet actually exist, and that the values included
    on the balance sheet are indeed accurate. Currently this involves, almost without
    exception, a string of emails sent between the external audit firm, suppliers
    or customers of the client, and then a presentation of results delivered to the
    client. Clearly in the age of 24/7 information and the increased pace with which
    business occurs, relying on such a manual and time consuming process to confirm
    data does not appear appropriate. Additionally, verifying the physical existence
    of assets, namely inventory, is an important part of any entry level auditors
    training and on-the-job experience, but may not add much in the way of value to
    the organization. On top of the financial impact that having an accurate count
    of inventory generates, it is also an area where fraud and other unethical activity
    has occurred with frightening occurrence. Better control, more up-to-date information
    linked both to inventory and the ramifications of inventory levels will, invariably,
    create opportunities for more efficient deployment of capital.

    at the firm, also can help to augment current decision making processes that are,
    at least at the current moment, driven by various qualitative factors. When dealing
    with a global and digitized environment, complete with different streams of information
    coming into the organization, a rather obvious problem can become more pronounced.
    Every different technology system and platform, clearly, has data formatting protocols
    and systems that have been built around the needs of those individual users. This
    may make sense from a specific perspective, such for utilizing a unique system
    within an organization or arrangement of organizations, but when trying to transfer
    data between different firm or partner organizations this represents a substantial
    problem. Any professional who has ever spent time trying to manually format and
    reconcile different file types is well aware of the time and energy that is spent
    attempting to correct these issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to absorbing the time and mental energy of different employees this
    also increases the time spent making decisions, which can cost organizations potential
    opportunities. Manually reconciling files and format types when performing a bank
    reconciliation might only take a few minutes, but for larger organizations, or
    with firms interacting with global counterparties, these reconciliations can add
    hours or days to the processing of information. Artificial intelligence tools
    and processes, by automating or being trained to translate and automate the translation
    and standardization, can – and already are – adding speed and efficiency to how
    data is processes and communicated. On the flip side, however, as the speed with
    which data is processed and communicated continues to increase and accelerate,
    it becomes even more important to establish internal controls over how data is
    handled. Controls may seem like an afterthought in a business environment where
    the improvement of technology is the primary conversation topic, but that does
    not mean it should be overlooked. Much like dominos can be arranged so that one
    can initiate a much larger cascading series of events, if bad information is entered
    into an AI-augmented or AI-driven process the ramifications of this bad data can
    quickly escalate out of control.

    technological integration there will also be some roles and jobs that are eliminated
    as a result of automation. Circling back to the core functionalities of artificial
    intelligence, namely the increases of efficiency and speed with which data can
    be analyzed and transformed, there will be some job displacement and disruption
    in the marketplace. While it is important to, of course, recognize the benefits
    and upsides of AI, it is equally important to understand that these benefits and
    upsides will not come without associated downside risk. In order to acknowledge
    the potential risk and downsides of artificial intelligence, again it is important
    to recognize the reality that interdisciplinary teams will become more and more
    important. As organizations are better able to leverage technology tools and platforms
    to gain better insights into data, and do so with lower levels of headcount, professionals
    and organizations alike will need to think outside of the proverbial box.

    and to seek out new ways to deliver and connect value to the marketplace is not
    a new idea or concept, it is increasingly evident expected that organizations
    will be able to harness, report, and analyze data in a real time manner. One of
    the most important trends and concepts that is underway in the marketplace, however,
    is that even though technology continues to advance and become adopted across
    different industry lines, the financial services profession is – for lack for
    a better term – lagging in this regard. Practitioners across different industry
    lines and subsets will have to become more used to become technologically advanced
    rather than simply relying on existing tools and platforms to compete in an increasingly
    digitized environment.

    Netflix, and Tesla are employing artificial intelligence tools and platforms to
    generate more customized programming and better services, all of which assist
    with customer retention. A basic example of how AI might already be able to add
    value to your organization is simply by applying it to tasks that occur on a recurring
    basis such as emails, scheduling, and calendar management. This may not seem like
    the most riveting or exciting areas to focus on at first, but the reality is that
    achieving early wins, building momentum, and gaining increased buy-in from management
    are important steps for anyone, or any firm, looking to better integrate AI tools.
    Now, enough of talking in generalities about how AI might change finance and accounting
    services; let’s go through and take a look at some real examples that figure not
    only how AI might change how financial services function, but then apply them
    to work already being performed by practitioners.

    – in large part – rendered obsolete by technology playing a larger role in these
    processes, both accounting and finance professionals will need to be able to envision
    and evolve into new roles. At first glance this may seem like a continuation of
    automation processes already underway within the professional service s landscape,
    but instead represents an entirely new lens through which accounting and finance
    is viewed. Put simply, the proverbial game is changing in terms of what is expected
    of financial services professionals, and how this information is delivered to
    the end users of financial data and information.

    new; high speed trading and the dominance of algorithms in the markets is a trend
    that has been discussed, analyzed, and reported on at length. That said, and the
    key point to remember during this conversation is that, as computers become increasingly
    sophisticated there will also be drawbacks. As increasing amounts of trading are
    connected to computers, programs, and algorithms that operate without direct human
    oversight and intervention there is a possibility that large swings in the market
    (that volatility word) will become more frequent. Actually, and just gathered
    from anecdotal evidence and review of market commentary, it does seem that the
    increasing technological dominance of trading may be leading to several different
    effects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, while volatility while judged by historically levels, has been at low
    levels in the 2015–2018 time period this does not provide the entire picture.
    The decrease in volatility may not, as some has speculated, be associated with
    the increased efficiency generated by algorithmic trading programs, but rather
    a related trend. ETFs, passive investing tools, and the growing (trillions as
    of this writing) assets invested in these options may also be having an outsized
    impact on volatility and training patterns. Put simply, as larger and larger percentages
    of investors and funds are investing in similar, if not identical, trading tools
    and platforms, this may very well have a depressive impact on market volatility.
    This may very well seem like a positive effect to retail investors with jitters
    linked to increases in market volatility, but masks an underlying problem. If
    investing decisions are made outside of human oversight and supervision this can
    inadvertently lead to market selloffs, runoffs, and other actions that do not
    reflect the underlying economic reality.

    advisory focused finance professionals to offer real time, real world, and actionable
    business insights to clients and customers in a market that can seem as it operates
    outside the realm of normal possibility. Volatility, although depressed during
    2017, seems to have returned to the market with force in 2018, emphasizes the
    important of having a professional behind the wheel of various automated services
    and processes. Simply executing certain processes, trades, and business transactions
    faster will offer no benefit to either the organization or clients if those said
    processes are poorly written or designed. In order for practitioners to effectively
    leverage technology they must understand not only how the technology itself works,
    but also how it can – and should be – applied to the business decision making
    process itself.

    landscape is the realm of ad hoc and management reporting, which constitutes a
    rather large percentage of the actual work performed by professionals working
    in the space. Generating reports for management and supervisors simultaneously
    forms a plurality of work performed by many accounting professionals and a way
    that professionals can quantitatively add value to the organization. Despite of
    this, one of the key issues raised and problems associated with internal management
    reporting, or ad hoc reporting, is that data is not generated consistently, systems
    do not communicate with each other, and there are inevitably time lags between
    when different classes of information are generated. Even worse, in the context
    of accounting professionals seeking to elevate both themselves and the work performed
    internally, the amount of time spent correcting errors, manually adjusting entries
    and information deprives professionals of the time necessary to instead focus
    on higher level activities. In other words, if accountants are spending too much
    time manually creating reports and fixing errors, those same professionals will
    never be able to achieve the oft-cited role as strategic advisor or business partner.

    this text, represents a prime area where artificial intelligence will have an
    impact on the profession. Currently, the entire process of auditing has several
    pain points, namely the fact that the final audit opinion is heavily (if not exclusively)
    reliant on expanding on findings generated from a small sample of organizational
    information. Even with the subsequent analytical procedures and substantive tests
    added into the audit examination process, audit failures are all too common. AI
    tools, such as those represented by the partnership between IBM Watson and KPMG,
    are already having an dramatic impact on audit testing, procedures, and how auditors
    interact with both clients and future clients. This evolution and transition,
    from a compliance oriented function that focused exclusively on financial information,
    to a more comprehensive process that can operate on a continuous basis also connects
    to several other trends. Introduced here, but examined in more detail later in
    this book, the connection between assurance work, non-financial information, and
    the importance of this data to the decision making process opens up a proverbial
    work of opportunities for accounting practitioners.

    with pleasant news or something that management professionals, but that is not
    something that should be perceived as the final state of the conversation. Specifically,
    and even in the current environment beset by changes in tax reporting, this debate
    and analysis can, and should, be perceived both as an opportunity and part of
    the continuous management dialogue. Put simply, although the Tax Cuts and Jobs
    Acts was passed right at the end of 2017 – December 22nd to be specific – the
    ripple effects as a result of this legislation are still being analyzed and processed
    by both individuals and organizations. Processing the sheer number of changes,
    running scenario analyses, and putting the results of these analyses into a format
    and report that are understandable for management decision making is both a role
    accounting professionals should play, and a function enabled by AI tools. Taxes
    have an impact on the bottom line, will continue to guide investment and operational
    decisions moving forward, and will play a prominent role in the implementation
    and analysis of AI.

    often, but is also one of the most misunderstood ideas on the emerging technology
    spectrum; artificial intelligence. A key point for practitioners to understand
    is that, even if they themselves of their organizations are not particularly interested
    in using artificial intelligence for business purposes at this point in time is
    that clients and customers are potentially already doing so. Drilling down specifically
    to the topics covered in this text, practitioners need to be able to understand
    and communicate the reality that there are different classes of intelligence that
    may be applicable to different industry lines. To that end, this chapter also
    breaks down the different types of artificial intelligence that are available
    in the marketplace at this point in time. Clearly not an all-inclusive listing
    or analysis of the types of artificial intelligence that exist, the types of intelligence
    documented within this chapter should instead serve as an appropriate jumping
    off point for future conversations and analyses. Additionally, and applicable
    for all users and readers of this text and associated materials is the differentiation
    between AI, RPA, and other automation tools that are currently available and in
    use by practitioners. Understanding what artificial intelligence means from both
    a technical and application perspective will be important not only in the current
    marketplace but as well as the future as automation moves from emerging topics
    idea to mainstream business practice.
