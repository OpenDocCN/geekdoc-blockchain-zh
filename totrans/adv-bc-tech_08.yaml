    and comfortable driving (intelligent transportation systems). Current vehicles
    already have a set of modern technologies deployed. For instance, they can run
    various applications, use navigation systems, and connect to the Internet. The
    following purpose is achieving V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) [[1](#CR1)] and V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure)
    [[2](#CR2)] communications to enhance safety messages exchanged between road users

    which is an issue for the current Internet architecture based on the TCP/IP model.
    Therefore, research communities proposed to bring NDN (named data networking)
    to IoV (Internet of vehicles) to tackle those issues. NDN is a future Internet
    architecture that is based on named content rather than IP addresses. It uses
    a request/reply model which doesn’t need session establishment nor address allocation
    to exchange data.

    keys to encrypt and decrypt data in the network. The main idea is to secure the
    data itself rather than securing the medium of transmission. However, additional
    security concerns still exist in NDN and require further research [[4](#CR4)].
    Thus, we thought to bring the blockchain technology to NDN-based IoV, especially
    to overcome the cache poisoning attack that intends to propagate bogus content
    to the network’s nodes, and thereby to forward only safe content. Blockchain is
    a decentralized, distributed, and open ledger that saves transactions efficiently
    in a transparent and immutable way.

    called BIoVN (**b**lockchain for **I**nternet **o**f **v**ehicles over **N**DN).
    The proposed system aims to deliver, forward, and cache only safe content over
    the network. To the best of our knowledge, very few publications are available
    in the literature that discusses the IoV over NDN in terms of blockchain technology
    or addresses the security of the cached and forwarded content.

    in the BIoVN system. The principal aim of any algorithm is to discover the most
    outstanding couple between a collection of possible results and a goal model.
    This can be approached to discovering a fulfilling result in discrete search space
    over a reasonable execution time. Representing the problem in this manner makes
    it very much similar to the attitude of an optimization algorithm. Indeed, metaheuristics
    are considered repetitive actions that cleverly lead a subordinate heuristic to
    create excellent results by operating diversification and intensification methods
    in the space. Metaheuristics are approximate algorithms that exceed exact algorithms
    regarding the scope of the resolved problem. The capacity to deal with different
    difficulties using miniature variations usually comes from the nature inspiration.
    Using easy tools, different problems are resolved in nature, and a quality result
    is always found thanks to the attitude of living beings such as animals and insects.
    Therefore, we tried to discover an effective metaheuristic stimulated by the power
    of nature to resolve complicated problems and produce results with acceptable
    quality. Currently, we are in the phase of the simulation of the system. The major

    [[5](#CR5)], which is recognized as a significant field of study. Among instances
    of ICN, NDN is proposed as a promising future Internet architecture, and it is
    based mainly on the content (what to send) instead of the location (where to send).
    Named data packets are used rather than destination and source addresses used
    by the current TCP/IP architecture [[6](#CR6)]. While forwarding is done using
    IP address headers in IP-based routers, each packet name prefix is used by NDN-based
    routers to forward packets. This adoption of unique named contents allows nodes
    to memorize and control the state of each packet. NDN and the current Internet
    architecture have the same hourglass architecture except for some divergence in
    similar layers [[7](#CR7)]. The named content chunks constitute the principal
    blocks of NDN, while in TCP/IP, the basic unit of communication is a point-to-point
    channel between two nodes identified by IP addresses [[8](#CR8), [9](#CR9)].

- en: 'Two types of packets are engaged in NDN: interest and data [[10](#CR10)]. They
    are used, respectively, by consumers and producers while communicating. Since
    the NDN is recipient driven, consumers express their desire for a piece of data
    by putting its name in an interest packet and sending it to the network. Any node
    which retains a copy of the desired content will play the role of the producer
    and reply with a data packet. This packet will then take the reverse path to come
    back to the consumer [[11](#CR11)]. Each node maintains three databases [[12](#CR12)]
    used in the forwarding process: the CS (Content Store) stores copies of freshly
    forwarded data to supply future queries and increase content distribution. The
    PIT (pending interest table) keeps track of forwarded interest packets that are
    not yet satisfied. Incoming interfaces are saved in the PIT entries, so data packets
    can easily retrieve the correct path to reach original consumers. And the FIB
    (forwarding information base) records the important forwarding information like
    the prefix and the next hopes. This information is used to lead the interest packet
    to the potential providers.'

    example, the content “/parking/ Mimosas/P3” is desired by Consumer 1\. As the
    forwarder has this content in its cache, it will send it directly to Consumer
    1 without forwarding it to the initial producer. However, the content “/traffic/highway/A5/20”
    desired by Consumer 3 will be transferred to the initial producer. If Consumer
    2 also expresses an interest in the same content, Consumer 3 will aggregate this
    request in its PIT and not forward it. Once the producer sends the data packet
    to the forwarder, the latter will forward it to Consumer 3, which will forward
    it in its turn to Consumer 2 thanks to the PIT entries.![](../images/513458_1_En_8_Chapter/513458_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png)

    that Satoshi Nakamoto first implemented for Bitcoin [[13](#CR13)]. In contrast
    to the traditional centralized ledger systems, all the participants in the network
    keep together a copy of the distributed ledger with the help of a consensus algorithm.
    Every user is authorized to add or modify data to solve a complex mathematical
    puzzle. Every participant in a blockchain system is recognized with a cryptographic
    public key shared with other users so they can interchange information. The private
    key, in contrast, is kept stored securely in the client’s equipment. In blockchain
    technology, it is highly impossible to succeed an attack in the network system
    since a private key cannot be derived from a public key, according to [[13](#CR13)]
    and [[14](#CR14)]. The transactions in the blockchain are stored in a verifiable
    and immutable way.

    and nodes that participate are called “miners.” Mining is done without engaging
    any third party or central authority [[15](#CR15)]. Some examples of consensus
    algorithms are PoW (proof of work) which is used in Bitcoin; DPoS (delegated proof

    Scheme), a new scheme that focuses on mitigating interest flooding attacks in
    VNDN (vehicular named data networking). They have edited the interest packet to
    create a new packet field named “consumer_id” which is a unique integer value.
    They have also assembled the IDs of malevolent vehicles in a table named “restricted
    id table” maintained by each vehicle. A randomized time value is assigned to every
    vehicle in the network at the time of ignition. Arsalan et al. [[18](#CR18)] proposed
    a new scheme named TAP (timing attack prevention) to tackle the issue of timing
    attack in vehicular networks by merging NDN with SDN (software-defined networks).
    The proposed scheme uses the network controller to mitigate the attacker detected
    by a legitimate vehicle. To find out the time period in which a packet arrives
    from the source to the destination, a vehicle first calculates the distance using
    its coordinates, the sender’s coordinates, and the signal propagation speed in
    the detection process. Then, the time period value is deducted from packet arrival
    time to get the last vehicle arrival time to check whether the previous vehicle
    added any delay in the packet or not. Authors in [[19](#CR19)] discussed the security
    of VANET (vehicular ad hoc networks) using a trust function. The trust value of
    every vehicle interested in receiving data packets is calculated. They have also
    calculated the number of occasions an interest packet is shown by vehicles in
    a forwarding list. Sending data to neighbors is based on the number of vehicles
    that appear in the route. Manimaran et al. [[20](#CR20)] proposed an adaptive
    IDS (intrusion detection system) for NDN named IDSNDN. Using sensor values present
    in the vehicle’s OBU (on-board unit) and the heartbeat rate value, authors created
    the rules of the IDS. An additional packet named “sensor packet” is used by the
    IDS, which is included in the RSUs (roadside units). Once receiving a safety message,
    the RSU forwards it to the IDS module, verifying it based on the ruleset. If the
    message turns out to be fake, an alarm is returned.

    exchange between vehicles, vehicular networks help in reducing traffic congestion.
    However, malicious vehicles may misguide the whole communication. Blockchain technology
    is considered a preferred technique to grant security in real-time circumstances
    to deal with this issue. In [[21](#CR21)], the authors proposed a blockchain framework
    to address the issue of security in intelligent sensors of autonomous and connected
    vehicles prone to intrusion. The proposed scheme was studied based on different
    criteria, like a compromise of smart equipment, bogus queries of the user, authentication
    scenarios, etc. Shrestha et al. [[22](#CR22)] presented a public blockchain that
    stocks the message and node trust in a relevant distributed ledger to solve critical
    data propagation issues in IoV. Authors created a new type of local blockchain
    useful for IoV for real-time message dissemination between vehicles up to the
    borderline of a country. Kudva et al. [[23](#CR23)] studied the mitigation of
    attacks in IoV and proposed a blockchain-based decentralized trust score framework
    for the engaged vehicles to find block insider attackers. The authors proposed
    a detection system composed of two levels. In the first one, the trust is calculated
    individually by nodes, whereas trust scores for nodes are aggregated by a consortium
    blockchain-based system in the second one. Authors in [[24](#CR24)] proposed a
    blockchain-based secure data sharing system to solve the issue of trust in IoV.
    This system uses blockchain to store announcement messages. Vehicles that participate
    either to block generation or to broadcast announcement messages are rewarded
    by some cryptocurrency. Kang et al. [[25](#CR25)] addressed secure sharing and
    data storage in IoV by exploiting smart contract and consortium blockchain techniques
    which effectively prevent data distribution without permission. The authors proposed
    a reputation-based data sharing scheme to grant data distribution between vehicles
    with high quality.

    of domains. The ACOA (ant colony optimization algorithm) [[29](#CR29)] is inspired
    by ant behavior when foraging for food. They use the pheromones to spread the
    word to the rest of their team after they have located a nice location. A novel
    modelization approach is included in the BCO (bee colony optimization) [[30](#CR30)]
    to demonstrate bee movement behavior while searching for food sources. For example,
    in the PSO (particle swarm optimization) [[31](#CR31)], a flock of birds searching
    for grain works together cooperatively and intelligently to explore the surface
    of the target. The GA (genetic algorithm) is another well-known bioinspired algorithm
    [[32](#CR32)]. Creating a species that can survive in a certain climate is similar
    to creating a genetic code. In the realm of computer vision, this approach has
    been used on a regular basis, with great success. The FA (firefly algorithm) is
    inspired by the firefly insect’s behavior of employing light to attract the attention
    of other fireflies in its vicinity [[33](#CR33)]. The BA (bat-inspired technique)
    [[34](#CR34)] is another contemporary optimization algorithm. This method mimics
    the echolocation feature of bats, which allows them to distinguish between various
    prey in the shadows. Cuckoo search, according to several studies, outperforms
    population-based bioinspired algorithms in terms of exploration and is also suitable
    for large issues [[35](#CR35), [36](#CR36)]. proposes a CS-based optimization
    approach for extending the life span of a WSN (wireless sensor network). This
    approach deploys nodes in the network at random and organizes them into clusters
    once they have been deployed. The CS aids in cutting down on the consumption of
    energy. There is a proposal in [[37](#CR37)] for improving the CS. The authors
    suggest a solution to the dilemma of the roadside salesperson. When compared to
    previous methods, the suggested algorithm performed admirably. To address the
    NDN-based IoV security issue, we devised a novel algorithm we dubbed HG (HoneyGuide)
    based on the findings from several research domains. It is possible to think of
    the search for valid vehicles and the detection of fraudulent ones as discrete
    2-D explorations in a research area where time doesn’t matter. The HG also has
    the benefit of having a large variety of settings. Unlike other bioinspired algorithms,
    the HG method only uses two parameters: the likelihood that the owner bird would
    discover the honeyguide’s eggs and the population size (how many caves in the
    primary population). The suggested technique and the HG algorithm will be discussed

    communities started to propose various methods to bring the future Internet architecture
    NDN to IoV. Since data names are used in this architecture, there is no need to
    establish sessions or allocate addresses to exchange data, making it a bright
    solution to enable effective vehicular communications. Applying NDN to IoV is
    very beneficial in various properties such as in-network caching, mobility and
    routing, and in-data security. The latter is the primary concern of this work.
    NDN looks at security as the main component of the data itself; it doesn’t rely
    on the transmission medium anymore. Since all the vehicles in the network have
    the ability to cache content, the security attributes of the data packets have
    to be decoupled from their locality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the content to its name while creating data. This allows any user of the network
    to check the integrity of the data packet. Applications in NDN must use data signatures
    and cannot drop security.

    attack aims to send a tremendous number of interest packets to consume network
    resources and thus block legitimate requests. A cache poisoning attack aims to
    propagate fake content to the nodes of the network. Our work is considered as
    a contribution to resisting the last attack. We believe that blockchain can be
    a big revolution thanks to its decentralized nature; therefore, we propose a system

    chance it will be a better cave than average. After that, we will use the HG algorithm

    rank of the vehicle and, accordingly, the trust level. We also propose to create
    a new table of name MVT (Malicious Vehicles Table), which contains the IDs of
    malicious vehicles detected over the network. Every node will maintain this table.

    the blocks in the system.![](../images/513458_1_En_8_Chapter/513458_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.png)

    peers to discover whether the intention of other nodes in the network is malevolent
    or honest. The purpose is to allow only legitimate vehicles to accumulate a good
    trust level. In this manner, non-malevolent vehicles can identify malicious ones
    easily and eliminate them from the transactions accordingly.

    a rank (i.e., trust level) to each vehicle. Once connected to the network, the
    vehicle receives an initial rank value “R” which is refreshed based on its served
    content. The rank value raises if the vehicle replays with a safe data packet
    and diminished if it replays with a corrupted data packet. This transaction involves
    two nodes: the first one can be a consumer or a producer. It contributes to the
    verification of the received packet and thus modifies the rank of the sender.
    The second one is the packet’s sender; it will have an updated rank value after
    the validation by the first node. The forwarding process of BIoVN is illustrated
    in Fig. [5](#Fig5). Once a node receives an interest packet, the ID of the sender
    is verified. If the MVT indexes it, the node drops the packet immediately. Otherwise,
    the process is continued according to the NDN interest forwarding process.![](../images/513458_1_En_8_Chapter/513458_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.png)'

    here is to find the most stable table among introduced nodes by the HG part. An
    efficient new fitness function is also introduced and used in this phase. The
    HG algorithm selects the most stable route via intelligent configuration of the
    fitness function based on the parameter rank R, which will be increased when the
    fitness function is satisfied and decreased otherwise (refer to Section “[HoneyGuide
    Search Algorithm](#Sec11)”). Following that, the table is updated in the second
    part.

    X receives a data packet from another vehicle Y, it sends a request to the blockchain
    system to get Y’s trust level (i.e., the rank R). If Y is found to be recorded
    in the MVT, X will drop its packet immediately and won’t cache it in its CS. Else,
    if Y is legitimate, its name will not be recorded in the MVT, and X can trust
    it (see Fig. [5](#Fig5)).

    data is already recorded among packets which are not yet satisfied. If it is not
    the case, the packet is dropped. If it is the case, the packet enters the HoneyGuide
    part to verify the fitness function. The trustworthiness of the packet is verified
    based on the served content. If it is fake, the packet is dropped, and the consumer
    ranks the sender to “-1” and broadcasts the block to the network to update the
    MVT. If it is authentic, the consumer can consume the content if it is the original
    requester or caches and forward it to the corresponding interfaces. The consumer
    then ranks the sender to “4” and broadcasts the block to the network to update
    the MVT. Figure [6](#Fig6) depicts the basic elements of the BIoVN system.![](../images/513458_1_En_8_Chapter/513458_1_En_8_Fig6_HTML.png)

    done without validation. In contrast, in our proposed system, the interest packets
    are forwarded only if they are valid. In other words, BIoVN discards the packets
    coming from malicious vehicles, and only the interests coming from vehicles with
    high ranks are forwarded. It also communicates with the blockchain network about
    malicious vehicles and reduces their ranks. VNDN also has a significant PIT memory
    since each interest packet occupies an entry even if it is invalid, which leads
    to memory consumption compared to BIoVN, which has a miniature table. The same
    result also can be obtained when it comes to the memory utilization of the CS
    since VNDN caches all the packets and doesn’t reject the invalid ones.

- en: The main purpose behind this work was to propose a robust system to secure the
    Internet of vehicles. In this paper, we proposed a new system that introduces
    blockchain to NDN. After that, we combined a novel bioinspired algorithm HoneyGuide,
    with blockchain that we introduced in the data forwarding process. In conclusion,
    from the outcome of our investigation, we believe that bringing blockchain to
    the Internet of vehicles over the future Internet architecture named data networking
    can be considered a great help against security issues faced by vehicular networks.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dealing with such a system
    using blockchain technology and a new bioinspired algorithm. The future work consists
    of completing the simulation and comparing our system to the original VNDN.
