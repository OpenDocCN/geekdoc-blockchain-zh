    London, UKFew people living in a developed economy need cryptocurrencies to successfully
    go about their daily lives. Existing payments systems are faster, cheaper and
    much easier to use than even the most innovative cryptocurrency at this stage.
    Central banks exist to ensure currency stability; cryptocurrencies enjoy no such
    luxury. Deposit insurance schemes keep bank deposits safe. Foreign currency is
    readily available to facilitate international trade and tourism. People don’t
    tend to worry about their money being trapped in the country or losing its value.
    Even handling physical currency is typically less risky in developed economies,
    given lower average crime rates. People mostly can take for granted that their
    currencies will fulfil all three core roles.

    when in larger quantities, handling of cryptocurrencies also has its risks . If
    you lose control of your wallet or private key , you’ve lost your cryptocurrency
    . The system around electronic cash enables handling to be as simple as having
    a piece of plastic on your person and a PIN. Yet, distance transactions rely on
    a labyrinth of bank-to-bank transfers and processes, opaque to all. The banking
    system, which is safe and secure in developed economies, is often less reliable
    in developing countries. Handling of cryptocurrencies is showing some signs of
    winning over even electronic cash systems, due to corruption and general distrust
    of local banking systems. As wallet infrastructure for cryptocurrencies matures
    and becomes easier to use, handling of cryptocurrencies has a path to being “good
    enough ” in many developing economies.

    armored trucks to move the cash, insurance alone is estimated to cost up to 1%
    of the amount stored in developed countries like Switzerland.^([2](#Fn2)) Such
    insurance is likely to be much more expensive in developing countries, if it is
    available at all, given the perceived higher risk and less mature market for insurance.
    Cash in developing countries also tends to be much bulkier because of the lack
    of high denomination notes. A standard briefcase can hold $2.4 million in €200
    notes , just over $1 million in $100 bills, but only $250,000 in 100 Malaysian
    Ringgit notes or $47,000 in 10,000 Tanzanian Shilling notes.

    presents risk . Much of the hacking of cryptocurrencies written about in the media

    traditional currencies in developing economies. Yet, even now, for all of their
    shortcomings, cryptocurrencies can provide some of the functions of money in developing
    countries while addressing some of the inadequacies of national currencies . Savers
    can hold their own cryptocurrency wallets without the need to apply to banking
    systems or manage the cost and complexity of holding cash. Cryptocurrencies may
    be less prone to depreciation and inflation given algorithms that restrict supply.
    In contrast to expansionary money supply in many of the most vulnerable economies,
