    This worked for an eon but proved difficult when distances were involved. Carrying
    a heavy bag of gold coinage was not ideal when you might encounter bandits or
    thieves, or had a horse that could only carry so much weight. Hence, the Chinese
    invented paper money 2,300 years later, in 740 B.C. This was predictable in value—unlike
    gold coinage, which had to be weighed and measured. The paper money was issued

    such distances, bearing in mind that they were made from gold, and governments
    started to licence institutions, banks, to enable trade on their behalf. The new
    government-licenced institutions could therefore issue paper money—a cheque or
    bank note—that could be as trusted as a gold coin. This was a key move—from coins
