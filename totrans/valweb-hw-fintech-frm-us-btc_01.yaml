    The physical value tokens were cards and cash; the physical value exchanges were
    stores and garages and shops. The store of value was the bank. This last element
    was importantly different to the others, as the physical value tokens could only
    be used at the physical value exchanges. When they weren’t being used, some folks
    kept them under their bed, but that’s not a safe value store. So we had governments
    create a system to regulate the value stores to ensure they were safe, secure
    and could guarantee that they would not lose the value tokens.

    of value can be esoteric things, such as Facebook *likes*, Twitter *favourites*
    or LinkedIn *shares*; to virtual and digital currencies like World of Warcraft
    Gold or Candy Crush Points; to loyalty tokens from air miles to retail store cards;

    are transparent and easy to trade, like cryptocurrencies. The tokenisation of
    value is the digitisation of money. In fact, as the industry talks about tokenisation,
    we should just think of airtime and cryptocurrencies as part of that kaleidoscope
    of value tokens that now exist. After all, these are just digital tokens of value
    that represent something of worth that can be traded.

    Equally, we have a wide range and variety of value tokens, not just money. Of
    course, money is now digital and we have digital dollars, euros and yen, but we
    also have cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies change the game because they operate
    outside centralised control through the decentralised structure of the internet.
    That is a game-changer and is the reason why we are seeing banks and bankers investing

    to hyperinflation and so only South African Rand and US Dollars were accepted
    as payment. The problem here is that local retailers often do not have small change

    created a world of fiction in order to allow humankind to ascend to the top of
    the food chain.

    our world are all fictional creations of humankind that allowed us to conquer
    the world. It’s a complicated idea to explain here, but the gist is that no animals
    have companies, money, governments or legal systems. Most animals function as
    part of a hierarchy lead by an alpha male or queen matriarch. Man has created
    social structures and relationships of trade and communication that allow hundreds,
    thousands and millions of people to live together. By contrast, most animals have
    tribes of no more than a couple of dozen creatures. We have tribes of hundreds
    of thousands, organised in cities and all working alongside each other, thanks
    to our formalised structures of trade.

    70,000 years ago we began to migrate from Africa across Asia and then, 45,000
    years ago, to Australia and more recently (16,000 years ago) to the Americas.
    The key to our expansionism was language and shared myths that enabled us to believe
    in gods, demons and priests, and allowed us to move from being nomads to fishermen
    to farmers, exchanging trade and value along the way.

    we have indirect evidence of the limits to their cognition compared with their
    Sapiens rivals. Archaeologists excavating 30,000-year-old Sapiens sites in the
    European heartland occasionally find seashells from the Mediterranean and Atlantic
    coasts. In all likelihood, these shells got to the continental interior through
    long-distance trade between different Sapiens bands. Neanderthal sites lack any
    evidence of such trade. Each group manufactured its own tools from local materials

    Sapiens trade networks about which we have detailed evidence were based on fictions.
    Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers.
    The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fiction entities
    as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank and the totemic trademarks of corporations.
    When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish
    trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal. If archaic
    Sapiens believing in such fictions traded shells, it stands to reason that they
    could also have traded information, thus creating a much denser and wider knowledge
    network than the one that served Neanderthals and other archaic humans.”

    why homo sapiens are the only hominid’s left on this planet. 200,000 years ago,
    there were many other hominid species including Homo Erectus, Homo Neanderthalensis,
    Homo Rhodesiensis, Homo Tsaichangensis, Homo Sapiens and Homo Floresiensis. According
    to analysis by Harari and others, it is the very fact that we could create trade
    systems based upon shared fictions that exchanged forms of value through language,
    information and things that were useful or beautiful—shells, obsidian, stones,
    flint—that we ascended to become the most intelligent of species and, consequently,
    dominated the planet.

    Revolution, we began to search, explore and then, some years later, farm and settle.
    Until just over 10,000 years ago, most humans were hunter-gatherer nomads. We
    would move from area to area through the seasons, exploring and gathering food.
    Sometimes we would starve, since we had no means of developing crops. That changed
    after the last Ice Age, which some scientists believe created annual plant growth.
    As a result, we could seed fields of grain and grow food stocks.

    and hence we could create settlements. Then we had too much food and produce.
    As a result, we had to create another form of value exchange and, being homo sapiens,
    we invented this new shared fiction of money.

- en: Various stories appear about money but the first mentions date back over 12,000
    years ago, when ancient tribesmen in Antonia swapped Obsidian stones to store
    value. What this represented is a move from basic production of goods to the trading
    of goods and services, and we have seen the progression of the use of currency
    and value stores through the ages as civilisations and societies have developed.
    However, our progression of these stores of value are changing and moving faster
    and faster, as our technologies develop.

    from cattle to sheep. In other words, it was more of a form of bartering than
    currency itself. Seven thousand years of development led to a revolution in trade
    and commerce, however. In fact, every time we progress in technology, trade and
    commerce, we have a revolution in finance.

    they invented money. This first form of money was a coin, a shekel, which priests
    offered to farmers in exchange for their excess produce. This happened because
    the Ancient Sumerians were one of the first civilisations to farm, and create
    an orderly system of food production. Mankind went through a revolution of trade
    and commerce as farming became commonplace in civilised communities.

    This worked for an eon but proved difficult when distances were involved. Carrying
    a heavy bag of gold coinage was not ideal when you might encounter bandits or
    thieves, or had a horse that could only carry so much weight. Hence, the Chinese
    invented paper money 2,300 years later, in 740 B.C. This was predictable in value—unlike
    gold coinage, which had to be weighed and measured. The paper money was issued
    and underwritten by a government—the Tang Dynasty—and proved to be a far more
    reliable mechanism for trade.

    Industrial Revolution. As businesses were created that sourced goods from overseas
    and traded across national boundaries and over great distances, a new form of
    currency was needed. Hence, traditional coinage was too heavy to carry across
    such distances, bearing in mind that they were made from gold, and governments
    started to licence institutions, banks, to enable trade on their behalf. The new
    government-licenced institutions could therefore issue paper money—a cheque or
    bank note—that could be as trusted as a gold coin. This was a key move—from coins
    to paper—and enabled the rapid expansion of trade and commerce globally, as the
    industrialisation of economies developed fast in the 18^(th) and 19^(th) centuries.'

    During the 1950s, the United States led the revolution in office work and professional

    it proves to be a real pain if you end the lunch or dinner and have to write a

    His finance company was struggling with uncollected debt, whilst Frank needed

    back then being used mainly just in department stores, to the restaurant business.
    His innovation was to use the charge card in restaurants and then add interest
    to the monthly payments. That way the finance company was able to make a profit
    from every card that was issued.

    Club in 1950, and so was born the new industry of the credit card.
