- en: After writing *Digital Bank* in 2013, I turned to other ideas, since that book
    was primarily about the challenge faced by banks to adapt to new technology. For
    those who are unaware, the key premise of *Digital Bank* is that a bank must be
    built for the internet age. That means transforming the structures built in the
    last century for the physical distribution of paper in a localised, physical network,
    and reconstructing operations for the digital distribution of data in a globalised
    network based upon the internet. A digital bank is an internet-based bank, in
    other words.

    since, bitcoin as a currency has declined in volume, but the technology that currency
    was based upon, a shared ledger called the blockchain, has gone mainstream. Banks,
    payment processors, asset managers, governments, regulators and companies in general
    have all been experimenting with how to use the blockchain ledger to record the
    exchange of value.

    value things. More and more, I began to write about value stores, value tokens,
    value structures and value systems. I soon found that others were talking about
    the Internet of Value and therefore it soon became natural to talk about the ValueWeb.
    The ValueWeb is all about how the internet is changing the way we value things
    in trade and finance, but also in life and relationships.

    Pageviews, Klout and followers are a major force of value today. Companies will
    pay to get attention, and attention translates into views. It is for this reason
    that individuals are becoming important as media channels. An individual with
    millions of followers is a big influencer in their communities, and that is bankable.
    It is why someone like Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, a 25-year old Swede, is one
    of the most important voices on the planet. Who is Felix? He’s better known as
    PewDiePie, a vlogger who has 40 million YouTube fans and banked over US$7 million
    in 2014 from advertising on his homepage. It is the reason why American Matt Stopera
    has become an internet sensation in China (all thanks to a lost iPhone). It is
    how Chen Kun, Yao Chen and Guo Degang have become bigger in China than Jackie
    Chan, thanks to Sina Weibo, a microblogging site.

    network integrated with the smart network of the internet. Instantaneous, non-stop,
    global, real-time connectivity is changing the way we think and relate to each
    other. However, this new connectivity would be nothing if we could not trade and
    exchange value cheaply and easily through it. This is the focus of the book: how
    we can trade easily and instantly on a globalised basis through the mobile internet.'

    and this is being built in two forms. On the one hand, we have a new form of value
    exchange being constructed through the blockchain; on the other, we have the old
    form of value exchange being replaced by the blockchain.

- en: This is the two-stream world explored in *ValueWeb.* The pages that follow provide
    you with an in-depth review of what is happening in building the new world of
    value exchange, and the likely developments over the years to come. Unlike *Digital
    Bank,* this book does not focus upon banks or banking per se, but on the wider
    question of how the Internet of Value is being built, how it will operate and
    what it means.

    players in the emerging world of the ValueWeb, rather than focusing upon banks
    and payment processors. It is why the case studies and interviews contained in
    this book are with many new start-up companies and observers of this new world
    of the Internet of Value, rather than established companies and existing players.

    specific trends that are shaping this new world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the mobile connectivity that is allowing every single person on the planet
    to be able to use an electronic network connection. Seven billion people are now
    connected through a network when, just ten years ago, less than a billion people
    were on the network. That’s a massive change, because everyone on the planet can
    now connect and exchange value in real-time, person-to-person—if you prefer, peer-to-peer
    or P2P. The key here is that mobile P2P connectivity enables everyone to be able
    to trade and exchange value one-to-one, globally and in real-time. Most importantly,
    a mobile telephone not only allows you to trade, i.e., buy things, but also to
    create new entrepreneurial structures, i.e., sell things.

- en: A mobile is both a payment device and a point-of-sale (POS). This is why mobile
    trade is rising fast and is allowing every single person on this planet to connect,
    trade and exchange in real-time. This is transformative, as people who could not
    access trade and finance ten years ago can do so today. This will lift many out
    of poverty and is a big focal point for investment in the mobile ValueWeb, as
    illustrated in an interview with Kosta Peric of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

- en: As Kosta points out, you cannot build a mobile ValueWeb that includes everyone
    on the planet if you have expensive and slow-value exchange systems. The old exchange
    systems—the banking system—takes days to process payments and charges a high cost.
    The new exchange system has to be cheap—almost free—if poor farmers in emerging
    markets are to use it.

    an instantaneous and near free value exchange system. This second trend is clearly
    based upon the new technology spawned by the bitcoin currency, called the blockchain.
    That discussion is possibly best illustrated by my interview with Chris Larsen
    of Ripple Labs, a major player in the building of new structures for global value
    exchange between banks. However, there are many other views that are just as important,
    which is why half of this book is about cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and the blockchain.'

- en: So these are the key issues explored in *ValueWeb:* how mobile and blockchain
    technologies are building a new internet, based upon the global exchange of value
    in real-time and almost free. These themes are explained in depth in the first
    half of the book, and then illustrated through the interviews with the people
    building this ValueWeb in the second half.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that’s the new book. Half of the book explains the ValueWeb, and then the
    second half explores the people building it. I hope you like this book, and welcome
    feedback.
