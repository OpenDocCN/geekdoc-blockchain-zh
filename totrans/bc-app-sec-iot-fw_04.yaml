- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary technology that aims at embedding
    everything we interact with or use with the capability to share and receive information
    over the internet. By everything, we mean all plausible things, from the refrigerator
    in your kitchen and washing machine to a soil moisture sensor on a farm and sprinklers
    in a stadium field. It has limitless applications in every field, including medical,
    industrial/manufacturing, security, *etc.*, to name a few. This myriad of applications
    makes IoT a difficult concept to comprehend. To tackle this issue, we present
    this work which aims at defining the loosely bounded concept of IoT comprehensively
    with related examples and lesser technical jargon than usual. Slowly, we will
    dwell into technical aspects and real-life applications by talking about Wireless
    Sensory Networks (WSNs, a subset of IoT), Distributed Ledger Technology (or Blockchain),
    another revolutionary technology that is merging with IoT to give rise to an even
    more secure and robust range of applications. Then, we will discuss the third
    pillar, Artificial Intelligence (AI), that, when paired with the aforementioned
    systems, breathes life into the devices we interact with daily. Finally, we will
    weigh the challenges and prospects of the field.

    Things” abbreviated as **IoT**. We humans, as intelligent beings, have always
    strived to make our lives easier, from the simplest things like a pressure cooker
    to state of the art self drivingcars [[1](#c3r1)] and UAVs used by the military

- en: surveillance [[2](#c3r2)], *etc.* IoT is yet another technological paradigm
    that is working towards making our lives easier and enriching our experiences
    and interactions with the things around us. The concept of IoT is a little difficult
    to grasp because of the diversity of things involved and the plethora of current
    and possible applications. Wikipedia defines IoT as *“The Internet of things (IoT)
    is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines
    provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over
    a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.”*
    [[3](#c3r3)]. While one can make some sense out of what it means, it is somewhat
    technical. The definition given by McKinsey, though small, seems more logical
    and makes the concept a little more understandable, “*Sensors and actuators embedded
    in physical objects are linked through wired and wireless networks, often using
    the same Internet Protocol (IP) that connects the Internet”* [[4](#c3r4)].

- en: As mentioned earlier, the definitions in and of themselves are acceptable, yet
    they fall short of encompassing the depth and breadth of the concept. In this
    chapter, we will learn the fundamentals through various examples of what IoT is,
    but for now, let us talk about the other revolutionary technologies that go hand
    in hand with IoT to give us that enhanced interaction with devices around us.
    Artificial intelligence, abbreviated as “AI”, is a field of computer science and
    engineering that makes machines intelligent or, to be more precise, intelligent
    computer programs [[5](#c3r5)]. AI-enabled devices can by themselves automatically
    perform tasks that generally require human assistance or intervention. The definition
    given by Andrew Moore defines AI simply and concisely as, “*Artificial intelligence
    is the science and engineering of making computers behave in ways that, until
    recently, we thought required human intelligence*.”

    programs and software to learn and attain or mimic human-like intelligence, *i.e.*,
    become Artificially Intelligent. One can say that ML is how computers learn to
    become intelligent or as Tom M. Mitchell said, “*Machine learning is the study
    of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through

    Distributed Ledger Technology, more popularly known as Blockchain, which is a
    way of maintaining records. Technically, Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized,
    public ledger [[6](#c3r6)]. At its most basic level, blockchain is just a chain
    of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words. When we say the words
    “block” and “chain” in this context, we are talking about digital information
    (the “block”) stored in public databases linked together (the “chain”). Both of
    these

    like scalability and security [[9](#c3r9)] and what can be done about it. In the

    it is now, and then it talks about IoT as in the real world around us, so that
    the omnipresence of these devices embedded with the internet can be understood
    more clearly. By discussing the fundamentals, architecture, *etc.*, it familiarizes
    the reader with the technicalities involved in IoT and the requirements and considerations
    to be paid attention to while developing an IoT solution. It then enriches the
    reader with the current challenges of the field to give an understanding of what
    we lack in. At last, with prospects about the expansion of IoT, we have to give
    the reader something to think about and work on if they want to pursue a career
    in the field of IoT.

- en: In the world of technology, one would consider the IoT as something old. The
    thought or vision of machines communicating with one another can be found in the
    works of people like Nikola Tesla’s interview with Colliers in 1926 [[10](#c3r10)]
    and literature from the early 1800s. In a way, machines can be said to be in contact
    since the first Telegraph in the mid-1800s. In 1900, the first Voice over Radio
    transmission (Wireless telegraphy), and many more inventions and innovations in
    the field of communication and electronics followed, laying the foundation for
    IoT. Amidst all the rapid advancements, the development of computers began in
    the 1950s.

    defense project called DARPA in 1962 and evolved into the ARPANET in 1969\. Commercial
    service providers started supporting the public use of ARPANET around the 1980s,
    which allowed the modern Internet to come into existence. Internet and communication
    technologies were quintessential for IoT’s development. IPV6’s decision to increase
    address space was another important component in developing a functional IoT.

    into existence even before that. One of the first examples was a Coca-Cola machine
    from the early 1980s [[11](#c3r11)], located at the Carnegie Mellon University.
    Programmers there connected a refrigerator to sensors and connected it to the
    internet, so they could keep tabs on the drinks in it, preventing them from futile
    trips to the vending machine. Then came the toaster presented by John Romkey at
    Interop in 1990 [[12](#c3r12)]. It was a toaster connected to the internet that
    could be turned on and off from a computer. There are some pieces of evidence
    of the existence of elevators that could be wirelessly controlled in 1979 [[13](#c3r13)],
    but it isn’t very clear, so the Cola vending machine is considered the first IoT
    implementation.

    appearing in mainstream media like The Guardian [[14](#c3r14)], Scientific American,
    *etc.* around 2003\. UN''s International Telecommunications Union, ITU, published
    its first report on the topic *“A new dimension has been added to the world of
    information and communication technologies (ICTs): from any time, any place connectivity
    for anyone, we will now have connectivity for anything. Connections will multiply

    songs, movies, books, *etc.* How do they carry out these tasks? By using the internet,
    of course. With no internet, they have limited capabilities. Equipping devices
    with internet capabilities comes with many benefits. This can be clearly seen
    in our own devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. The same increment
    in potential upon connection to the internet is also applicable to everything
    else, from the appliances you own to electrical devices around you, or some other
    asset of yours, literally everything. The central idea or concept of the IoT is
    simple *i.e.* to take everything and connect it to the internet [[15](#c3r15)].
    All the muddle about IoT is basically due to the fact that its definition and
    idea are so broad and loosely bound, that it gives rise to multitudes of possibilities
    and examples, making the concept of the IoT difficult to grasp. To understand
    this further, we will see why connecting things to the Internet matters.

    send information, and in some cases, do both. With this comes the title of being
    smart, for example, smartphones, smart TVs, smart homes, *etc.* By connecting
    them to the internet, these devices exceed their limitations in terms of capabilities,
    functionalities, and experience. Let''s consider our smartphones again. Nowadays,
    we can listen to any song of our choice on our phones, not because we have them
    all stored in our phones, as we cannot possibly store all the songs available
    on our phones. This is the part where the internet plays a crucial role. How does
    it work? Every song in the world is stored somewhere on some device that can send
    information (in this case a song) when asked for by another device like our own
    phones. It uses the information that the internet provides, and hence we can listen
    to the song of our choice. This exchange of information is the ability that the
    internet provides us with. This enables even small devices like our phones to
    have access and utility of high storage capacity devices or even a supercomputer
    with just a touch. That is the power that comes with connecting our devices to
    the Internet. All the devices being connected to the internet can be broadly classified
    into three categories, and they work together to deliver potential beyond the
    scope of one single device. The categories are:'

    sound, light, *etc.*, and send this information to our brain for processing, there
    are devices that can collect information from our surroundings called sensors.
    They collect data from our surroundings like light, wind, speed, temperature,
    *etc.* If they are connected to some processing unit, they can send it there for
    utilization. Providing the sensors with the capability to exchange information
    over the internet makes them more powerful tools, as the data that was earlier
    available to the locality of the device can now be accessed from anywhere in real-time
    and can be processed by powerful computing devices to draw out useful conclusions.

    task when we give them a signal. For example, to change the temperature in refrigerators
    we usually turn the knob or press the buttons to do so. The commands can be as
    simple as an on and off button, or as complex as Mozart's melody playing through
    a speaker. Now, what happens when you connect these things to the internet? The
    accessibility of the functions or actions of the device skyrockets. You can now
    change the temperature in your refrigerator while watching TV and sitting on your
    couch in the living room, you can turn off the lights of another room from a different
    room or even outside your home. This expansion of accessibility and experience
    is another powerful tool that comes with connecting things to the Internet.

    you both utility and accessibility. They can collect information, send it to devices
    that need it, and receive information and act on it. This is where the real potential
    of IoT can be seen blooming. Let us now consider through an example the first
    two points individually and then, later on, we can merge them to understand how
    the things with the capabilities of both sending and receiving information can
    enrich our lives and make it easier.
  prefs: []

- en: For this example, let’s say IoT-enabled sensors that can detect moisture percentage
    in the soil are installed by a farmer on his farm, which sends data directly to
    his home computer or mobile informing him about the moisture percentage in the
    soil. Now the farmer can irrigate his fields on time. This also prevents him from
    over and under irrigation, therefore saving him money as well. Next, he installed
    an automatic irrigation system on his farm. If he connects it to the internet,
    then he can irrigate his crops at any time. The first one was an example of things
    that collect data and send it, while the second one was an example of things that
    receive input data and act on it. Now, moving further, he can connect both the
    moisture sensors and the irrigation system to the internet, and enable them to
    communicate with each other. To do that he just needs to set the threshold of
    moisture percentage. If the moisture level of the soil falls below that given
    threshold, the sensor automatically sends him the data and at the same time signals
    the automatic irrigation system to start irrigation. This way even at night time
    or when the farmer is busy, he doesn’t have to worry about irrigating the fields
    if the moisture percentage falls below a certain level because the system will
    do it by itself as and when necessary. The farmer can also take it a step further
    by making use of the weather reports. He just needs to check the weather reports
    about the rain. As soon as the sensor detects a low moisture percentage, it will
    first look up the weather report. If there is a probability of rain in the next
    few hours, then it will just wait for the rain. If the prediction fails, then
    the irrigation system will start after a few hours. This way, the farmer will
    save on irrigation costs, electricity, and effort. Here, the whole system of moisture
    sensors, auto-irrigation system, and connection to weather prediction algorithms
    form this network of devices that can both send and receive information, collect
    data, and act upon it, thereby making our work easier than before [[16](#c3r16)].

    line of work they may be in. It has the ability and tools to add value to the
    work of the organization and expand it in a previously unthinkable manner. If
    we keep on connecting previously existing devices and things to the internet and
    add new devices with capabilities tailored for IoT, some of the results or outputs
    will seem like magic. We can see IoT in action around us in our daily lives too.
    For example, we have all used or know someone who uses smartwatches or smart home
    devices like smart bulbs or fans. These smartwatches give us insights into our
    daily activities and health, and they do so by collecting physical data about
    how much we walk, our heart rate, our body temperature, *etc.* We can also control
    our smart appliances even when we are away from home, as long as they are connected
    to the internet. This enhances the experience and drastically increases the accessibility
    of the devices. For example, a little prior to arriving at our homes we can turn
    on the air conditioner from our smartphones, or switch on the geyser from our
    couches before taking a bath, so we don''t have to wait for the water to heat
    up when we get in. Over time, learning from experiences (through ML), these devices
    can start doing some of these tasks by themselves so you won’t have to. While

    is that they learn from our habits over time by observing our activities, what

    IoT solutions. The centralized architecture is associated with cloud architectures,
    in which a central hub provides a series of back-end services to smart devices.
    In the decentralized architecture, many scenarios require continuous communication
    between smart devices in an IoT topology without the need for an essential hub.
    The centralized systems help with event processing and decentralized systems operate
    more peer-to-peer messaging. Decentralized auditing is one of the essential features
    of decentralized architecture [[32](#c3r32)].

    (DDoS) attacks because of security vulnerabilities. In these attacks, the central
    server is bombarded with a huge volume of data requests simultaneously through
    multiple compromised computers, which causes the service to fail. Several DDoS
    attacks in recent years have disrupted organizations and individuals. Unsecured
    IoT devices provide an easy target for cyber-criminals to exploit the weak security
    protection to hack them into launching DDoS attacks. An overview of some of the
    attacks on different levels as described by Arora *et al.* is given in (Fig. [**1**](#c3f1)).

- en: As is clear from the above discussion, the Internet of Things is an omnipresent
    technology even in the current scenario and will keep growing exponentially. The
    advantages by far outnumber the cons of the technology, but the infrastructure
    to integrate it into our daily life to make IoT a daily commodity and an essential
    service is yet to be completely manifested. There are several limits currently
    holding back the best of these devices. Though IoT devices are pretty common these
    days, as we have seen, the full utilization of the potential of this technology
    has not yet been realized. There are many reasons for it, from security concerns
    like attacks from adversaries to privacy concerns of data theft or misuse of data,
    even by the companies that are collecting them, and the issue of scalability as
    the larger-scale implementation of IoT will be needed to make industry and businesses
    profitable. However, there are several restrictions with the current technologies.
    Several technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Distributed Ledger *etc.*,
    are being used to tackle these issues. Every day, we see new developments being
    made and milestones being reached to further enhance the usage and utilization
    of IoT. There is a lot to be done and a lot of investment and efforts are required
    to overcome these hurdles. However, it is all worth it if we consider the enormous
    benefits IoT brings to the table, from improving livelihoods to enriching interactive
    experiences with devices and surroundings. It even plays a role in sustainable
    development through smart cities, smart farming, and other services. Hopefully,
    by reading the above chapter and discussions, the reader now has a clear understanding
    of the emergence of IoT and its fundamentals like its architecture, frameworks,
    *etc.*, and also the overview of the challenges faced by the technology and possible
    solutions and prospects of it. This leaves the reader with the potential to expand
    their knowledge on the aspects of IoT that interests them and work their way forward
    for improvement in technology and the society we live in.
