    a platform where you can build financial and other products on top of it. These
    attributes all bound together are what convinced me that there’s a certainty that

    it’s a general ledger system that records transactions. You have a recorded and
    accessible electronic record of every exchange made by everyone. This can be used
    for any contractual exchange electronically. For example, you could record a lettings
    deal and the rental agreement along with the dates and frequency of payments due,
    which will then be taken automatically until the contract is terminated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today, most of these transactions are recorded on paper through government agencies,
    legal networks and financial systems. The reason for this is that there is no
    way to record such transactions electronically, as the digital services are insecure
    and untrusted. The blockchain has changed all of this by creating an internet
    general ledger that is secure and trustworthy. That is because the blockchain
    provides a method of recording value exchange that can never be transacted twice
    without the permission of the contracting parties. This is based upon a public
    record of the transaction, combined with a secure, private key that is held by
    the contracting parties. Therefore, when I transfer value through the blockchain,
    the person receiving the contract holds a private key that cannot be broken until
    they give up that key to the next contracting party.

    marriage’s viability because it is on the blockchain as public record. The marriage
    can only be legally terminated when our divorce is recorded on the blockchain
    and we give up our private key recognising the validity of the marriage.

    It is why firms such as Ripple are becoming interesting, as they can displace
    some of the old infrastructure built for the last-century value exchange called
    SWIFT. SWIFT was built in the 1970s to provide an electronic system to replace
    telex machines in banking. Ripple is now creating a counterparty banking system
    that replaces this and other infrastructures in between banks and corporate clients,
    with a real-time, shared ledger system that can be trusted. It is not based upon
    bitcoin, but the Bitcoin technologies of the blockchain shared ledgers. It also

    tier one banking system will be all digital. All transactions will be remote,
    and most financial needs will be satisfied by a screen-based process. This is
    well illustrated by mBank in Poland, who wanted to compete with payday lenders
    (Wonga has recently entered the Polish market), and so they created a loan feature
    using their app that could be completed in less than a minute. mBank’s loans allow
    customers to get funds in their accounts within 30 seconds of making the request.
    How is that achieved?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    them a maximum loan setting. That means that when a customer wants a loan, they
    are pre-approved. Hence, you load the app and request a loan. The app shows you
    the maximum loan you are being offered. You then choose the actual amount you
    want to borrow and over what period of time, and the app shows you the total monthly
    payments, including all interest and charges. Once you agree, that’s it. The money
    will be in your account within 30 seconds.

    to see the relationship between real risk and real need. The old branch manager
    relationship was an important one in working out whether the customer was *good
    for the money.* The old branch relationship is still an important one for complex
    dialogue too, where corporate clients need to go for in-depth discussions of trade
    finance needs. And the old branch structure is critical in bringing humanity to

    percent), mobile QuickPay transactions (80 percent), mobile bill payments (30
    percent), and ATM deposits (10 percent). And here’s an important milestone for

    deposits through digital channels than at teller windows (ATMs 48 percent, mobile
    deposit 10 percent, and tellers 42 percent) … Chase concludes that digital usage
    leads to more engaged, more satisfied consumers who are less likely to switch
    banks. They do more transactions, and they conduct them in cost-effective, self-service
    digital channels. And when they do head to a branch, there will still be plenty

    However, Roberto and his team gave me some interesting statistics that may back
    up this claim.

    than those areas that are unbranched. This reinforces item #1: Trust. When you
    can see where the money goes in and out, this builds more trust than the unseen
    bank.'

    branches and 37 percent from remote contact (the bulk, 30 percent of that 37 percent,
    is generated by the internet). The remaining balance of 18 percent is generated
    by third-party, physical channels. That means a whopping 63 percent today is coming
    from direct physical contact, and demonstrates the increased trust in the branch
    services, as well as the strength of the branch in building a brand.

    with 37 percent of customers handling all of their transactions just through digital
    access. Then there are a second group of customers, 26 percent of the total, who
    deal with CheBanca! purely through remote servicing via the web and call centre.
    A third group that represent around 28 percent of all customers use all the access
    points (web, call centre, branch). Finally, only 9 percent deal with just the
    branch and nowhere else.

    with zero branches? And the latter two—for over a third of customers (37 percent),
    the branch is still important, even in a digital-first bank.

    interact with the bank versus performing transactions. A huge 89 percent of all
    contact is via digital access, three times the volume of contact that takes place
    in a branch. Just 9 percent of customers visit a branch every month, versus 7
    percent contacting the call centre and 42 percent interacting via digital channels.

    For example, once you get inside, it looks a bit empty.

    (but isn’t) and something at the back that might be a *Star Trek* transport station

    a few teller stations. These are stations to chat with people about account opening,
    service and advice, and the typical staff member here is a customer agent without
    a specialised banking background.

    are the serious advice stations. Here, customers have to make appointments to
    see wealth managers, mortgage advisors or similar. However, you don’t need to
    wait if you simply need advice, as you can go to the transporter room. The transporter
    room is this weird funky station at the back.

    recognition using digital signature and shared screens with video operators.

    and it has proven successful at broadening and deepening customer relationships
    using those old bank metrics of cross-sell and up-sell. According to the bank,
    the service videostation has a 15 percent cross-and up-selling success rate.

    machine. CheBanca! boasts over half a million customers overall, since the bank
    opened for business in 2008, and is now rolling out its digital branch formats.
    Today, there are four branches based on the new format. By the end of September
    2015 there will be eight in a selected sample of medium and large towns. Equally,
    the bank intends to roll-out the videostation experience via Skype from September
    2015.

    I know folks will throw rocks, and say that digital customers don’t need branches,
    but today’s statistics and customers don’t support that view.

    about up-sell and cross-sell. I’m sure that CheBanca! and Roberto will do their
    utmost to treat this with care, as they want to be the coolest bank in Italy and,
    based upon this experience, they probably are. As he points out, CheBanca! has
    been awarded the Best Bank for Customer Satisfaction in Italy for the past three
    years and has a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 47\. He claims that “sales is a result
    of true customer satisfaction”.
