    Komninos specifies the smart cities and surrounding larger regions as environments
    with a high potential for learning and innovation, utilizing the ingenuity of
    population and societies with digital infrastructures to function in the physical,
    uniform, and numerical spaces of cities. The smart city model is defined in the
    literature in numerous types of ways. As cities develop and expand their services,
    governance and management are becoming more and more complex. Consequently, cities
    must adapt to address the economic, social, engineering, and environmental challenges
    of these transformations. Cities must become smart to face the challenges properly
    and increase livability and quality of life. This secondary research utilizes
    detailed literature review of multifaceted sources of information, such as peer-reviewed
    and quality academic journal articles from renowned databases. With the introduction
    of blockchain, numerous fields like banking, finance, health care, and supply
    chain shall experience positive effects. The sustainability of the smart cities
    can be further enhanced and ensured with the application of the blockchain technology.
    One important area in which the blockchain represents the important future is
    real estate and smart cities. Real estate has been going through global transformation.
    The challenges surfacing in record keeping in scenarios where the same household
    and/or property is put up for sale to several parties by the means of fraudulently
    forging the documents or records. The opportunities and challenges must be properly
    researched, addressed, and weighted out against each other in order to ensure
    a sustainable future to benefit the most if not all.

- en: 'The smart contract represents a self-executing digital business procedure.
    It is numerical agreement which comprises sets of regulations. As such, it operates
    via disseminated blockchain network. The pallet of regulations is agreed upon
    by at least two previously well-defined, distinct, and unidentified members. It
    is implemented by the means of the trigger, either by the particular event and/or
    demarcated passage of time. The agreement usually entails smooth redistribution
    of digital type of assets. Furthermore, the proprietorship of digitalized identities
    of physical assets to enlisted stakeholders is being achieved. This is being affected
    without involvement of any central third-party execution or human action. The
    smart agreement implements trusted agreements and corresponding transactions.
    These transactions are deemed to be (1) transparent, (2) traceable, (3) non-reversible,
    and (4) dependable. When a smart agreement is put into action, it cannot be meddled
    with or changed. The major shortcoming of a smart agreement is the restriction
    of immutable computer protocol to chart real-world contractual resolutions. This
    is especially true in instances where a disagreement or condition happens, which
    was not addressed earlier in the smart agreement. In 1994, computer researcher
    and law academic Nick Szabo pioneered the notion of smart contract. The smart
    agreement is defined as “a digitalized transaction protocol which executes the
    contractual terms.” Nick Szabo stressed out the enhancement of four basic obligations
    in legal decisions, listed as follows: (1) privity, (2) discernability, (3) validity,
    and (4) enforceability. The paramount utilization cases were (1) cost-effective
    business transactions without a liaison; (2) cost-efficient exchange of synthetic
    assets and smart property, augmented by self-executing included smart agreements,
    rescinding the ownership in the scenario when the lease is not paid. Furthermore,
    the digitalized clauses may be lodged in the smart property to achieve the self-imposition
    related to the terms of the agreement. The initial application of blockchain aided
    smart contract was Bitcoin script. Bitcoin script represents a compilation of
    basic and preordained instructions. These instructions were, on the other hand,
    significantly constrained in the area of expressiveness. In conclusion, smart
    agreement achieved eminence with the advent of Ethereum. Ethereum utilized solidity,
    which represents a Turing complete language broader instruction set, to code the
    agreements, since the year 2015\. Furthermore, every smart agreement is allocated
    with a distinctive address within a blockchain network. The protocol inside the
    smart agreement can be seen by each partaking node within the network. In this
    sense, participating members may opt to engage in the agreement. The smart agreement
    is typically put into action consequently once a transaction is referred. It can
    be processed independently via previously defined way including each node in the
    blockchain network. Smart agreements store up information related to the governmental
    paperwork, calculates, details, and associations in order to realize the logic
    implanted in them. Furthermore, the challenges related to the present smart contracts
    can be summed up as follows: (1) security shortcomings and (2) enforcement in
    connection to the weaknesses related to scalability [[8](#CR8), [12](#CR12), [15](#CR15),

- en: The growth of novel technologies, examples being Internet of things (IoT) and
    big data, has affected and enriched the advancement and innovation of health care
    all over the globe. This growth has enhanced the creation of the smart healthcare
    system. Smart health care is being exemplified by a medical system including medical
    cloud data as the foundation. This foundation utilizes (1) the electronic medical
    record (EMR) and (2) digital health history, in addition to medical IoT. The utilization
    is carried through by the means of (1) Internet of things, (2) conduction of information,
    and in addition to the (3) swap over technologies with the aim to construct optimally
    managed medical and health services. In contemporary times, the smart healthcare
    industry achieved speedy headway, yet, with the plaguing issues of information
    and system security. Representing the critical type of technology belonging to
    the Fourth Industrial Revolution, blockchain retains (1) decentralizing features,
    (2) secrecy, (3) tamper proofing, and (4) auditability. The unique mixture of
    blockchain and smart health care may be able to ease the critical pain choke points
    of traditional smart health care. This may be achieved by its application in (1)
    data sharing and security, (2) safeguarding of privacy, and (3) enhancement of
    user-focused smart healthcare systems. Furthermore, the creation of a multiparty
    medical coalition chain entailing government entities, businesses, and individuals
    is to stimulate the industrialized modernization of smart health care. Presently,
    the blockchain has gained the focus of the entire industry. Present research results
    involve (1) simple blockchain bottom techniques, (2) blockchain key management,
    (3) long-term authentication evaluation of blockchain signatures, etc. [[3](#CR3)–[5](#CR5),

    smart healthcare arena has not sufficiently matured. Majority of the present studies
    deal with the amalgamation of blockchain and current information technology to
    build a new data platform or data system. The examples of these are (1) the creation
    of an electronic medical system founded on blockchain and (2) the creation of
    a data privacy safeguard platform centered on blockchain. The studies searching
    for the role of blockchain in the supportable supply chain of smart health care
    from the perspective of supply chain are also important to note. For example,
    the blockchain checking of fake and substandard medications and blockchain supervising
    of the functioning environment of medical products, in addition to incorporation
    and enhancement of blockchain relating to a supply chain system are also important
    to note. Even though the listed literature review depicted a profound research
    on the application of blockchain in the smart healthcare field, unfortunately,
    the development system of smart health care under the auspices of blockchain is
    not yet evident and presently is devoid of the systematic research. In continuation,
    the involvement of blockchain in smart healthcare industry is rather difficult
    to be described. From stakeholders’ point of view, the search for a multisubject
    coordinated development system is at the present time rather unique. The contemporary
    application of blockchain in the area of smart health care predominantly remains
    at the private chain and shortcoming of exploration at alliance chain level. Since
    the most dominant firms control the information, in the realm of private blockchains,
    the information is insufficiently transparent which makes that its application
    is restricted. Contrasted with the private chain, the public type exudes a larger
    improvement as far as the informational credibility is concerned. The governmental/public
    chain ought to involve numerous participating entities. For this and other reasons,
    this makes it challenging to make sure the privacy and security of participants.
    Furthermore, the total decentralization impedes the system’s design. On the other
    hand, the so-called alliance blockchain type possesses the distinguishing feature
    of limited decentralization. As such, it makes it more favorable to the application
    of blockchain in the realm of smart health care. This is being achieved by inserting
    limited main body in the application process with the goal of (1) cost reduction,
    (2) decreased hazards, and (3) increased trust [[1](#CR1), [5](#CR5)].

    medical institutions, and medical devices by creating a health archives regional
    medical data platform. It utilizes the most sophisticated IoT technology. By doing
    so it ensures that the medical industry increasingly obtains the necessary information.
    Sharing of medical data is an essential step to make the medical system more intelligent
    and increase the quality of medical service. Furthermore, the distribution of
    patients’ data between organizations has not been completely achieved. In this
    sense, the blockchain represents a potent mean to resolve this issue. Blockchain
    represents various distributed data systems including multiple independent nodes.
    As such, it includes (1) decentralization, (2) time stamps, (3) collective maintenance,
    (4) programmability, and (5) tamper proofing. Blockchain involves comparatively
    few medical treatment-related applications. The contemporary research primarily

    in May of 2018, the security, privacy, transparency, and consent for patient-owned
    medical data became the focus of the healthcare institutions’ anxieties. It is
    important to note that the overt patients’ consent related to the processing of
    health data and the transparency as to how information shall be collected, in
    which way it will be collected and patients’ rights to full access to their health
    information have significantly impacted healthcare information systems (HIS).
    On top of the data generated by healthcare institutions, the patients tend to
    be increasingly active in managing their diseases by gathering health data utilizing
    mobile devices in addition to the sensors. Disseminating patients’ self-collected
    information with medical systems has a positive effect on disease management.
    Blockchain technology has been gaining broad exposure in health care. As such,
    it promised significant advancements, examples of which are smart healthcare management
    and patient empowerment. There are also smart contracts realized utilizing blockchains,
    and they are commonly known as Blockchain 2.0\. They represent types of protocols
    which allow the authentication and execution of legal agreements involving two
    or more legal parties by making them irrevocable. Interest in smart contracts
    has been gaining attention ever since the introduction of Ethereum. Ethereum,
    publicly released in 2015, represents the original blockchain-based solution incorporating
    smart contracts. Smart agreement permits patients to manage (1) access to their
    health archives and (2) safe exchange of data, in addition to safeguarding the
    privacy of the discussed exchanges. Potential utilization of smart contracts in
    health care, the intentions, and limitations, aiming at information sharing, and
    deliberation as to why there is still lack of practical applications in a real

- en: Among numerous thought-provoking applications utilizing the concept of blockchain,
    the most interesting applications tend to be smart contracts which encompass a
    programmable code which is being triggered into execution mode, only in instances
    when particular circumstances in the blockchain network are being achieved. “Smart
    contract” was first pioneered by researcher Szabo [[29](#CR29)]. From the start,
    this became an extraordinary concept to methodically execute agreements among
    the linked legal parties. A smart agreement is utilized to produce a contract
    between two or more parties that implement a predetermined course of action. Within
    the blockchain, a smart agreement is performed in a decentralized manner. The
    agreements are being executed by the blockchain only in instances when particular
    conditions are being satisfied. To reach the approval of both parties, the contract
    includes comprehensive explanation of legal terminology and agreements. This agreement
    is significantly more complex and necessitates legal authority as a mediator to
    assist the parties to reach common agreement via signature of both parties. The
    blockchain promises to build these contracts in a more convenient and secure digital
    way [[1](#CR1)]. The subject matter of the contract may be authenticated utilizing
    cryptographically hashed keys deposited in distributed ledger shared by nodes
    in the blockchain network. The sizeable description of terms may be kept with
    two involved legal parties. The authenticity of those before-mentioned terms could
    be validated by other members in the network by calculating hash of terms and
    comparing it with cryptographically hashed key stored in the ledger. Secure contracts
    solutions can be provided by further validation of cryptographically hashed key
    [[12](#CR12)]. In its research study, Luu et al. [[15](#CR15)] projected that
    secured contracts in the blockchain network could additionally remove the need
    for public notaries in future. Smart contracts may be utilized to deliver services
    such as asset trade contracts, insurance contracts, legal contracts, and registry
    contracts. Researchers pioneered an automated signing protocol among two authorities
    by employing decentralized network as a way for delivering time-stamped types
    of utilities. A smart contract may be utilized in various areas of businesses
    for distinct requirements. Kishigami et al. [[14](#CR14)] introduced a digital
    content distribution system built on the blockchain. They surveyed 100 participants
    containing digital content stakeholders and creators. The results showed that
    decentralized mechanism tends to be the most influential factor for digital rights
    management approach [[14](#CR14), [22](#CR22)].

    a new wave of innovation within cities’ services. However, even with continuous
    advance of cities and digital technologies, different challenges to engage citizens
    in social decisions are still open and need to be constantly improved. The concept
    of “smart city” (SC) was pioneered in the 1990s. It opened new viewpoints as to
    how new technology may affect the cities. Researchers Dameri and Cocchia pioneered
    the synopsis on the history of the classification “smart”. It points out to the
    pioneering Gibson et al. study entitled The Technopolis Phenomenon: Smart Cities,
    Fast Systems, Global Networks. Smart cities combined with ICT and urban evolution.
    Smart city concept is two decades old. It has been developing in a steady manner.
    The most important purpose of smart cities is in facilitation of the 1\. planning
    and 2\. construction of the intelligent services in the cities. On the other hand,
    this concept is also burdened with significant amount of skepsis due to its futuristic
    properties so that it is frequently being labeled the “smart utopia” [[4](#CR4),
    [10](#CR10), [19](#CR19)–[21](#CR21), [28](#CR28), [30](#CR30)].'

    proposes a blockchain-constructed and disseminated security information and event
    management (SIEM) framework to safely detect, store, and analyze IoT security
    events. All of this is being achieved while keeping their integrity and non-repudiation
    elements. In this sense, due to the blockchain technology, BlockSIEM showcases
    numerous security properties. Non-repudiation and traceability represent the most
    important features. Non-repudiation implies that the blocks are immutable. In
    this sense, an entity is not able to refuse that it generated a transaction request.
    The traceability of the information logged in the blocks allows to identify the
    trail of a specific security event. Furthermore, the BlockSIEM may be employed
    in various utilization scenarios. All of this ensures the 1\. trustworthiness,
    2\. resilience, 3\. Scalability, and 4\. auditability of the system. BSIEM-IoT,
    a blockchain-founded SIEM resolution which was deemed appropriate for IoT environments,
    was proposed, generating security events thanks to the effort of IoT devices called
    sentinels and reporting these through blockchain to be read and analyzed by SIEM
    miners having internal and external threat intelligence capabilities. The main
    contributions of it were the initial proposal of BSIEM-IoT as a blockchain-based
    SIEM, enclosing a smart contract used to handle blocks of security events to prevent
    and detect attacks over IoT scenarios. BSIEM-IoT used external and internal threat
    intelligence with the aim of detecting distributed attacks [[2](#CR2), [16](#CR16),
    [23](#CR23), [25](#CR25)].

    IoT ecosystems. One type of security architectures founded on the utilization
    of security events relies on a multi-relation between the attack-associated rudiments.
    There are security events categories, providing information about the impact of
    an attack over a given IoT gadget. They are being combined with weaknesses, to
    explicate the root causes of the attack, in addition to the explanation of attack
    surfaces with the aim to provide the information through which avenues the attack
    was undertaken. On the other hand, numerous blockchain-based solutions have been
    proposed with the aim of leveraging the security attributes of the distributed
    ledgers within IoT scenarios. An IoT security framework for a smart home scenario
    is based on the reliance on a hierarchical structure that coordinates methods
    over the blockchain network to keep the security and privacy advantages presented
    by this technology. Such a hierarchical structure is more appropriate for the
    particular requirements of IoT. The tasks on the network are being carried out
    in a different and adjusted manner than a usual kind of blockchain, example being
    the Bitcoin. The framework proposes to manage the network, and the belonging devices
    with the methods store, access, monitor, genesis, and remove. This framework was
    exemplified in the context of a smart home, but the application is opened to be
    used to other IoT contexts [[2](#CR2), [9](#CR9), [24](#CR24)].

    administrations. As cities develop and expand their services, governance and management
    tend to be increasingly complex. Consequently, cities must adapt to address the
    economic, social, engineering, and environmental challenges associated with these
    alterations. Cities must become smart to confront the challenges in a proper manner.
    Although it was originally built as a digital platform for cryptocurrencies and
    financial transactions, blockchain promises potential applications in various
    areas, involving city management. A smart city depends on the components that
    permit data collection and storage, backed by the specialized hardware infrastructure.
    An important aspect to consider is ensuring the interoperability of new applications
    with existing ones, so it is reused by the existing infrastructure, where possible.
    A smart city uses digital technologies to improve the quality and performance
    of urban services for citizens. Citizens' access to smart city applications must
    be guaranteed in an interactive way, so that they can access and transmit, as
    the case may be, real-time information. City officials and local administrations
    of a smart city based on a blockchain would benefit from a completely new way
    of connecting with citizens and visitors.

    on the infrastructures. In order to support the growing population in the big
    cities, a new type of smart infrastructure is necessary. This type of infrastructure
    shall be capable of supporting the efficiency and effectiveness of services and
    quality of life. Blockchain is a promising solution for a wide range of challenges
    faced by a smart city, but the implementation depends on the city administration
    and the needs of the community. A blockchain-based smart city infrastructure has
    the advantages of increased efficiency due to the automated interactions with
    its citizens, optimized distribution of resources, and fraud reduction.
