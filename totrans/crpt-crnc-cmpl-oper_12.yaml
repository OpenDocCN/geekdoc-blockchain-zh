    forming the underlying framework supporting the operational and compliance procedures
    of the cryptocurrency space and crypto-asset managers. While understanding these
    basics are essential, they are just a starting point as the cryptocurrency industry
    seems to be in a constant state of flux. Be it under pressure from financial regulators
    seeking to adapt to continued growth in the space to crypto-asset managers seeking
    to adapt their operations to new cryptocurrency innovations, there is a constant
    evolution in the operational and compliance procedures being employed in practice.
    In this chapter we will discuss evolving operations and compliance trends in the
    cryptocurrency and digital asset spaces.

    space, the crypto hedge fund universe has similarly continued to expand. According
    to a third quarter 2021 survey by PwC the total global assets under management
    (AuM) of crypto hedge funds was approximately $3.8 billion in 2020.[¹](#FPar1)
    This represented an approximately $2.8 billion increase over AuM in the previous
    year. Similarly, the survey also showed an increase of approximately $30 million
    in average AuM for global crypto hedge funds that participated in the research
    from $12.8 million in the previous year to $42.8 million in 2020\. The data also
    demonstrated that the bulk of crypto hedge fund investors were heavily biased
    toward family offices at 30% and high-net worth individuals at 54%.

    of their AuM into the digital asset space with the average allocation being 3%
    of total AuM. Additionally, 85% of those hedge funds indicated that they intended
    to allocate even more capital to the digital asset space by the end of 2021.

    crypto investments was continued regulatory uncertainty surrounding the space.
    This percentage was lower among funds that were actively allocated to the digital
    asset space at 50% however, it was noteworthy that even those with exposure to
    the space were still concerned about continued regulatory uncertainty. 64% of
    the survey respondents indicated that if regulatory uncertainty were removed,
    then funds with no pre-existing digital asset exposure would begin to allocate,
    and those with existing exposure would accelerate their investments in the digital
    asset space.

    aspects of the space there continued to be strong interest among investors in
    allocating to pure-play crypto hedge funds and well as more traditional hedge
    funds with digital asset exposure. This coupled with a continually growing cryptocurrency
    ecosystem suggests the continued long-term growth of the crypto hedge fund industry.

    has increasingly drawn the attention of the European Commission (EC). The starting
    point for much of the European Commission’s efforts in this area came from a series
    of sequential research and development (R&D) programs formed originally under
    the Amsterdam Treaty of 1997.[²](#FPar1) The formal name for these efforts is
    Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development. These Framework
    Programmes (FP), as they are known began at FP1 in 1984 and have ranged from FP1
    to FP9\. The EC began funding blockchain projects beginning in 2007 at the FP7
    stage. The next stage of R&D funding came with FP 8 beginning in 2014, also known
    as Horizon 2020 and continued with FP9, also known as Horizon Europe, beginning
    in 2021.

    are digital representations of value or rights that have the potential to bring
    significant benefits to both market participants and consumers. By streamlining
    capital-raising processes and enhancing competition, issuances of crypto-assets
    can allow for a cheaper, less burdensome and more inclusive way of financing small
    and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). When used as a means of payment, payment
    tokens can present opportunities in terms of cheaper, faster and more efficient

    consists of a type of crypto-asset which is intended to provide digital access
    to a good or service, available on DLT, and that is only accepted by the issuer
    of that token (‘utility tokens’). Such ‘utility tokens’ have non-financial purposes
    related to the operation of a digital platform and digital services and should
    be considered as a specific type of crypto-assets. A second sub-category of crypto-assets
    are ‘asset-referenced tokens’. Such asset-referenced tokens aim at maintaining
    a stable value by referencing several currencies that are legal tender, one or
    several commodities, one or several cryptoassets, or a basket of such assets.
    By stabilising their value, those asset-referenced tokens often aim at being used
    by their holders as a means of payment to buy goods and services and as a store
    of value. A third sub-category of crypto-assets are cryptoassets that are intended
    primarily as a means of payment aim at stabilising their value by referencing
    only one fiat currency. The function of such crypto-assets is very similar to
    the function of electronic money, as defined in in Article 2, point 2, of Directive
    2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council35\. Like electronic
    money, such crypto-assets are electronic surrogates for coins and banknotes and
    are used for making payments. These crypto-assets are defined as ‘electronic money
    tokens’ or ‘e-money tokens’.

    different options for regulating crypto assets. These options are discussed in
    the, “Impact assessment” section of the regulations. It is important to understand
    the options that were considered by the EC in developing the MiCAR regulations
    because they provide a context to the final recommendations included in the MiCAR
    regulations. Additionally, by understanding the reasons as to why certain options
    were rejected, we are afforded with a perspective on how regulators, specifically
    in the EU may evaluate future proposals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Specifically, the EC considered two options for developing a crypto-asset framework
    for those crypto assets not covered by existing EU legislation. The first option
    is a so-called “Opt-in” regime unregulated crypto assets. Under this first option
    the MiCAR regulations take the position that issuers and service providers that
    decide to opt in would benefit from an EU passport to expand their activities
    across borders. Service providers, which decide not to opt in, would remain unregulated
    or would be subject to national bespoke regimes without being granted the EU passport.
    The second option, “Full harmonization” would remove the different country specific
    regulatory regimes for crypto assets. Instead under the full harmonization option,
    the majority of issuers, except those making small offerings, and service providers
    would be subject to EU law and would benefit from an EU passport. These types
    of harmonization efforts would facilitate transactions such as the transfer of
    tokens and coins throughout the EU more easily than dealing with country-specific
    rules for each transfer. For reference, the concept of harmonization efforts is
    not new to the EU and is conceptually supported by previous regulation Article
    114 of ***The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)***.

    crypto assets not covered by existing EU regulation. The first option, “bespoke
    legislative regime aimed at addressing the risks posed by ‘stablecoins’ and ‘global
    stablecoins’.” This option focuses on the role of stablecoins in potentially exposing
    financial instabilities. Additionally, this option includes specific reserve backing
    requirements for stablecoins and disclosure requirements for stablecoins issuers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second option is “regulating ‘stablecoins’ under the Electronic Money Directive.”
    This option focuses on the definition of e-money under a regulation known as the
    Electronic Money Directive, also called the E-Money Directive. Specifically, if
    stablecoins have a value that is backed by a single currency that is legal tender
    then it is close to the definition of e-money under the E-Money Directive. If
    we assume stablecoins are e-money, then they would also be subject to a different
    regulation known as the Payment Services Directive. The MiCAR regulations in this
    section outline however, that both the E-Money Directive and the Payment Services
    Directive are not good fits to appropriately mitigate relevant stablecoin risks
    and cited as an example the services that may be provided by wallet providers
    in this regard. The third option is, “measures aimed at limiting the use of ‘stablecoins’
    within the EU.” This option would place significant restrictions on stablecoin
    related services as well as on the issuance of stablecoins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The EC determined that the third option would not be comprehensive enough to
    address the risks associated with stablecoins to the larger financial system.
    Additionally, the EC felt that the strict regulations proposed by the third option
    would stymie financial sector innovation. Ultimately the EC decided that a combination
    of the first and second stablecoin options would be preferred.

    criticisms, outstanding questions and alternative proposals have been raised about
    the methodology and potential unintended consequences behind MiCAR’s crypto regulatory
    framework.

    distributed ledger technology based database or not.[^(16)](#FPar1) This would
    be opposed to other tests such as examining the characteristics of the underlying
    digital items. Additionally, it could be argued that MiCAR’s approach toward seemingly
    grouping crypto assets such as utility tokens as it does to more financially oriented
    based crypto assets such as cryptocurrencies.[^(17)](#FPar1)

    to Nike for their Cryptokicks shoes that included blockchain control logic for
    mining, intermingling and exchanging blockchain-enabled digital shoes.[^(18)](#FPar1)
    This tokenized ownership of digital shoes will employ the Ethereum blockchain
    to record transactions under the ERC 721 NFT standard.[^(19)](#FPar1) The question
    has been raised whether these types of hybrid and multi-function digital tokens

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An interesting development in the increasing use of decentralized computing
    is the development of blockchain domains. The traditional domain name system (DNS)
    relies on a number of parties involved that have the ability to censor or remove
    content. A traditional domain name, such as a.com URL, is held on a server by
    a company. These companyies are called custodians and under the rules of the traditional
    domain framework are required. There are other entities involved in the traditional
    domain process called registries that also maintain the ability to revoke domains.
    Other companies that host traditional domain names may for a variety of reasons
    unilaterally decide to no longer host content and thereby take a website offline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain domains on the other hand are different. No custodian is required,
    and they are domain name systems that are a suite of smart contracts. These smart
    contracts are written on a public blockchain. This provides increased transparency
    because there is a public record of the blockchain domains, and anyone can take
    a look at the records. They are also decentralized which means there is no central
    server for blockchain domains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key difference between blockchain domain names and traditional domain names
    is that blockchain domain names are held in the individual users wallet as opposed
    to on a corporate server. This model is sometimes referred to as a self-custodied
    model. The blockchain domain model also creates a domain system that is permissionless.
    This is as compared to the permissioned model present in traditional domains.
    All of these unique features of blockchain domains allow for ultimately more user
    control over their domain name assets. This is attractive for example to people

    in different extensions. Two of the most common extensions are.Crypto and.Zil
    that be purchased through UnstoppableDomains.com. Another popular extension is.eth
    that can be purchased from the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) at ens.domains. Interestingly
    the ENS.eth names are ERC721-complaint non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[^(20)](#FPar1)

    run on the decentralized web. As a result, they cannot be directly accessed through
    traditional web browsers alone. To overcome this challenge there are a number
    of solutions including add-on extensions for traditional browsers and the Interplanetary
    File System (IPFS).

    real-world use cases as compared to traditional domains. One of the use cases
    being employed in practice for blockchain domains is for individuals to set their
    public crypto addresses to more convenient and easier to read English text-based
    naming convention as opposed to a long complex hex code. Under this application
    when a user is sending or receiving cryptocurrency, they could use this blockchain
    domain as opposed to cutting and pasting the complicated hex code.

    domain to point to decentralized websites. The use of blockchain domains in this
    way is similar to the uses of traditional domains with the key difference being
    that the blockchain domains reference websites on decentralized platforms. Finally,
    some people have taken to view the blockchain domain themselves as speculative
    assets and have purchased them and later resold them at a profit.

- en: As more capital from both retail and institutional investors has flowed into
    the cryptocurrency and digital asset space, a trend that has continued to develop
    is that investors are increasingly customizing their investment and operational
    due diligence procedures to address the specific challenges of the space. A May
    2021 survey conducted by Corgentum Consulting of crypto analysts and investors
    in the crypto space found that they are increasingly creating crypto-specific
    due diligence policies and procedures. The survey respondents indicated a higher
    degree of customization in the operational due diligence policies, as compared
    to the investment due diligence policies, in large part due to the higher perceived
    operational and regulatory risks surrounding the crypto space.

    determine what constituted best practices, particularly in the areas of operations
    and compliance, in the crypto space. Furthermore, 84% percent of those surveyed
    stated that they created new due diligence questionnaires for crypto fund managers
    being evaluated to better address the unique operational challenges presented
    by crypto investing. One of the largest contributors to this challenge noted by
    the ODD analysts surveyed included the large deviations from traditional institutional
    level practices employed by hedge funds in key operational areas such as custody
    and valuation.

    of difficulty is that as the price of cryptocurrencies has generally continued
    to increase, the value of the reward earned by miners has similarly increased.
    As such, miners have a strong financial incentive to devote more resources and
    computing power toward winning the right to validate transactions. This trend
    has increased to the point where miners are running into continued significant
    shortages of the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines with
    the highly specialized chipsets required to perform mining. This has led many
    to call for a transition from PoW models to PoS model and such a change was undertaken
    by Ethereum during the Serenity release in December 2020.

    the Chia Network that implements a Nakamoto consensus algorithm to utilize empty
    hard drive space to utilize a Proof of Space and Time consensus model in place
    of energy-intensive PoW models.[^(21)](#FPar1) These types of less energy-intensive
    protocols have gained traction as there has been an increasing discussion regarding
    the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies and mining by prominent individuals
    such as Elon Musk.[^(22)](#FPar1) In a political context, in May 2021 a New York
    lawmaker had introduced Senate Bill S6584 and companion legislation that had proposed
    a suspension of crypto mining activities and calling on energy authorities to
    study renewable energy alternatives on powering crypto mining.[^(23)](#FPar1)

    firms have begun to offer crypto-related services. For example, in August 2021
    JPMorgan, led by long-time Bitcoin skeptic Jamie Diamond, began offering access
    to half a dozen crypto funds.[^(24)](#FPar1) This follows the actions of other
    established financial firms such as Blackrock that indicated in January 2021 that
    it had added Bitcoin futures as a potential investment for two of its funds.[^(25)](#FPar1)
    While some governments have taken critical views of cryptocurrencies, others have
    embraced the sector’s growth. In June 2021, El Salvador made history by becoming
    the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar, and
    each adult was given $30 in Bitcoin.

    tender however, in July 2021 Paraguay took a different approach and proposed legislation
    that sought to better regulate the cryptocurrency space with a focus on mining
    regulation.[^(26)](#FPar1) From a regulatory perspective, in addition to rules
    such as MiCAR discussed above, regulators such as the US SEC have also increasingly
    indicated that oversight of crypto is a priority. To this end, the SEC listed
    continued increased oversight of digital asset markets as part of its 2021 examination
    priorities.[^(27)](#FPar1) Furthermore, in August 2021, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler
    stressed the need for increased investor protection in the cryptocurrency space,
    which he referred to as being, “like the Wild West,” and, “rife with fraud, scams
    and abuse.”[^(28)](#FPar1)

    regulating cryptocurrency were the dueling provisions proposed related to an August
    2021 US infrastructure bill, known as HR 3684\. One provision, the Portman-Warner
    amendment sought to require software developers, proof of stake validators, and
    decentralized liquidity providers to provide tax-related reporting on crypto transactions
    to the IRS.[^(29)](#FPar1) Many believed that such onerous reporting obligations
    would have a devastating impact on the crypto space and would also be technologically
    very challenging to implement. The other provision, the Lummis-Wyden-Toomey amendment,
    sought to exempt validators of distributed ledger data such as miners from required
    reporting to the Internal Revenue Service.[^(30)](#FPar1)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some countries such as South Korea have also taken measures to further regulate
    the crypto industry through the requirement of exchanges to obtain Information
    Security Management System (ISMS) certificate. In June 2021 it was reported that
    11 of the 20 exchanges that had received ISMS certificates, and were now subject
    to increased regulatory scrutiny, stopped trading certain coins that were deemed
    to be too risky such as Paycoin, Maro, Observer, Solve.Care and Quiztok.[^(31)](#FPar1)
    As countries continue to struggle over how to best interact with cryptocurrencies
    and digital assets it is likely that this trend of divergence will continue until
    ultimately a more standardized global regulatory framework evolves, similar to
    what has developed and will continue to evolve in the anti-money laundering space
    with regard to cryptocurrency oversight.

    in the cryptocurrency space. It began with an analysis of trends related to the
    continued growth in the crypto hedge fund space. Next, we reviewed trends in the
    European regulation of FinTech and Blockchain. As part of this analysis, we discussed
    various aspects of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (“MiCAR”). The discussion
    of MiCAR included a review of how crypto assets are defined under MiCAR as well
    as other key definitions including utility token, asset-referenced token, and
    Crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). The chapter continued with a discussion
    about the development of blockchain domains. Other topics covered in the chapter
    include the increased specialization of investor due diligence procedures for
    cryptocurrencies, mining chip shortages and proposed solutions and trends in the
    increased global adoption and regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrencies.
