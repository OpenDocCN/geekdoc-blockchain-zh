- en: Our motivation for writing this book is to provide a broad-based and accessible
    introduction to three of the presently most important areas of computational finance,
    namely, option pricing, algorithmic trading and blockchain. To the best of our
    knowledge, no other book in the market provides such a coverage. It is our hope
    that the book will be useful to senior undergraduates, graduates and MBA students,
    as well as researchers and practitioners. In its first part, the book reflects
    option pricing in different frameworks. A simple treatment of assessment of cash
    flows and fixed security derivatives is also presented. Finally, the problem of
    asset ranking is addressed in this part of the book. In a broad sense, the second
    part of the book covers algorithmic issues related to finance. The first three
    chapters of the second part addresses some computational issues related to the
    theory discussed in the first part. The rest of the second part, consisting of
    five chapters, discusses approaches for algorithmic trading, portfolio optimisation
    and risk management. The third part of the book is devoted to blockchain and cryptocurrency.
    A fairly detailed introduction to both of these topics is presented along with
    various applications of blockchain to financial and other applications. The wide
    coverage of the book and its authentic and well-expressive presentation make the
    book quite up-to-date from both theoretical and practical sides, and highly reactive
    to the problems of recent concern. We believe that in satisfying its objectives,
    our book offers a unique perspective to contemporary aspects of finance in a lucid
    manner for senior undergraduates, graduates, MBA students and regulators. Further,
    the book can serve as a useful reference for basic theory to practitioners in
    the area. Much of finance today involves a fair amount of mathematics. In the
    book, we have tried to find a balance between having too much and too little mathematics.
    Detailed mathematical derivations have been given in some cases, helpful aids
    have been provided in some other cases so that a reader can complete the derivations,
    and for cases where the proofs takes us too far away from the discussion at hand,
    the proofs have been omitted. In our opinion, the first two parts of the book
    can be understood by somebody having a college-level introduction to calculus,
    linear algebra, probability and statistics. The mathematical requirement for the
    third part is markedly different from that of the first two parts. It is due to
    this reason we have tried to keep the mathematical description of the third part
    to a bare minimum. Several chapters of the book have been used for offering a
    course on the theory of finance to Master of Science in Quantitative Economics
    students at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, in the Fall Semester
    of 2019\. The materials were well received by the students. We express our sincere
    gratitude to the students for their enthusiasm and helpful comments in the process
    of direct interactions. We thank Pinaki Sarkar for providing several suggestions
    to improve the coverage of the book. We also thank Sanjay Bhattacherjee for reading
    and commenting on some chapters of the third part.
