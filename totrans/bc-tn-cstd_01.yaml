    Even among those who don’t, most Americans have heard of cryptocurrencies—does
    “Bitcoin” sound familiar? If you have heard about blockchain, but you are unsure
    of how it works, then do not worry; you are not alone! Although blockchain may
    seem like an intimidating topic at first, we are here to help you become familiar

    technology known as blockchain. It’s important to be clear about what we mean
    by decentralization, as this concept is frequently used in blockchain. Let’s start
    by looking at the opposite of decentralization: centralization is when authority
    is held by a specific individual, organization, or location.'

    decisions. Then, executives pass decisions down to managers, who are in charge
    of lower levels. They are expected to perform whatever tasks are assigned to them
    by the executives. Going one step further, the employees are expected to listen
    to their managers and complete assigned work. While a centralized company can
    make achieving objectives relatively quick and easy, employees often do not have
    visibility and communication with other departments and higher levels. Lack of
    such communication can cause issues and lead to failures, causing all levels to
    feel the consequences. Often, a flaw in any part of the company can compromise
    the goals, which is known as single point of failure.

    (Facebook), Amazon, Apple, and Google. These Internet services follow a client-server
    architecture. The user uses a client machine (known as remote processors—think
    web browser or mobile) to send remote requests to a centralized server machine
    (known as a host system). The user receives results for their service request
    from this single course of complex service providers. On the bright side, billions
    of people use these superb digital services for everyday tasks, such as online
    shopping, posting photos, and calling family and friends, all without charge.
    But there is an overlooked cost to these “free” services: these companies collect
    and store large amounts of valuable data on user behavior in their centralized
    servers. With big data analysis and machine learning algorithms, this user data
    is converted into a product and sold to a third party. With this data, companies
    can target the users in ads and services, increasing opportunities to be exposed
    to security risks—this is all out of the user’s control.'

    which refers to the distribution of equal power from a top authority or location
    to every unit. Unlike the previous examples we looked at, decision making is not
    concentrated in a central authority or power in a decentralized organization.
    Rather than collectively relying on one authority, each member is independent
    and can decide on organizational activity. With decentralization, all members
    are involved and working with each other to reach a goal. Everyone can vote for
    decisions based on the organization’s rules.![](../images/535492_1_En_1_Chapter/535492_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png)

    sent from individual participants and utilizes [cryptographic](https://101blockchains.com/what-is-consensus-algorithm/)
    consensus methods (we will take a look at this later) to make a decision. There
    is no single authority to receive and respond to requests; the system still functions
    even if some individuals do not participate in decision making.

- en: On an ancient island called Shell Island, people frequently traded with each
    other to get the resources they needed or wanted. In the beginning, the islanders
    trusted each other and only traded shells and food; this works well for some time.
    After a while, the islanders traded more elaborate goods, such as jewelry, clothes,
    and tools. As the trades became more frequent and complex, it became harder to
    trace them. For example, someone trades with 20 people every day, but trades different
    items with each person. To address this, the leaders of the island hired a trusted
    “middle man” to record all the transactions to keep things fair and auditable;
    this also works well for some time. However, the “middle man” started charging
    extra fees for his work and even began to accept bribes. With much unfair trade
    happening, corruption spread throughout the island, and no one trusts the “middle
    man” anymore. Business slowed down as a result of fewer trades. To help the people
    trade fairly again, the leaders of the island dismissed the “middle man” and agreed
    to replace him with a more efficient solution. In the center of the island is
    a giant rock, which could clearly be seen by everyone on the island. The leaders
    propose that the islanders can permanently mark every trade information sequentially
    on the rock after the traders complete and prove the trade, which makes the system
    verifiable. This rock is accessible to everyone, so anyone on the island can view
    and verify these transactions, which means the system is transparent. If any records
    are mismatched, the islanders can vote to verify the record, which gives everyone
    equal participating power. The islanders also do not need to trust each other
    for this system to work; they only need to visit the rock to look at the records
    instead of relying on the “middle man,” which makes the system trustless. The
    islanders agree to follow these rules that the leaders proposed, and from then
    on, there was a happy ending for everyone, where fair trade was possible for all.

    network. In the blockchain network, participants can submit and confirm transactions
    without a need for centralized authority. Once the transaction data is saved in
    the network, it will be immutable, or unable to be altered. Members or network
    nodes can directly interact with one another on the network without a central
    authority or middleman to interfere with the transaction process.

    a fixed-length character string from the input text or data records. (We will

    The cryptographic hash function is designed to protect data against any alterations.

- en: The blockchain hashing algorithm SHA-256, or Secure Hashing Algorithm 256, generates
    a hash code of size 256 bits or 32 bytes. SHA-256 is a one-way hash function,
    meaning that it is easy to compute but impractical to reverse the hash to find
    what the initial input was. Even the slightest change to the input message typically
    makes the output hash completely different. To crack hash results, the best way
    is through a brute-force strategy, which means to test every possible combination
    one by one. The approach is to guess what was the original value being hashed
    by applying the same hash function to see if the result matches. We need to process
    2^(256) variants of 256-bit string, which results in a total amount of 3.2 * 10^(79)
    possible combinations. The total calculation time would be more than a billion
    years.

    output will always be 64-character text. Because of this, it is nearly impossible
    to guess the input from the output. Blockchain uses this SHA-256 hash function
    to hash transaction data and ensure transactions cannot easily be altered. If
    someone wanted to tamper with a transaction, they would need to rehash it, which
    would completely change the output. So, when we say a hash, we are referring to
    the 64-character text output of a hashing algorithm.

    this “puzzle,” they are allowed to add a new block to the blockchain and receive
    rewards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In “How the Blockchain Works” section, we discussed that all blocks are connected
    through a previous block hash to form a block list. The miner needs to solve exceptionally
    difficult math problems to add a new block. To find a solution, miners have to
    guess a random number (aka nonce) using the brute-force approach till they find
    the solution. The nonce is a 32-bit (4-byte) field. Each block hash value was
    generated by SHA-256 (previous block hash), Merkel root, timestamp, nonce and
    the predefined value of the difficulty target. The difficulty target is shown
    by the leading zeros before the hash. More leading zeros before the hash value
    will make the whole process take more time and resources to compute. With computers’
    power growing, miners can solve these puzzles faster, and so the difficulty target
    of the blockchain will increase accordingly. Figure [1-10](#Fig10) describes how
    to calculate a block hash in the proof of work.![](../images/535492_1_En_1_Chapter/535492_1_En_1_Fig10_HTML.jpg)

    in proof of work. The miner stakes their cryptocurrency as collateral for the
    chance to validate blocks. These miners become “validators.” The PoS algorithm
    selects validators to validate new transactions and add them to the blockchain,
    and validators reward some crypto in exchange. The more cryptocurrency miners
    stake, the better chance there is for the node to be chosen to participate in
    network validation.

    very peculiar giant stone money known as “Rai.” The Yapese made a stone in the
    shape of a disk with holes in the middle to help transport them. The price of
    stones was determined by their scarcity and the cost of bringing new stones to
    the island. Sometimes the stone doesn’t need to move after the bargain; people
    just need to transfer the ownership of the stone. It was used as currency for
    daily trade until the 1960s.

    Users must buy NFT sneakers to play the game. STEPN uses GST (Green Satoshi Token),
    which is a Solana blockchain-based token. The user can earn GST by walking or
    running outdoors through mobile GPS services tracing user movement or by “renting”
    out their NFT sneakers to other users. Some of the sneakers are worth thousands
    of dollars in the NFT market. StepN was launched in December 2021 by FindSatoshi
    Lab. The creative solution enabled STEPN to quickly disrupt the fitness industry
    and gain lots of attention from the market.

- en: In the earlier LUNA example, LUNA invented TerraUSD (UST) concept. A stablecoin
    coin is controlled by Terra algorithms to serve as a fiat coin function, like
    the US dollar. It aims to peg the US dollar at a ***1:1*** ratio, but different
    from other major stablecoins, UST is not fully collateralized backed. LUNA also
    allows holders voting power over the protocol. The protocol worked as intended
    until there was a scalability problem. If users return UST when the market is
    down, LUNA protocol needs to bring UST back to $1 by issuing more UST tokens to
    the user. This led to the total token supply of LUNA jumping from about 725 million
    on May 5 to about 7 trillion on May 13\. Stablecoin’s 1:1 ratio is no longer maintainable.
    It drops from $1 to$ 0.009.

    a physical asset in the real physical world, crypto is more like a “store of value.”
    It is not backed by any physical commodity or central currency and only exists
    only virtually, so it does not have intrinsic value. The price is determined by
    supply and demand of the market, but many factors can cause the price to fluctuate.

    step in the transaction process. Consensus algorithms, such as PoW, PoS, form
    the backbone of the blockchain. We then continued on to the evolution of monetary
    systems, from the barter system to cryptocurrency. At last, we briefly introduced
