    be used for security applications in IoT projects. By merging blockchain with
    IoT, the data collected by smart devices in the IoT network can be securely stored.
    Data is the most valuable component of an IoT network and securing it using blockchain

    information. The time it takes to identify and locate where and when along the
    supply chain the issues arose can cost a company large sums of money in lawsuits
    for selling bad or harmful products. Besides the aspect of falsified, distorted

    has to be suitable for corporate needs and standards. As an enterprise, you want
    stable fees, but cryptocurrency price has too much volatility. VeChain solves
    this problem by utilizing a multilayer payment model. This feature helps enterprises
    to manage the payment of multiple dapps efficiently from one master account and
    also helps them to work better with business partners who do not want to deal
    with crypto assets.

- en: As we have discussed before, VET economic model was designed to create more
    predictable and stable environments for retailers. Aside from VET, there will
    also be another crypto called VeChain Thor Token (VTHO). For holding VET, even
    if you aren’t running a node, VeChain rewards you with THOR. This structure is
    similar to NEO’s GAS and is used to run smart contracts and applications built
    on VET. This means that companies which rely on VeChain to track their supply
    chains and reinforce logistical flows have a real incentive to run their own node.

    platform’s main net. With the launch, the network moved off the Ethereum blockchain
    onto its own blockchain and, the team began swapping VEN for VET. The next step
    for the company is to expand the ecosystem with more dapps and strategic enterprise
    partnerships. The make or break of any blockchain project is their partnerships,
    especially for enterprise blockchain solutions. Talking about partnerships, VeChain
    has done a great job so far, when it comes to attracting big industry players
    as partners and clients. The most notable are PwC, DNV GL, BMW, and Kuehne & Nagel.
    VeChain is part of the PwC incubator program; DNV GL provides services to oil
    and gas, power, maritime, and renewable companies.

- en: WaltonChain is a decentralized platform which combines blockchain technology
    and the IoT using RFID technology to create a Value Internet of Things (VIoT).
    Although the technology of RFID is not new, WaltonChain has patented unique RFID
    chips that can read and write data directly to the blockchain, thus creating a
    genuine, trustworthy, and traceable business ecosystem, with complete data sharing
    and absolute information transparency. The name “Walton” from WaltonChain is a
    tribute to the original inventor of RFID technology, Charlie Walton. WaltonChain’s
    logo can be found in [Figure 2.4](#ch2fig4).

- en: The RFID chip is developed by the subsidiary of WaltonChain, Silitec (technical
    support arm which specialized in manufacturing chips), and not outsourced. The
    chip costs under 5 cents per tag (industry average 15 to 20 cents) and will be
    lower in cost in the future due to economies of scale.

- en: The goal of WaltonChain is quite straightforward. While the public blockchain
    itself can be used on different types of use cases, the main idea is to solve
    the problems in the supply chain management space. The project wants to coordinate
    data among large corporations by analyzing and tracking their products during
    every production and distribution step. The data is always saved on the blockchain
    to make sure it is tamper-proof and authentic. By utilizing the blockchain, third
    parties cannot easily “cheat” their data submission as everything needs to be
    confirmed and authorized by the blockchain.

- en: The supply chain management industry has been facing a lot of problems in the
    past few decades. It is quite hard to track where the product originally comes
    from, as there are multiple third parties who get involved in the whole distribution
    process. The whole inefficiency problem becomes even worse when you involve import
    and export processes. And this is where blockchain can significantly improve such
    problem. By using RFID chips and utilizing the blockchain at the same time, every
    distribution step is tracked and must be verified by different entities.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WaltonChain is made up of a parent chain, WaltonChain, and many other subchains
    (child chains), which run independently from the parent chain. The advantages
    of having child chains includes not congesting the parent chain, as the main transactions
    are run and stored in the child chains itself, instead of in the main chain like
    many other solutions. This offers unlimited scalability as having more child chains
    will not congest and overload the network of the parent chain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The child chains are also fully customizable to the specific needs of the partners,
    such as being able to choose to become a public or private chain, having a different
    consensus algorithm from the parent chain, having hierarchical chains (child chains
    within child chains), hosting ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) off these child chains,
    supporting different programming languages such as Solidity, C++, Java, Python,
    and so on. Companies are also able to directly purchase predesigned child chains
    that are already proven to work for other companies. The main aim of WaltonChain
    is to connect data. In the WaltonChain ecosystem, the multichain architecture
    formed by the parent chain and child chains follows the development trend of cross-industry
    coverage in the blockchain technology.
