- en: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled blockchain technologies (BCT) in 6G-based
    Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a disruptive technological achievement that can
    affect business models and initiatives significantly. It provides various advantages
    such as developing innovative applications, lowering operation costs, increasing
    collaboration among supply chain partners, agility, transparency, accountability,
    decentralization, security, and interoperability. However, such novel technologies
    need to be adopted and used successfully by organizations to benefit the global
    economy. Despite their prospective advantages, even the most state-of-the-art
    technologies are susceptible to becoming obsolete if organizations do not adopt
    them. A theoretical understanding is necessary to define the underlying constructs
    encouraging or discouraging adoption and usage. Accordingly, this chapter investigates
    the constructs affecting the organizational adoption and usage of AI-enabled BCT
    in 6G-based SCM systems and the economic impact of this adoption. A systematic
    literature review method was followed to find out fundamental constructs in the
    literature. Then, a theoretical research model consisting of 17 constructs was
    developed by following the Technology-Organization-Environment Framework. After
    then, the economic impact of the organizational adoption of AI and BCT integration
    on the 6G-based SCM was analyzed.

- en: Supply Chain Management (SCM) includes managing business operations, consisting
    of logistics, purchasing, the flow of materials, and finance through an information
    and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure by integrating all peers in
    the supply chain including manufacturers, retailers, suppliers, wholesalers, and
    end-users into one single system. An effectively managed SCM system can significantly
    decrease a company's operating expenses, and increase profits. Therefore, it is
    indispensable to adopt and use this system to survive in the market and gain a
    competitive advantage [[1](#CR1)].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The earlier definitions of SCM covered the flow of goods from supplier to manufacturer,
    distributor, and consumer, and then its scope was expanded further, covering the
    source of the earliest supply to end consumption [[2](#CR2)]. Today, the SCM is
    a global phenomenon as supply chains are no longer confined to national boundaries.
    This means that the challenges of globalization are reflected in the SCM [[3](#CR3)].
    Interest in these challenges is growing both in the academic field and among practitioners.
    In this context, new solutions are sought to make transactions much more transparent,
    traceable, secure, effective, and faster at lower costs in a global supply chain.
    ICT has become an enabler to overcome these challenges by effectively integrating
    SCM actors and logistics processes. Moreover, further improvements in ICT will
    expedite more and longer distance trade [[4](#CR4)]. At this point, the advances
    in blockchain technology (BCT), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless network
    technology, and a combination of these disruptive technologies provide a significant
    potential for innovative possibilities in the SCM.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BCT could provide convenient solutions such as decentralized management, robustness,
    immutable audit trail, privacy, and security [[5](#CR5), [6](#CR6)]. BCT applications
    in the SCM provide the physical tracking of supply chains, the security of SCM
    systems, and the use of smart contracts. Thus, organizations can enhance their
    supply chains’ reliability, efficiency, and transparency and decrease overall
    operation and logistics costs by adopting BCT in their SCM systems [[7](#CR7)].
    Despite these promising benefits, a mere 9 percent of organizations have invested
    in BCT-based SCM systems [[8](#CR8)]. Additionally, integrating AI into BCT can
    enhance BCT’s underlying architecture and make AI more coherent and easier to
    understand. Even though the integration of AI and BCT remains partially discovered,
    both technologies are developing rapidly. Combining the key features of the technologies
    (e.g., AI’s enabling analytics and decision-making from the collected big data
    as well as BCT’s distributed, decentralized, immutable ledger used to store encrypted
    data) will bring innovative solutions. Moreover, the 6G technology infrastructure
    enables fast transactions, instant tracking, and speedy data sharing.

    global economy. It is predicted that the contribution of AI to the global economy
    will increase to approximately $16 trillion by 2030 [[9](#CR9)]. Productivity
    growth in this contribution is expected to occupy a place of about $ 6.6 trillion,
    while the side effects of consumption are expected to be around $9.1 trillion.
    Similarly, BCT can boost the economy worldwide by $1.76 trillion in the same year.
    The value is primarily created by advancing tracking and tracing levels and enhancing
    trust. An AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based SCM can further improve the performance of
    SCM systems.

- en: Considering these potential benefits of AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based SCM, the
    adoption of such systems constitutes a crucial source of competitive advantage.
    However, organizations do not adopt breakthrough technologies once their advantages
    are revealed. In other words, developing innovative technologies do not mean that
    they will be successfully accepted and utilized. Above all, technology adoption
    requires an initial awareness followed by prioritization of needs and examination
    of strategic alignments, benefits, difficulties, and barriers of the specific
    technology as a whole. Despite their challenges, organizations are more likely
    to adopt the emerging technologies if they are convinced of the potential economic
    benefits these technologies promise [[10](#CR10)]. Therefore, a conceptual understanding
    is required to grasp the fundamental causes that encourage or discourage acceptance
    and utilization [[10](#CR10)].

    of AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based SCM through developing a research model formed on
    the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework [[11](#CR11)]. Thus, adopting
    and using such an innovative system by the organization will be increased by adopting
    a solution implementation approach to transcend organizational obstacles; respectively,
    the economic impacts of adopting AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based SCM in organizations
    will be explored. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this chapter represents
    the first attempt in the literature. Thus, this study intends to fill this gap.

    high-speed internet connection and linking all network operators to one single
    core [[12](#CR12)], although the 5G technology is not yet implemented at full
    scale worldwide, and there are still issues to be solved in 5G. The concept of

    Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity will be much denser than the 5G and up to
    100 times faster. With 100 Gb per second peak data rates, latency, which can be
    reduced to microseconds, is one millisecond in the 5G. These main features have

- en: In simple terms, a blockchain is an open database that holds a distributed ledger,
    typically in a peer-to-peer network [[15](#CR15)]. The BCT is based on a cryptographic
    chain of blocks without a central repository or an authority, enabling a group
    of participants to record transactions in a collective ledger [[16](#CR16)]. Each
    block connects to the previous block, creating a chain. The chaining process is
    executed via cryptographic assurance systems, and the data is immutable once published.
    This is enabled through the underlying consensus protocol, which is a procedure
    where all transactions are verified by all the nodes [[17](#CR17)]. Accordingly,
    transaction history becomes precise and transparent across the node participants
    since each record forms an audit trail in the chains of blocks. Hence, this procedure
    increases the privacy and security of the wireless network [[17](#CR17)].

- en: Public, private, and consortium blockchains are the major BTC technology categories
    [[18](#CR18)]. In a public BCT, participants can join without permission. This
    is the traditional BCT with no access limitation for verifying transactions, and
    creating a consensus block. Therefore, it is highly decentralized. A well-known
    example of a public blockchain is Bitcoin and Ethereum. Private blockchains, however,
    require inviting and permitting the selected participants by the network administrator
    for the specified transactions. Hyperledger can be an example of this type. Finally,
    consortium or hybrid blockchains are partly public and partly private. Pre-selected
    participants form a consortium, but only authorized participants can take part
    in the network. IBM Food Trust [[19](#CR19)] platform is one of the examples of
    this type of BCT.

    achieved in transaction costs and time in addition to the opportunities of enhanced
    transparency and security, advanced traceability, and increased efficiency. These
    benefits can create a tremendous shift in supply chain management systems. Several
    companies have already adopted BCT-based SCM systems and reported that the systems
    could reduce source control time from days or weeks to seconds [[19](#CR19)].

    that will likely improve the performance in the organizational context [[56](#CR56)–[58](#CR58)].
    AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based SCM systems increases transparency and, therefore,

    [[26](#CR26)]. Thus, complexity is negatively related to adoption. AI-enabled
    BCT’s decentralized structure has the feature to minimize this complexity by eliminating
    the transaction verification process complexity that may occur using a centralized

    Makhdom et al. [[63](#CR63)] suggest that increased BCT size can cause inefficiency
    and slow the transactions. As users enter data into the system, the BCT will expand
    to maintain the hash algorithm associated with the added data [[26](#CR26)]. This
    expansion brings with it storage space and high processing power needs. Thus,
    it is considered a construct that can affect the adoption of AI-enabled BCT in

    insecurity is an obstacle to technology readiness. Insecure potential users are
    likely to be skeptical about new ICT and may not even want to make an effort to

    support technology readiness and drive the adoption process of new ICT such as
    BCT [[45](#CR45)]. The fact that supply chain practitioners favor BCT will have

    need at a low cost with high trust and other market-related advantages. New collaborations
    and links between organizations can be established thanks quickly to AI-enabled
    BCT in 6G-based SCM because organizations trust the technology instead of their
    peers. Due to this technology, complex interconnections can be easily managed,
    solving problems arising from information asymmetry among partners and trust in
    financial transactions.

- en: Considering all of these promising motivations, it can be asserted that this
    technology will drastically affect the global economy. However, it is crucial
    for organizations to take into consideration not only the technology but also
    the organizational and environmental aspects to successfully adopt this technology
    to overcome barriers to adopting and using it. The findings of the conducted SLR
    provide critical strategic implications to successfully design, develop, implement,
    and maintain AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based SCM systems. As part of the supply chain
    network, constructs defined under the context of the environment, such as government
    policy, regulations, and support, trading partner attitude (pressure or resistance),
    interorganizational trust, and market dynamics are critical. As an interorganizational
    ICT, SCM systems, one of the inter-organizational ICTS, are utilized for information
    transfer across organizations in the network. A shared SCM system must be used
    by partners, so the preference for transitioning to AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based
    SCMs is largely influenced by environmental variables. SCM systems providers should
    focus further on the leading companies in the supply chains as trading partner
    attitude (pressure or resistance) has a considerable significance on the adoption
    decision of AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based SCM systems.

- en: A disruptive technology, AI-enabled BCT will be predicted to reshape the 6G-based
    SCM systems and business transactions across the countries by providing promising
    opportunities such as improving transparency, business analytics visualizations,
    high-speed transactions, immutability, real-time traceability, and efficiency.
    Correspondingly, it is estimated that the impact on the global economy of this
    innovative technology will be drastic. Despite these promising benefits, organizations
    have not adopted this technology yet. It is still in an infancy stage. To take
    advantage of this technology, organizations need to remove the barriers before
    adopting and using it successfully. Thus, this study aims to provide novel and
    reliable insights for ICT service providers to devise their SCM systems and companies
    to overcome obstacles and resistance to adoption and use.

- en: This chapter makes substantial contributions by conducting an SLR to find out
    constructs affecting the adoption and usage of AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based SCM
    systems. Subsequent to the SLR, it became more apparent that no study aims to
    unify the adoption of AI, BCT, 6G-based network, and SCM. This chapter addresses
    this gap in the research literature. The other contribution of this study is to
    develop a theoretically grounded research model by following a well-known ICT
    adoption theory by identifying the primary contexts and related constructs to
    contribute to the adoption of this technology.

- en: As a future investigation, a quantitative research method is planned to determine
    the most critical constructs affecting the adoption of AI-enabled BCT in 6G-based
    SCM systems in the context of the organization because one major limitation of
    the present study is the lack of quantitative data collection from responders
    with various backgrounds.
