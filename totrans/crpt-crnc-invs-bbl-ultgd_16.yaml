- en: At the very beginning of this book, I wrote that many people do not take cryptocurrency
    seriously because of the many myths surrounding the market. Let's summarize these
    myths now and finally dispel them.

    the cryptocurrency market is the potential for large profits and enter the market
    only for this reason. However, in my opinion, the profit is an absolutely secondary
    thing, which you can make in any business. The question is: what risks are you
    willing to take? Therefore, the most important topic in cryptocurrency is risk.'

    in the cryptocurrency market. Some people suppose that if you take a small risk
    in any other market and get a small profit from it, then here you get hundreds
    of times more profit when taking the same amount of risk. It is not true. The
    ratio of profits to risks is always approximately average. If it was really possible
    to get a large profit with low risks, Swiss banks would be emptied of all banknotes
    because everybody would have already invest in this business.

    because it has become popular recently and all the profits have already been made
    and divided. I agree only with the fact it is going to be tough on the newcomers
    because of all the cryptocurrency hype but is this the reason to think that it's
    too late to get into the market and get your tidbit? If you constantly study,
    strive and try, you will also start to make good money. Hard work always pays
    off. It may take you more time and resources, but a slogger will definitely be
    rewarded with success.

    say that only programmers or professional traders can work in this market. This
    is a myth. If you are a doctor, a teacher, or a middle-rank manager, you also
    can earn big dough in the cryptocurrency market. One can learn the necessary information
    and acquire the necessary skills no matter what their current skills. Nobody is
    born to be an artist, but you can become an artist by mastering different drawing
    techniques.

    reading my book. I only hope that you at least now know that cryptocurrency is
    a present-day reality, not a matter of the future. The sooner you understand this,
    the further you can tear yourself away from the sceptics who run behind the locomotive.
    Therefore, I strongly advise you to say "yes" to cryptocurrency.

    I’ve helped you not just to sort through the cryptocurrency myths and basics but
    also helped you create a foundation for profitable long-term business in this
    area. A keystone has already been laid, but this is just the beginning. Now everything
    depends on you. Interpret the knowledge as it is possible to learn and receive
    something only by making attempts. Make first steps in the cryptocurrency market
    using the least risky strategies.

    efforts in this business. You may think that it will be enough for you to press
    the "start" button and money will fall from the sky. If you have already imagined
    yourself sitting by the ocean hoping that the cryptocurrency business will allow
    you to travel all the time without the need to work, you are very wrong. This
    business, like any other, requires that you get off the couch and put your strength,
    brains, and money to work to create a successful future.

    After all, it's those people who believed in Bitcoin a few years ago that now
    have a huge fortune and influence today. Therefore, believe in the dawn of the
    cryptocurrency economy!

- en: First, you shouldn’t take cryptocurrency too seriously. The cryptocurrency market
    is very volatile, and if you do not learn to be easy-going about risks and losses,
    you will drive yourself crazy. It is better to have an easy-going attitude to
    this business from the very beginning. Personally, I think it is impossible to
    survive in the cryptocurrency market without humor, and even a swear wordor two.
    At the same time, do not treat this business as a casino or a lottery. In the
    cryptocurrency market, you need to have a sound strategy and a strong sense of
    purpose.

    already discussed at the very beginning of the book.
