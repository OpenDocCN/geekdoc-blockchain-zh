    enterprises, some of which provide value while others are mere distractions. This
    book aims to not only address the differences between technology distractions
    around blockchain technology but provide insight into why the technology is so
    disruptive to the “status quo” in sectors such as financial, government, and logistics.

    the disruptive nature of blockchain can provide, which entails everything from
    providing your customers direct value through cost savings to ensuring compliance
    requirements are met to providing a competitive edge. Blockchains are driving
    new business models in some sectors faster than others.

    or Dash. It is an enterprise-focused book on blockchain technology. The main focus
    of the book is on Hyperledger, R3 Corda, Quorum, Ripple, and Ethereum. A secondary
    focus is on other technologies that provide value as well such as off-chains like
    Blockstream or smaller blockchain projects such as Lisk or NEO that enterprises
    may be considering. The reality is that blockchains that utilize smart contracts
    provide immense value to enterprises when properly developed, planned, and implemented.
    I also cover in detail how to use IBM Blockchain Platform As A Service and AWS
    Blockchain Templates to drive your customers’ proof of concepts (PoCs) and production
    blockchains.

    deeply involved in a PoC for a Fortune 500 enterprise, learning about the disruptive
    nature of blockchain technology is the right move. Not only should you understand
    that blockchain technology is so disruptive, but that it is also becoming a competitive
    necessity. Your competitors are likely investing in blockchain training, blockchain
    professional services practices, blockchain PoCs, and even enterprise implementations.

    can jump in front of the train or you can jump on board. The question is, do you
    want to be enabled in blockchain or do you prefer to let your competition deal
    with this? The competitive nature of business is clearly driving the hundreds
    of millions in investments in the blockchain space, and this is showing no sign
    of slowing down. Contrary to what the bank CEOs say, blockchain is here to stay
    and will continue to disrupt their businesses.  ## Why You Should Read This Book'

    in documented transactions for companies such as 3PAR Data, HDS Federal (ViON),
    and Brocade Communications, I feel that this target group really needs to understand
    blockchain. The presales audience in some market segments needs to start envisioning
    where their customer base will go around this disruptive technology.
