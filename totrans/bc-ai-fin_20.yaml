    Elevating and becoming more of a strategic partner within the business decision
    making process will require better integration of technology tools, processes,
    and procedures and strategies leveraging technology must become a part of the

    an iteration or step development building on current technologies, blockchain

    from current accounting and finance infrastructure, virtually all of which is
    built around a centralized idea of how information and financial resources flow
    between market actors. Creating a third independent, and community based ledger
    and storage platform for either financial or non-financial data has tremendous
    upside potential for financial services and non-financial services alike. In fact,
    blockchain implementation and adoption has, depending on which report and information
    is cited and documented, accelerated in the non-financial space ahead of the adoption
    in the financial space. Next step applications such as ICOs and DAOs hold virtually
    untapped potential to transform and augment how financial data and information
    passes between providers of credit and the seekers of financial information.

    landscape in terms of automation and efficiency creation, but there are different
    steps and iterations that can be implemented prior to diving full force into the
    AI pool. Robotic process automation is perhaps the most logical first step in
    the automation conversation, but it is important to recognize just what else is
    necessary for automation and efficiency to deliver a true impact to the professional
    landscape. Even with the promise and potential of AI, RPA, or any other of the
    acronym-first technology platforms, it is important to recognize the importance
    of underlying documentation. Put simply, in order to gain the benefits and upsides
    of automation and efficiency by more fully integrating technology solutions current

    will not be able to solve or address the needs, expectations, and requirements
    of marketplace actors. The most advanced and sophisticated technology in existence
    will not be able to solve fundamental business problems, improve the communication
    and dissemination of information between different internal and external groups,
    but will rather augment and accelerate current trends and forces. For example,
    the trend toward short-termism, quarterly reporting, and the expectation of market
    actors to receive information on a nearly continuous basis from organizations
    has, according to many, contributed to the degradation of both business and financial
    decision making. Financial professionals, far from being perceived as possible
    problem solvers and an ability to address this issue, are all too often categorized
    as drivers of the very short termism that has driven the decision making process
    from strategic to tactical.

    are not going to be enough to change or even challenge the status quo with regards

    That said, and made all the more possible by effectively leveraging technology,
    financial professionals will be able to generate and maintain a more effective
    voice at the proverbial table, especially as it links to more effective business
    decision making. This process, the effective leveraging of technology, represents
    both a challenge and an opportunity for financial professionals. Clearly, some
    of these tools are complicated and multi-faceted in nature, but that does not
    mean that mastering them is out of the realm of possibility for professionals.

    the vast quantities of structured information already analyzed by financial professionals,
    and the even larger amounts of unstructured information generated through interactions
    with different stakeholder groups all have an impact on how the organization performs.
    Regardless of the origin of the data, be it operational, financial, nonfinancial,
    or some other type of information, all of it can be quantified, compiled, and
    reported to both internal and external stakeholders. In essence, quantitative
    data drives the decision making process at every level of the organization, and
    financial services professionals are already well versed, trained, and educated
    in doing that exact same thing. Simply acknowledging this reality, however, is
    not enough; financial professionals must also be able to turn this reality into

    the fact that attempting to document and discuss current use trends is always
    going to be challenging simply given the fact that this technology continues to
    move rapidly. Just in 2018 alone the conversation and debate around blockchain
    and cryptocurrencies has evolved from traditional IPOs, to ICOs, to the most current
    iteration of airdropping tokens. Alongside the evolution in the blockchain space
    and area, it is also important to acknowledge the changing nature of the artificial
    intelligence market as well. Even though AI tools, programs, and algorithms are
    already being put into place to help with trading, settling transactions, and
    executing certain confirmations this merely represents the proverbial tip of the
    iceberg. Automation, regardless of the specific subset of the financial services
    market is being analyzed, is coming and is already driving change as to what practitioners
    actually do on a daily basis. As if the underlying technology changes were not
    enough to contend with from an implementation and educational perspective, it
    is also worth pointing out that the entire blockchain-artificial intelligence-cryptocurrency
    ecosystem could be disrupted at any point given the uncertainty with regards to
    regulation and oversight.

    interest and increased motivation to enable effective regulations. While some
    initial or early adopters of different emerging technologies may not be ecstatic
    about this development, the very nature of this technology means that – in essence –
    regulators have no choice in the matter. Powerful as blockchain and artificial
    intelligence are for practitioners and market actors, the implications for regulators
    are equally as powerful for regulatory bodies. In order to remain relevant and
    continuing to add value to the broader conversation, regulators must – and have
    increasingly done so – become well informed, conversant, and able to hold substantive
    conversations with practitioners.

    exception, be focused in the private or consortium based model of blockchain applications.
    Developing these blockchain networks from a technological and programming perspective
    is obviously something that is going to attract quite a bit of attention, but
    there are additional considerations that need to be part of the financial conversation.
    Controls over the custody and transmission of personally identifiable information
    is already something that is becoming an area of focus for practitioners; this
    trend and shift will only continue as digital information becomes more integrated
    into almost every business. As private blockchains continue, at least based on
    market evidence, to obtain and maintain a leading market position, there are also
    additional concerns that need to be factored into the dialogue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the underlying issues that is not normally discussed in the debate and
    analysis surrounding private or consortium blockchain models is that these private
    networks are usually based on the proprietary code of the developing organization.
    For example, if a large organization develops and implements a blockchain model
    for suppliers and partners to utilize, these affiliated organizations are going
    to, in essence, have to use this network. This raises the specter of coding, hacking,
    and other computer issues that are going to have be addressed with any technology
    tools, including blockchain. Especially in the financial services industry, or
    any other industry that has developed sector specific blockchain based models
    or applications, this reliance on proprietary code may actually create a contradictory
    or paradoxical situation. One of the most integral benefits and attributes of
    blockchain technology was the distribution and decentralization of information
    and operation. As these private or consortium models become more and more common,
    this actually may create a situation where – inadvertently or not – blockchain
    based applications shift toward an oligopoly type of model and structure. Practitioners,
    in addition to being able to assist with the development of these platform, must
    also be able to advise and make recommendations based on both the needs of the
    client and the internal expectations of internal stakeholders.

    ecosystem continues to become more refined and developed, is that different industries
    and areas will, almost inevitably, become leaders in the space while others lag
    behind. Particularly in the arena of artificial intelligence there is also a geo-political
    component to any conversation or analysis held by market participants. Organizations,
    corporate partners, and think tank affiliated organizations are clearly investing
    quite a bit of energy and funds into these spaces and arenas, but there are also
    other factors at play in this space. What this means is that, as different regional
    trading blocks continue to monitor each other and keep pace with market developments,
    that regulatory and compliance based approaches are going to also need to evolve.
    Interesting from a conceptual level and political perspective, this also will
    have an effect on the roles and responsibilities of professionals seeking to leverage
    tools such as artificial intelligence and robotic process automation.

    in the marketplace the connection becomes readily apparent. Countries such as
    China have publicly announced nationally supported plans and initiatives to fund
    investments and developments in areas of emerging technology including but not
    limited to AI based platforms. Interesting from a conceptual level, this also
    means that organizations seeking to do business and operate across different national
    and market lines will have to understand the implications of these different sets
    of rules. Much like different stock exchanges have different rules and guidelines
    related to corporate governance and other organizational policies, the implications
    of different AI platforms must also be considered. Linking back to earlier analyses
    within this book, as AI continues to become increasingly integrated within a wide
    array of business applications and platforms there are also programming issues
    that might appear to become more important moving forward.

    technology tools are going to spur the creation and development of new business
    models. As new, potentially decentralized and distributed business models begin
    to enter the marketplace, this is also going to change the nature of how capital
    is raised and allocated between different organizations. Connecting back to the
    entrepreneurial angle raised previously, the sourcing and funding of capital can
    be a potentially impossible roadblock to overcome for entrepreneurs seeking to
    disrupt incumbent firms. Turning a bright light on the financial services sector,
    for example, is it truly surprising to think or forecast that not every financial
    lender or organization is going to eager to fund potential future competition?
    The ability to bypass, with a combination of smart contracts and automated programming,
    traditional sources of financing means that political and established incumbent
    players cannot prevent these organizations from becoming obstacles to the development
    and refinement of these business models.

    healthcare, digital record keeping, royalty management and payment, intellectual
    property valuation and management, and other financially driven applications,
    the fact of the matter is that these technologies are still developing. Keeping
    an eye on different trends, both inside and outside of the financial profession,
    is something all practitioners need to do as these tools move from experimental
    and conceptual to tangible and real world in nature.

- en: One of the most common questions that arises when these topics are discussed,
    especially among financial professionals at organizations that might – and already
    are – being changed and disrupted by the emergence of these emerging technologies
    is where professionals can go to learn more about these topics. Fortunately those
    resources have already been provided earlier in this text, but a more important
    question for practitioners are what areas to keep an eye on moving forward. From
    a client service perspective as well as a firm positioning point of view, remaining
    up to date and current on the forces driving and forcing change in the blockchain
    and cryptocurrency landscape. With so many radically disruptive technologies entering
    the marketplace at the same time it is inevitable that there will be some pushback,
    false starts, and misallocation of capital and other resources during this build
    out and implementation processes. While not meant to be an exhaustive or all inclusive
    listing of areas driving change and, potentially, client questions as it connects
    to the blockchain ecosystem, these include areas that should be monitored for
    changes and developments in 2019, 2020, and beyond.

    different members of the blockchain community, including individuals and institutions
    that are both in favor of increased regulation and those that would like the industry
    to remain – for the most part – outside of too much regulatory oversight. No matter
    the position of an individual professional, an employer firm, or client organizations,
    the reality is that regulation will inevitably come to the blockchain arena. Whether
    it takes the form of state by state legislation such as those underway in Wyoming,
    New York, and others, or the form of national legislation at the federal level,
    keeping an eye on these areas is something that must be taken into account. Outside
    of blockchain, however, regulation and developments around AI must also factored
    into the conversation. This once again raises the important point that, despite
    the excitement and buzz surrounding certain technologies, that these different
    tools seem to be impacting the marketplace all at once.

    opportunity that may very well arise over time is assisting clients with understanding
    the implications of different regulations on how businesses are managed and grown
    over time. While it is also true that such differences may eventually converge
    to a standardized set of reporting and disclosure standards, one needs just to
    look at the different state and local tax structures to realize that is far from
    a given. Especially as the rise of virtual firms and virtual continues to grow
    almost unabated, it is easier than ever before for an organization to operate
    across industry lines. Operating across state, much less national, lines will
    invariably open the organization to questions and other considerations related
    to the different disclosure and reporting requirements connected to blockchain.
    Particularly since the leadership in terms of updated guidance and regulatory
    thought leadership seems to be originating at the state rather than the federal
    level this does seem to indicate a patchwork effect and implementation of regulation
    seems to be the direction it is moving.

    software it is also important to keep an eye on several specific changes, trends,
    and directions that can – and already are – having a direct impact on the financial
    services space at large. In addition to the rather straight forward applications
    and implications outlined throughout this text, it is also important to recognize
    that bigger picture changes and events are already underway. Regulation, shifting
    corporate structures, and the eventual unveiling of codified accounting standards
    are going to have large effects and changes on how these technology tools impact
    banking, accounting, and financial services. Taking a look at both these implications
    as well as the impact that these changes will have on organizations includes,
    but are not limited to, the following.

    end up having the larges potential impact across different areas of the financial
    services profession is the fact that current financial institutions do not appear
    to be fully equipped to handle the burgeoning cryptocurrency marketplace. Trusts
    and banks, obviously, are not going to go away or fade into obscurity; the launching
    of JPM Coin by JP Morgan is simply the latest indication that incumbent financial
    institutions are pivoting into the cryptoasset arena. In addition, the largest
    accounting firms across the global are busy working on standards and policies
    to assist with performing audit, attest, and other assurance related services
    linked to blockchain platforms and cryptocurrencies. That said, these do appear
    to only represent stopgap measures in attempting to solve and address the emerging
    issues connected to blockchain and cryptocurrencies at large. Particularly as
    a result of the work underway in Wyoming, the possibility of new types of organizations
    entering the marketplace is not something that can dismissed out of hand.

    controls at existing institutions, with decades of precedent and legal history,
    but it is an entirely different matter to propose solutions to problems that may
    arise as new types of organizations enter the marketplace. A specialized depository
    organization focusing and developed specifically to handle cryptocurrencies, different
    types of cryptoassets, and to deal with client organizations using blockchain
    as core to business operations will require a number of different considerations.
    Perhaps most clearly are the considerations that need to be developed and refined
    with regards to internal controls over the custody and financial controls over
    different cryptoassets, but that is simply one piece of the conversation. In addition
    to the controls and control policies necessary to be developed to contend with
    these issues are the disclosure requirements that must accompany the changes expectations
    of organizations.

    they are legally mandated to disclose certain classes and types of information,
    it is important to not disclose confidential or proprietary data. Traditional
    controls and processes exist to safeguard the disclosure of information, but as
    the integration of different automation tools become increasingly prevalent it
    does seem logical to expect that different controls are going to have to be developed
    and rolled out over time. Specifically and from a practitioner perspective it
    is evident that controls are going to have to evolve and change alongside the
    changing market forces that are driving blockchain adoption for enterprise utilization.
    For example, and highlighted by the rolling out of different enterprise blockchain
    options and information at some of the largest financial institutions, the accounting
    and finance associations are going to have to evolve and keep pace with the changes
    already underway at different institutions.

    and examine all of the implications and ramifications associated with blockchain,
    robotic process automation, and artificial intelligence. These technology tools
    are potentially going to reshape virtually every aspect of public and private
    life, and must be assessed as the powerful potential change agents that they are.
    Financial services also play a potentially outsized role in the lives of virtually
    every individual, but are also in the midst of several broad changes and disruptive
    trends. Price pressure, increased competition, different applications based on
    these emerging technologies, and increasing regulatory forces are combining to
    rapidly force the somewhat staid financial services field to evolve in relatively
    short order. Whether it is accounting, finance, investment advisory services,
    or lending funds to the marketplace, it does appear that several conclusions and
    future directions are going to have to be assessed and factored into the analysis
    of financial services and metrics moving forward.

- en: Elevating and elevation to strategic advisor and true business partner is something
    that has been discussed, presented, and debated as something that is critically
    important for every professional and organization working in the financial services
    space, but that does not mean that it is a simple or straight forward task. Taking
    into account the reality that virtually every financial professional wants to
    play a more important role in the actual decision making process it is also important
    to recognize that doing so will require a substantial change in how accountants
    and other financial services professionals approach business problems and situations.
    Whether it comes down to developing and refining a different business solving
    headset, analyzing problems from a new perspective, or determining how to leverage
    new and emerging technology tools all represent methods and pieces of information
    that should be taken into account by practitioners. Taking into account that this
    is the end of the core content of this book, the ultimate goal of professional
    are to elevate – both to advise clients ad work inside organization – readers
    should finish this chapter feeling prepared to embrace emerging tools and technology
    to assist clients, retain market position, and provide more value now and going
    forward.
