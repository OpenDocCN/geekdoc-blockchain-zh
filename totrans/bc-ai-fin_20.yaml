- en: One of the underlying issues that is not normally discussed in the debate and
    analysis surrounding private or consortium blockchain models is that these private

    For example, if a large organization develops and implements a blockchain model
    for suppliers and partners to utilize, these affiliated organizations are going
    to, in essence, have to use this network. This raises the specter of coding, hacking,
    and other computer issues that are going to have be addressed with any technology
    tools, including blockchain. Especially in the financial services industry, or
    any other industry that has developed sector specific blockchain based models
    or applications, this reliance on proprietary code may actually create a contradictory
    or paradoxical situation. One of the most integral benefits and attributes of
    blockchain technology was the distribution and decentralization of information
    and operation. As these private or consortium models become more and more common,

    place for accounting professionals to begin the educational and training journey.
    In addition, and even though the association is most clearly affiliated with accounting
    practitioners, it is also developing guidance, programs, and training materials
    for a broader audience. Cybersecurity, blockchain fundamentals, robotic process
    automation, and blockchain for specific industry subsets are just a few of the

    professionals asses and evaluate different medical treatments and diagnostic options.
    While the focus of this book is not specifically on the healthcare sector, it
    is impossible to have a conversation about business applications and implications
    of emerging technologies without mentioning healthcare. At nearly 20% of the U.S.
    economy, any areas or opportunities for process improvement projects to deliver
    improved efficiency or results can, virtually immediately, deliver results and
    benefits that are accretive to the bottom line. For example, and demonstrating
    a potential stacking of different emerging technologies is the following. In the
    greater Boston area alone, there are 26 medical information and enterprise resource
    systems that are used to manage, record, and analyze patient information. Establishing

    quite a bit of energy and funds into these spaces and arenas, but there are also
    other factors at play in this space. What this means is that, as different regional
    trading blocks continue to monitor each other and keep pace with market developments,

    to enter the marketplace, this is also going to change the nature of how capital
    is raised and allocated between different organizations. Connecting back to the
    entrepreneurial angle raised previously, the sourcing and funding of capital can
    be a potentially impossible roadblock to overcome for entrepreneurs seeking to
    disrupt incumbent firms. Turning a bright light on the financial services sector,
    for example, is it truly surprising to think or forecast that not every financial
    lender or organization is going to eager to fund potential future competition?
    The ability to bypass, with a combination of smart contracts and automated programming,
    traditional sources of financing means that political and established incumbent

    it takes the form of state by state legislation such as those underway in Wyoming,
    New York, and others, or the form of national legislation at the federal level,
    keeping an eye on these areas is something that must be taken into account. Outside
    of blockchain, however, regulation and developments around AI must also factored

    opportunity that may very well arise over time is assisting clients with understanding
    the implications of different regulations on how businesses are managed and grown

    to a standardized set of reporting and disclosure standards, one needs just to
    look at the different state and local tax structures to realize that is far from
    a given. Especially as the rise of virtual firms and virtual continues to grow
    almost unabated, it is easier than ever before for an organization to operate
    across industry lines. Operating across state, much less national, lines will
    invariably open the organization to questions and other considerations related
    to the different disclosure and reporting requirements connected to blockchain.
    Particularly since the leadership in terms of updated guidance and regulatory
    thought leadership seems to be originating at the state rather than the federal

  zh: 延续这一思路，随着时间的推移，可能会出现另一项服务和客户咨询机会，即帮助客户了解不同法规对企业管理和发展的影响。尽管有理由相信这些差异最终可能会趋于一致的报告和披露标准，但只需看看不同的州和地方税收结构，就会发现这远非确定之事。特别是随着虚拟公司和虚拟化的不断增长，组织跨行业运营比以往任何时候都更容易。跨越州，更不用说全国，将不可避免地引起组织对与区块链相关的不同披露和报告要求的问题和其他考虑。特别是考虑到更新指导和监管思想领导力似乎是来自州而不是联邦层面，这确实表明了一种混杂效应，监管的实施似乎是它正在前进的方向。

    software it is also important to keep an eye on several specific changes, trends,
    and directions that can – and already are – having a direct impact on the financial
    services space at large. In addition to the rather straight forward applications
    and implications outlined throughout this text, it is also important to recognize
    that bigger picture changes and events are already underway. Regulation, shifting
    corporate structures, and the eventual unveiling of codified accounting standards
    are going to have large effects and changes on how these technology tools impact
    banking, accounting, and financial services. Taking a look at both these implications
    as well as the impact that these changes will have on organizations includes,
    but are not limited to, the following.

  zh: 随着区块链、人工智能和机器人流程自动化等工具的出现，还要注意对金融服务领域产生直接影响的几个特定变化、趋势和发展方向。除了本文中概述的相当直接的应用和影响之外，还需要认识到已经正在进行的更全局性的变化和事件。法规、不断变化的公司结构以及最终公布的编码会计准则将对这些技术工具影响银行业、会计和金融服务产生重大影响和变化。审视这些影响以及这些变化对组织的影响包括但不限于以下内容。
- en: One of the largest changes that may be flying under the radar, but may actually
    end up having the larges potential impact across different areas of the financial
    services profession is the fact that current financial institutions do not appear
    to be fully equipped to handle the burgeoning cryptocurrency marketplace. Trusts
    and banks, obviously, are not going to go away or fade into obscurity; the launching
    of JPM Coin by JP Morgan is simply the latest indication that incumbent financial
    institutions are pivoting into the cryptoasset arena. In addition, the largest
    accounting firms across the global are busy working on standards and policies
    to assist with performing audit, attest, and other assurance related services
    linked to blockchain platforms and cryptocurrencies. That said, these do appear
    to only represent stopgap measures in attempting to solve and address the emerging
    issues connected to blockchain and cryptocurrencies at large. Particularly as
    a result of the work underway in Wyoming, the possibility of new types of organizations
    entering the marketplace is not something that can dismissed out of hand.

  zh: 可能悄悄进行的最大变化之一，但实际上可能在金融服务行业的不同领域产生很大影响的事实是，当前的金融机构似乎并不完全具备处理蓬勃发展的加密货币市场的能力。信托和银行显然不会消失或逐渐淡出人们的视线；摩根大通推出JPM币只是现任金融机构进军加密资产领域的最新迹象。此外，全球最大的会计事务所正忙于制定标准和政策，以协助进行与区块链平台和加密货币相关的审计、证明和其他保证服务。尽管如此，这些似乎只是试图解决并应对与区块链和加密货币大规模有关的新兴问题的权宜之计。特别是由于怀俄明州正在进行的工作，新类型的组织进入市场的可能性不容忽视。
- en: It is one thing to monitor the conversation and dialogue related to internal
    controls at existing institutions, with decades of precedent and legal history,
    but it is an entirely different matter to propose solutions to problems that may
    arise as new types of organizations enter the marketplace. A specialized depository
    organization focusing and developed specifically to handle cryptocurrencies, different
    types of cryptoassets, and to deal with client organizations using blockchain
    as core to business operations will require a number of different considerations.
    Perhaps most clearly are the considerations that need to be developed and refined
    with regards to internal controls over the custody and financial controls over
    different cryptoassets, but that is simply one piece of the conversation. In addition
    to the controls and control policies necessary to be developed to contend with
    these issues are the disclosure requirements that must accompany the changes expectations
    of organizations.

  zh: 监测与现有机构内部控制相关的对话和对话，具有几十年的先例和法律历史，这是一回事，但提出解决新类型组织进入市场可能出现的问题则完全是另一回事。一家专门的存款机构专注于处理加密货币、不同类型的加密资产，并与使用区块链作为核心业务运营的客户组织打交道，需要考虑许多不同的因素。也许最明显的是需要开发和完善的是关于监管和财务控制加密资产不同方面的内部控制，但这只是谈话的一部分。除了需要开发的控制和控制政策来应对这些问题外，还必须伴随组织变化期望的披露要求。
- en: Disclosures are a tricky business for financial professionals because while
    they are legally mandated to disclose certain classes and types of information,
    it is important to not disclose confidential or proprietary data. Traditional
    controls and processes exist to safeguard the disclosure of information, but as
    the integration of different automation tools become increasingly prevalent it
    does seem logical to expect that different controls are going to have to be developed
    and rolled out over time. Specifically and from a practitioner perspective it
    is evident that controls are going to have to evolve and change alongside the
    changing market forces that are driving blockchain adoption for enterprise utilization.
    For example, and highlighted by the rolling out of different enterprise blockchain
    options and information at some of the largest financial institutions, the accounting
    and finance associations are going to have to evolve and keep pace with the changes
    already underway at different institutions.

  zh: 对金融专业人士来说，披露是一项棘手的任务，因为虽然法律要求他们披露某些类别和类型的信息，但重要的是不要披露机密或专有数据。传统的控制和流程旨在保护信息的披露，但随着不同自动化工具的整合日益普遍，似乎合乎逻辑地期望各种不同的控制随时间发展并逐步推出。特别是从实践者的角度来看，很明显，控制将不得不与推动企业利用区块链的不断变化的市场力量一起发展和变化。例如，正如一些最大金融机构推出不同的企业区块链选项和信息所突显的那样，会计和金融协会将不得不跟上不同机构正在进行的变革。
- en: It is beyond the scope of this text, or any other text for that matter, to illustrate
    and examine all of the implications and ramifications associated with blockchain,
    robotic process automation, and artificial intelligence. These technology tools
    are potentially going to reshape virtually every aspect of public and private
    life, and must be assessed as the powerful potential change agents that they are.
    Financial services also play a potentially outsized role in the lives of virtually
    every individual, but are also in the midst of several broad changes and disruptive
    trends. Price pressure, increased competition, different applications based on
    these emerging technologies, and increasing regulatory forces are combining to
    rapidly force the somewhat staid financial services field to evolve in relatively
    short order. Whether it is accounting, finance, investment advisory services,
    or lending funds to the marketplace, it does appear that several conclusions and
    future directions are going to have to be assessed and factored into the analysis
    of financial services and metrics moving forward.

  zh: 第18章总结
- en: Elevating and elevation to strategic advisor and true business partner is something
    that has been discussed, presented, and debated as something that is critically
    important for every professional and organization working in the financial services
    space, but that does not mean that it is a simple or straight forward task. Taking
    into account the reality that virtually every financial professional wants to
    play a more important role in the actual decision making process it is also important
    to recognize that doing so will require a substantial change in how accountants
    and other financial services professionals approach business problems and situations.
    Whether it comes down to developing and refining a different business solving
    headset, analyzing problems from a new perspective, or determining how to leverage
    new and emerging technology tools all represent methods and pieces of information
    that should be taken into account by practitioners. Taking into account that this
    is the end of the core content of this book, the ultimate goal of professional
    are to elevate – both to advise clients ad work inside organization – readers
    should finish this chapter feeling prepared to embrace emerging tools and technology
    to assist clients, retain market position, and provide more value now and going
    forward.
