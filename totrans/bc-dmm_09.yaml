- en: The Factom blockchain is a powerful tool that will help industry scale blockchain
    technology. It’s different from other public blockchains and has unique properties
    that make it ideal for publishing data streams and securing systems. The Factom
    blockchain also has a corporation behind it — Factom, Inc. — which spearheads
    its development and builds tools and products on top of the protocol.

- en: Factom software is being built into systems that govern identity and security
    of both people and things. They’re integrating and bridging other blockchains
    and blockchain technology as well. The linking between blockchains improves the
    security of Factom and makes the other blockchains more interoperable.

    Factom blockchain technology and know where it will add value to your blockchain

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchains at their core are about allowing different entities to cooperate
    and collaborate without needing to trust each other’s data security or business
    processes. Historically, trusted middlemen or industry consortiums have enabled
    this to happen, but those have high overhead costs and merely shift the trust
    to a different party. Blockchains shift the trust to a network of disimpassioned
    third parties and, ultimately, math.

- en: Factom, Inc., is a company that builds blockchain software on top of the open-access
    Factom blockchain. Factom’s recordkeeping software works at a high level by publishing
    encrypted data or a cryptographically unique fingerprint of that data to the Factom
    blockchain (shown in [Figure 7-1](#c07-fig-0001)). Additional measures are taken
    to secure the network by publishing a hash of the whole Factom blockchain every
    ten minutes in multiple other public blockchains. This extra publishing feature
    makes Factom different from most public blockchains.

- en: The concept of the protocol was presented as a whitepaper in 2014 to address
    scalability issues of Bitcoin. As decentralized applications began securing themselves
    in Bitcoin, it became clear that entering data into the Bitcoin blockchain was
    prohibitively expensive at scale, and the Bitcoin couldn’t handle high transactional
    volumes. There was no way to metaphorically get 10 pounds of data into the 5-pound
    Bitcoin bag.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Factom protocol was designed to address the cost and volume limitations
    of other blockchains. The primary objective was to secure data and systems. Because
    of this objective, Factom is often described as a *publishing engine.* It allows
    users to write data to its ledger for a small fee. These entries are limited to
    10 kibibytes and have a fixed cost that is less expensive and has more capacity
    for transaction volume by an order of magnitude compared to blockchains that use
    proof of work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An important concept to understand is that the Factom blockchain is built in
    layers and chains. The layers have to do with how the data is structured. They
    use Merkle trees to leave cryptographic proof that any given data was published
    within Factom. The cryptographic proof, called a *Merkle root* (32 random characters
    that can represent a whole tree of individual data), is then published into other
    public blockchains like Ethereum. This is redundant security that other blockchains
    don’t offer.

- en: '![technicalstuff](images/technicalstuff.png) A Merkle tree is a mathematical
    tree constructed by hashing paired data and then pairing and hashing the results

    to only pull the data that they’re interested in from the Factom blockchain, without
    needing to download the full data set. How they work is very simple: You can publish
    your data into an existing chain within Factom, or you can create a new chain.
    The chain ID is then used in the subsequent items you publish as a way to trace
    back the data you care about.'

- en: Factom is a publishing platform. At its core, it was designed to publish and
    validate any data. All other tools on it are built around these simple functionalities.
    Factom can handle transactions that are up to 10 kibibytes; larger transactions
    need special structuring and require multiple entries. Alternatively, a hash that
    represents the data can also be published.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because the Factom protocol is open source, the system acts as a public utility.
    It’s a place where anyone can publish anything and be secured by the Factom blockchain.
    Not surprisingly, some individuals have published obscene content, but the limit
    on entry size means they can’t publish much. And spam is curbed in the system
    by charging a small amount per entry. So if you want to swear in the blockchain,
    it’ll cost you.

- en: Factoids are the Factom network cryptocurrency. Decentralized systems need a
    reward mechanism to incentivize participants. Having this closed system requires
    cooperation, and builds the long-term network value creation. Factoids can be
    traded and purchased like any of the other 700 cryptocurrencies on the cryptocurrency
    market. In the end, Factoids are used to purchase entry credits for the Factom
    Network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cost of an entry is fixed, while the cost of a *Factoid* fluctuates. As
    a Factoid increases in value, the user can buy more entry credits. This system
    allows users to be separated from tradable tokens and maintains fixed cost for
    consumers while allowing for a free market on the speculation of Factoids. This
    functionality was built into the initial release of Factom to allow heavily regulated
    industries and governments to utilize blockchain technology without dirtying their
    hands with tradable tokens.

    to smart contracts or to prove history.

- en: Many blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, use a “proof of work” consensus.
    In this kind of a blockchain, the consensus algorithm is how a blockchain comes
    to agreement on new data entered into the system. The consensus system examines
    whether new data is valid. Public blockchains need a robust system because anyone
    can add data to a blockchain. Their consensus mechanism is the rule set that determines
    what makes a block valid and what chain should be trusted.
  prefs: []

- en: Proof of work has many characteristics that make it very attractive. It can
    often require a capital investment into specialized computer hardware and access
    to electricity (the cheaper, the better). This means that the only requirement
    to join as an authority in the system is to burn electricity with commodity hardware.
    It also means that in order to rewrite history, an equivalent amount of energy
    must be re-burned. This expense makes rewriting history unprofitable and, thus,
    unlikely.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Proof of work is excellent at securing blockchains. On the other hand, it consumes
    vast sums of energy and is expensive to operate. It’s a cannibalistic arms race
    where the fastest computers win, and each additional gigahash added to the network
    increases the challenge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more data contained in each block, the more difficult it is to validate.
    Proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin also requires the full blockchain to validate
    a specific data point in the system. For others to prove the transaction you made
    in the Bitcoin blockchain is valid, they must have all of Bitcoin’s blockchain
    downloaded. Currently, that takes several days.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Factom steps back from the question, “Is an entry valid?” The question instead
    is, “Has the entry been paid for?” The users of the system are the ones validating
    entries. Factom also structures data in subchains that can be parsed individually
    to prove the validity of any entry without downloading the full blockchain.
