    is only just beginning to understand the ramifications, opportunities and dangers
    of the concepts unleashed. From digital identity to the use of cryptocurrencies

    and purported to be the moral underpinning of a banker’s relationship with her

- en: Blockchain technology at its heart is a tool for interaction between people
    and entities. Mathematics and computer code form the mechanism through which information
    can be autonomously authenticated. It provides the particpants with confidence
    that the information in a transaction is beyond the influence of any one person
    or entity. When corrupted, the data breach is there for all to see. With this
    level of transparency and traceability, there is no longer a need to know a counterparty,
    nor to involve any mutually trusted institution. Trust is in the code that underlies
    the system.

    in the modern economy are built. The traditional expectation is that third-party
    intermediaries —government agencies, banks, audit firms and the like—provide verification
    and assurance to transacting parties. And this is where the system breaks down,
    particularly in developing economies. For transactions to be worthwhile to the
    third parties, they must be scalable to extract value. That becomes particularly
    difficult when serving poorer rural communities. The present system has been good
    enough until now in the developed world. Blockchain is showing that a better mechanism
    for trust may exist for the developing world at least.

    early twentieth centuries as stock markets were emerging, ownership was proven
    by physical share certificates. Transactions were consummated by physically delivering
    these certificates between counterparties. This soon became cumbersome, and so
    runners were hired to ferry certificates from one party to the other, first on
    foot, then by bicycle. Given the physicality of this system, transactions in equities
    became concentrated in certain cities—most notably, New York . With growth of
    the stock market, this system too ultimately became too cumbersome, and so the
    US system we use today emerged, whereby all stock certificates are owned by one
    little-known entity. Cede & Co and its parent, the Depository Trust and Clearing
    Corporation (DTCC  ), are entrusted to maintain an electronic ledger of who owns
    which stocks, providing efficiency to the system and negating the need for physical
    transfer.

    verified and stored cryptographically to reduce certain risks—such as confiscation,
    censorship or exposure to third-party solvency. It also comprehensively assigns
    both liability and sovereignty to the transaction counterparties. The change in
    risk culture required is explicit. With the transaction flow being defined by
    code and consensus algorithms rather than traditional intermediaries and regulations,
    the institutional liability arrangements on which we have relied for decades are
    no longer compatible. This requires total adjustment in our understanding of risk.

    normally perceived as inherently riskier and by those less encumbered by an existing
    infrastructure of risk control. While eliminating risk is clearly impossible,
    this nevertheless continues to be a common regulatory and organizational objective
    in the developed world. By contrast, culture in developing countries accepts the
    inevitability of a certain degree of risk.

    of risk. And there is a valid argument that rather than seeking to minimize risk,
    humans naturally adjust their behavior to optimize the outcomes for given level
    of risk. This is the theory of risk homeostasis , which originated in research
    seeking to understand why road traffic fatalities didn’t seem to fall as cars
    became safer. Researchers found that motorists have a particular level of risk
    that they are willing to tolerate rather than a particular outcome that they are
    seeking to achieve with minimum required risk. When cars become safer, motorists
    compensate by taking greater risks on the road, allowing them to optimize the
    outcome of their driving within their risk envelope.^([3](#Fn3)) For example,
    by driving faster in a safer car, a driver experiences the same risk as they would
    driving slower in a less safe car, but with the added benefit of arriving sooner
    or having a more thrilling journey. Although risk and protection have many more
    layers in any large and complex organization, individual behavior and risk appetite
    still play a major role.^([4](#Fn4)) The dynamics of homeostasis are self-evident
    among professional risk takers, such as investors or insurers.^([5](#Fn5))

    A new technology that simplifies verification, and thereby reduces risk , is more
    likely to be utilized. By reducing the risk of one component of a transaction
    (verification), this allows counterparties to tolerate greater risk in other aspects
    of a transaction, such as self-sovereignty—thereby increasing economic activity.
