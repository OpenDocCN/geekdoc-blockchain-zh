    stimulate an individual’s brain with happy experiences indistinguishable from
    experiences in the “real” world. Nozick asked a question: “If given a choice,
    would we choose the machine over reality?” In 1999, the sci-fi movie Matrix raised
    a similar question: red pill or blue pill? Pop the red pill and wake up in the
    real world where you see the world is just a simulation created by the Matrix,
    or swallow the blue pill and teleport to the virtual Matrix plot? The Metaverse
    concept is similar to the Matrix, where the real and virtual worlds merge in the
    “future version of the Internet.”'

    Snow Crash’s main character, a katana-wielding hacker called Hiro Protagonist,

    degrees horizontally and slightly more than 180 degrees vertically. A human typically
    can see a 200–220-degree arc around their head. The overlap of the same scene
    from a human’s left and right eyes is around 114 degrees, which we can see in
    3D. This FOV is necessary for a human brain to calculate depth perception. In
    the case of virtual reality, FOV means how much of the virtual world a participant
    can see around them simultaneously. The VR headsets camera simulates human eye
    positions and a defined FOV degree that people can expect. The headsets also have
    gyroscopic sensors to track how you’re moving, adjust your view, and enable you
    to explore 360-degree scenes. All of these will greatly improve the fully immerses
    experience. Most VR headsets today generally support 114-degree 3d vision space

- en: Frame rate/FPS (frames per second) defines the speed at which the Graphics Processing
    Unit (GPU) can process an image per second. Frame rate is related to resolution,
    which shows the amount of detail in the image over time. For example, with a frame
    rate of 50 FPS, you will see 50 samples in one second. In the next second, it
    will show another 50 samples. Suppose an object moves with your view. In that
    case, you will only see those 50 samples updated position per second. Other samples
    will be invisible to you between those snapshots. If you increase the frame rate
    to 500 FPS, you will get ten times more samples every second. The result will
    be much better imagery, smoother motion, and a more immersive experience. A lower
    frame rate will typically have worse effects. Studies have shown that anything
    less than 60 FPS causes feelings of disorientation, nausea, and other negative
    side effects in the user. VR developers typically aim for a minimum of 60 FPS–90
    FPS.

    commerce software tools will appear. As a result, the number of designers and
    creators on the Metaverse is increasing exponentially. For example, tokens like
    NFTs, build on a decentralized blockchain and have provable ownership for the
    digital asset with independent centralized platforms. This new model will give
    creators more influence than the traditional creator platform. Creators can build
    their Metaverse economies, sell more virtual NFT items to fans, and have opportunities

    trade the product using cryptocurrency and transfer NFT ownership. Decentralized
    finance (DeFi) is a way to provide financial products into the Metaverse via a

    can come in all sorts of different forms, such as weapons, characters, skins,
    pets, food, tools, and virtual land, to be used as part of the game. Once players
    have collected them, they can be exchanged for other assets within the game or
    sold for actual money on a real-world NFT marketplace. Players create value for
    the entire game system by participating in the in-game economy. For example, in
    one of the most popular blockchain games, Axie Infinity, there are creatures called
    Axis. Axis is a fictional, fierce creature that loves to battle, build, and hunt
    for treasure. The player can collect, trade, and raise Axis and use it to battle,
    other players and enemies. The Axie as a game asset is defined as ERC-721 NFT

    where the owner can either keep the NFT or sell it directly to a buyer at an agreed-upon
    price in marketplaces. Buyers can directly pay with cryptocurrency or use a mortgage
    to purchase land. The virtual landowner will keep the assets in their wallet and

    and discovery layer is likely to see the most activity. A virtual world consisting
    of a large-scale human society with a fully digital representation of the physical

    and many other services in the real world, are connected or migrated to the virtual
    world. The population and activities of the virtual world continue to expand further,

    achieves a virtual universe depicted at the “Oasis” level in the 2018 movie “Ready

    Sword Art Online in 2009—describes a virtual reality experience where a person
    fully “dives in” to the virtual world and becomes disconnected from the actual
    physical reality; in a sense, it would almost be like teleportation.
