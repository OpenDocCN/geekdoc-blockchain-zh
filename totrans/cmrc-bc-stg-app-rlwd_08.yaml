- en: Blockchain as a marketplace is a very interesting concept, which I have thought
    long and hard about. On the one hand, a marketplace built on Blockchain technology
    makes complete sense – after all Blockchain is about decentralization and removing
    the middlemen. On the other hand, marketplaces today are globally complex beasts,
    which need significant management and administration. For that reason, I am not
    putting marketplaces into my use cases, as I do believe this is a fundamental
    foundation of Blockchain technology use cases.

    to improve the current marketplaces (trust, transparency, and immutability) and

    with marketing, seller on-boarding, and customer service.

    could be used to check certain information and the use of customer feedback would
    be critical. This, again, could easily be automated via smart contracts, enabling
