- en: Today, cryptocurrencies are getting more and more attention from investors,
    regulators, governments and media outlets alike, and therefore there is a requirement
    for a sound understanding of the economic and financial dynamics of these new
    assets. This book offers a broad range of chapters on varying topics of cryptocurrencies
    and acts as a foundation for anyone interested in these new assets and seeks to
    understand the issues and challenges of investing in these new, interesting and
    volatile markets. More importantly, this book will give you a solid understanding
    of important elements of cryptocurrencies, as well as clear overview of the current
    academic understanding of these assets.

    and challenging the traditional financial system. First introduced by Satoshi
    Nakamoto in his 2008 white paper, Bitcoin has grown into the most popular cryptocurrency
    as well as a global phenomenon. The technology behind Bitcoin (and most cryptocurrencies)
    is blockchain and a recent survey by Deloitte found that 53% of respondents say
    that blockchain technology has become a critical priority for their organizations
    in 2019 while 83% see compelling use cases for blockchain.[¹](#fn_1) The Financial
    Times reports that business schools around the world are racing to offer lessons
    in blockchain and bitcoin and Professor Campbell Harvey stresses the need for
    students to engage with popular cryptocurrencies.[²](#fn_2)

    services has grown from 16% in 2015 to 33% in 2017, and in 2019 it went as high
    as 64%. Furthermore, the awareness of FinTech grown significantly, and in 2019
    around 96% of consumers are aware of at least one form of FinTech service available.
    Particularly, awareness of cryptocurrency has also increased in the recent years.
    The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) examined the reasons of the popularity of
    cryptocurrency assets amongst consumers and the potential risks that this technology
    can cause. In October 2018, the FCA published a joint report with the Bank of
    England and HM Treasury, providing the main definitions and description of different
    categories of digital assets, and current regulatory perimeter.[⁴](#fn_4) Together
    with Revealing Reality research firm, the FCA published a report based on 31 qualitative
    interviews with cryptocurrency consumers shading the light on main motivations,
    beliefs and attitudes of cryptocurrency users. Findings show that majority of
    respondents decided to buy cryptocurrencies following advice received from a friend
    or family member. It is interesting insight that consumers relied on family advice,
    or in some particular cases advice from taxi drivers, and not the advice of professional
    advisors or analysts, which indicates the power of word-of-mouth as a main channel
    of popularity of this investment assets. Would consumers be encouraged to invest
    in ETFs, derivatives, or other new investments assets, following family advice?
    Hard to tell, but probably not. This highlights the very unique features of the
    cryptocurrency phenomenon, that regardless the complexity of technology behind
    it, that undoubtedly is quite hard to understand by any regular consumer, the
    idea behind it seems to be mass appealing and exciting for uniformed investors
    and users. Furthermore, the role of media and social media in disseminating information
    about digital currencies was crucial.

    some of the majority of consumers indicate that social media play a key role in
    their decision to purchase a digital asset. However, according to the FCA survey
    conducted in December 2018 among 2,132 participants (70%) have not heard of cryptocurrencies
    or did not know what are they, and only 3% have bought cryptocurrency before.
    Among those who purchased cryptocurrency 8% completed ‘deep research’ before purchasing,
    while 16% conducted no research at all before purchasing.[⁵](#fn_5) The results
    of the survey conducted in December 2018 by Coinbase,[⁶](#fn_6) and published
    in June 2019, provides evidence of increased awareness of cryptocurrencies in
    the US. Particularly, 58% of Americans responded that they heard of Bitcoin, where
    the word *“Bitcoin”* was more popular search on Google than “*royal wedding*”
    or “*election results*”.[⁷](#fn_7) Considering the fact that both surveys were
    conducted in the same time, we can conclude that awareness of cryptocurrencies
    was higher in the US than in the UK. So cryptocurrencies, what are they? There
    are many definitions of cryptocurrencies are available online, in this volume,
    we use the following generic definition of cryptocurrencies:'

    into traditional currencies, makes cryptocurrencies very attractive for investors
    around the globe. There are several types of cryptocurrencies that can be distinguished.
    According to above mentioned *Cryptoassets Taskforce* report by FCA, Bank of England,
    and HM Treasury, cryptoassets include: (i) exchange tokens; (ii) security tokens;
    and (iii) utility tokens, where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin belong to the first
    group of the exchange tokens, and are primarily being used as a means of exchange
    or as an investment. Different categorisations is provided by [Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_003)
    ([2020](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_003)) who allocated all digital assets into three
    categories: (i) currencies; (ii) blockchains/protocols; (iii) decentralised apps,
    where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin also belong to the first group since their
    primarily role is money transfer. Overall, we can note that both classifications
    determine cryptocurrencies in the category of digital assets that have main function,
    such as transfer of funds, storage of value, and investment opportunities. One
    of the first debates in the academic literature was around the role cryptocurrencies
    play in the financial system, whether cryptocurrencies are a new form of money
    and can store value, or they are a new class of highly speculative investment
    assets. These debates we widely discussed in the media, and many suggested that
    true value of Bitcoin is zero (e. g. [Cheah and Fry](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_001)
    ([2015](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_001))). However, late in 2017 when Bitcoin price
    skyrocketed from $1000 to nearly $20,000, further discussion of the true value
    of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was emerging ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_004),
    [2018a](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_004)). With time, academics started looking at
    cryptoassets differently, by noticing the fact that investors who hold substantial
    sums of Bitcoins are not cashing out their positrons, indicating their strong
    belief that regardless of regulatory uncertainty, ethical considerations and a
    variety of environmental issues, cryptocurrencies still can store the value over
    time and Bitcoin especially is a valuable asset to hold in longer term.'

    research. While quite a detailed literature survey has been provided by [Corbet

    already, this chapter offers more up-to-date review of the literature in this
    field, particularly, it highlights the main networks of cryptocurrency scholars
    and research groups that are leading the research in this field. Authors took
    into consideration several indicators like geographic location of the research
    teams and their institutions, number of published articles on cryptocurrencies
    and related topics, and last but not the least, amount of citations that each
    of the published manuscripts were able to generate over relatively short period
    of time after publications. This displays how rapidly cryptocurrency research
    evolved in the last few years, and provides some idea how to cryptocurrency scholars
    can collaborate to further advance this innovative field of finance.

    technological details of Blockchain and distributed ledger technology that cryptocurrencies
    are based on. If you just started your cryptocurrencies journey, after reading
    of the next chapter you will be able to find answer on several important questions,
    such as what is a double spending problem, mining, and proof-of-work algorithm?
    This chapter discussed the existing problems of Blockchain technology, such as
    scalability, oracle problem, and fork. It is a new and exciting technology, innovation
    that potential will destruct the financial services and other businesses, therefore
    a good understanding of Blockchain is important to successfully adopt to technological
    changes and use the applications of Blockchain that might be most relevant for
    your business or research. In comparison to various previous literature that covers
    technological aspect of cryptocurrencies, this chapter explains it in more accessible
    manner, that makes it easier to understand the technology and main terminology

    (ICOs), and provides insightful examples of ICOs misusage, such as questionable
    motives of ICOs, criminality and ICO disappearance. The cases considered in this
    chapter received were discussed widely in the media, however, they are also important
    from theoretical perspectives, and provide interesting avenue for corporate finance
    researchers, and broader range of finance and business scholars. For example,
    when Kodak announced the release of their KODAKCoin, there was an immediate and
    significant price rise of Kodak shares, while after the announcement there was
    increased correlation between the price of Kodak shares and Bitcoin ([Corbet et al.](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_002),
    [2019](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_002)). Further examples includes Facebook and
    Libra cryptocurrency, as well as Venezuelan Petro. This discussion will be particularly
    interesting for cryptocurrency-enthusiasts who are dedicated to promote the potential
    of the new technology, since this chapter highlights that entire sector has been
    susceptible to various frauds and scams that cannot be ignored. It concludes with
    comments on ICOs regulation.

    of cryptocurrency markets. This commentary and non-academic point of view on cryptocurrencies
    adds a great value to this volume, stimulating a dialog between practitioners
    and academics in the areas that are of great importance, such as business ethics.
    Also, there are regulatory issues as cryptocurrencies have been found to be used
    for illegal activities and the huge price fall of Bitcoin once the website Silk
    Road was taken down by the FBI 2013 [Foley et al.](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_006)
    ([2019](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_006)). Further, the Mt.Gox collapse in 2014 with
    over 650,000 Bitcoins stolen with an estimated value of $450 million at the time
    has led to many trust issues. A good understanding of legal and policy implications
    of cryptocurrency markets is essential for anyone who wants to participate in
    it as an investor or service provider.

    volume that focused on the market structure of cryptocurrencies, and explains
    how the cryptocurrencies are being trade. It provides details on existing types
    of exchanges, highlighting the differences between centralized and decentralized
    exchanges, and what can happen if the exchange will get hacked. This chapter is
    important read for everyone who is planning to invest in cryptocurrencies, or
    plan to conduct research in this area, but not yet understand the cryptocurrency
    exchanges mechanism. Cryptocurrency derivatives are also discussed, as a new investment
    assets and growing area of research. Furthermore, this section present an overview
    of the key issues of cryptocurrency trading, such as undercutting, short selling
    constraints, front running and griefing. Indeed, this is a useful read if you
    want to understand cryptocurrency trading better.

    of cryptocurrencies, its statistical properties, explosivity, volatility, and
    interconnectedness with other more traditional financial markets. In this chapter
    cryptocurrencies considered as an investment assets, and it is a useful read for
    investors interested to include cryptocurrencies in their investment portfolio.
    For instance, a recent paper by [Platanakis and Urquhart](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_007)
    ([2020](#b_9783110660807-001_ref_007)) shows that including Bitcoin in a well
    diversified portfolio consisting of bonds, stocks and commodities significantly
    improves the risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio. However cryptocurrencies
    are not without their controversies such as the unstable volatility. This is a
    major issue with all cryptocurrencies being accepted as a form of payment since
    the price can change dramatically on any given day. This is also an excellent
    direction for academic research, and opportunity to contribute to contagion, portfolio
    theory and diversification literature.

    Bitcoin and the US technology stock returns. This paper used daily data covering
    the period 18 August 2011 to 15 April 2019 and Granger causality in moments methodology
    providing an evidence of a relationship between Bitcoin and US tech stock indices.
    This chapter is useful particularly for students and early career researchers
    who want to conduct the research in this area, since it clearly displays methodological
    details and results, as well demonstrate how the academic study should be structured
    and presented. This is also useful for a broad range of practitioners, and academics
    working in this area, since they are in continuous search of the methods to predict
    the Bitcoin prices. As a cryptocurrency market leader Bitcoin influence prices
    of other cryptocurrencies, therefore by predicting Bitcoin price and understanding
    which factors determine it investors can predict the behaviour of the cryptocurrency
    markets.

    caused increased of energy consumption of this sector which might results in wider
    environmental implications. The penultimate chapter discuss the environmental
    aspects of cryptocurrency markets, addressing the issue whether cryptocurrencies
    are a contributor to the climate problem. It is not very popular topic among cryptocurrency-enthusiasts,
    however, this issue concern public and the media, since it become increasingly
    important for consumers to understand the climate implications of the new technology
    before actually using it. By including this chapter to the volume we are making
    a statement that climate change issues should no longer be ignored by finance
    community, and climate finance area in general has a great importance. The impact
    of cryptocurrency energy consumption and growing FinTech adoption on environment,
    should be thoroughly investigated by researchers to provide evidence for policy
    makers and regulators alike to introduce necessary legislation to this area.
