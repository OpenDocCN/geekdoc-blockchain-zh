- en: The series “Studies in Big Data” (SBD) publishes new developments and advances
    in the various areas of Big Data- quickly and with a high quality. The intent
    is to cover the theory, research, development, and applications of Big Data, as
    embedded in the fields of engineering, computer science, physics, economics and
    life sciences. The books of the series refer to the analysis and understanding
    of large, complex, and/or distributed data sets generated from recent digital
    sources coming from sensors or other physical instruments as well as simulations,
    crowd sourcing, social networks or other internet transactions, such as emails
    or video click streams and other. The series contains monographs, lecture notes
    and edited volumes in Big Data spanning the areas of computational intelligence
    including neural networks, evolutionary computation, soft computing, fuzzy systems,
    as well as artificial intelligence, data mining, modern statistics and Operations
    research, as well as self-organizing systems. Of particular value to both the
    contributors and the readership are the short publication timeframe and the world-wide
    distribution, which enable both wide and rapid dissemination of research output.

- en: Cyber threats increase as firms, governments and consumers rely on digital systems
    for their day-to-day activities. The more they adopt the technologies, the higher
    the risks they face. Additionally, new solutions to facilitate everyday businesses,
    such as artificial intelligence for operational systems and enormous IT databases,
    create complexity. However, these new technologies can also be their most reliable
    allies! They can provide new protection levels that make a strong shield of protection
    against hackers if properly designed and integrated. There is growth in IoT use,
    which increases the risk for organizations and the need for data protection policies.
    Organizations are not taking enough steps to secure themselves from cyber-attacks;
    ultimately, there will be an increase in attack size and volume.
