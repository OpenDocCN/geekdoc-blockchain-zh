    break them down. Like other Internet companies, Blockchain startups also attach
    great importance to talent and strategies. Strategies lead to products, and products
    win the market, then the market captures users, and ultimately income and profits
    are generated. However, compared to other Internet companies, Blockchain startups
    have more urgent demands and higher requirements for outstanding talents. The
    people who are needed to explore the rapidly evolving Blockchain technology are
    those who are perseverant and bold, but also cautious and unafraid to take risks.
    A good Blockchain company is itself a network of value nodes, and various kinds
    of professionals who have expertise in product development, testing, marketing,
    and business operations are all indispensable. The primary task for the COO is
    to continuously spot talented people and form an excellent team to ensure the
    company’s healthy development.

- en: The first time that I heard the word Blockchain was probably in early 2013\.
    As a person engaged in the research and development of Internet technology, I
    read all the Chinese and English materials available at the time with immense
    curiosity. Although limited by my English level, I still wanted to understand
    the principles of Blockchain technology in an authentic way. Today, everyone regards
    Blockchain as a kind of technology, and at that time I also believed that it must
    possess some characteristics of technology. So from this perspective, I further
    studied this so-called “technology.” Below, I will talk about my understanding
    of Blockchain following the three steps of learning, namely, what, why, and how.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, what is Blockchain? Currently, all mainstream media are talking
    about Blockchain, defining it as a technology. I don’t quite agree with this definition;
    instead, I believe that Blockchain, a new thing, is more like a set of solutions
    for credit problems. It is common knowledge that currently there are only several
    credit systems in the world. First is the system based on morality, which is to
    solve credit problems by way of moral constraints. For example, when we have meals
    in restaurants, because of information asymmetry, we do not know whether the restaurants
    use gutter oil or unhealthy ingredients, but we choose to trust the restaurants’
    owners and believe that they will not do anything harmful to the physical and
    mental health of their customers. The second system is based on beliefs. I once
    heard a joke that problems concerning food safety rarely occur in the West, and
    one of the important reasons is that people engaged in food production are afraid
    of God’s punishment. Since everyone believes in God and that God is a fair judge,
    a credit system has been established based on such a belief. The third system
    is based on government. When it comes to government, we have to talk about the
    banking system of every country in the world. It can be said that they are all
    based on government. Every citizen believes that his or her government will not
    collapse and that at any time, a government is a strong backing for its people.
    As long as the government remains intact, the figures in people’s bank accounts
    have value and can act as a medium for commodity exchange.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the advent of Blockchain, the cornerstone of a new credit system in the
    world comes along, and that is the algorithm. The word “algorithm” comes from
    a computer concept. One of the algorithm’s features is consistency, the basic
    definition of which is that regardless of time and place, as long as the input
    is definite, through the algorithm, the output must also be definite. Blockchain
    is a new type of credit system based on this feature of the algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Second, why do we choose Blockchain? Because it has a number of major features:
    First, it is safe. From a technical point of view, Blockchain is essentially a
    distributed database with each data node storing a copy of all the data in this
    distributed system. That is, each data node independently records every transaction
    in the Blockchain world. When a transaction occurs, the system broadcasts the
    transaction to each data node in the Blockchain through the P2P protocol. For
    example, if there are 100 people in the Blockchain, and one of them transfers
    money to another person, and the remitter worries that the recipient might lie
    that no remittance has been received, the remitter then sends an e-mail with the
    remittance bill and his or her own autograph to the rest of the people. Since
    ninety-eight people can prove the authenticity of the remittance, the recipient
    will not be able to falsify.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Second, it is stable. I once heard someone say this before: even the U.S. president,
    no matter how powerful he is, cannot destroy Blockchain. As the most mature application
    of Blockchain, the Bitcoin Blockchain has tens of thousands of data nodes throughout
    the world. The Bitcoin protocol organizes these nodes into a powerful Blockchain
    network, so it is very difficult for someone or a particular organization to destroy
    a Blockchain.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, what do we do with Blockchain? The Bitcoin Blockchain now can make
    peer-to-peer payments. For example, if you want to wire some money to a friend
    in the United States, traditionally you need to go to the bank, and the money
    will be transferred to the United States through the international remittance
    channel SWIFT, and then it is delivered to your friend through a local U.S. bank.
    Such a traditional remittance method has drawbacks including high remittance fees,
    long remittance cycle, and an opaque remittance process. However, Blockchain can
    truly achieve point-to-point remittance with a short remittance cycle, and open
    and transparent information, which people can access at any time.

    In response to the drawbacks of traditional remittance methods, OKLink has designed
    a global remittance network that features direct payment, low remittance fees,
    and open information that can be tracked throughout the process at any time. Its
    remittance services are now available in Canada, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines,
    India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan (China), Hong Kong (China), and other
    countries and regions, and they can basically achieve direct payments. It’s amazing,
    isn’t it?

    designers who always love exploring new things. I have always wondered whether
    visual images incorporating relevant design elements are more intuitive and interesting
    than boring data and general explanations. For us who are in constant contact
    with traditional data, this is undoubtedly a new attempt and challenge, and the
    complexity of the Blockchain technology itself also makes the design work more
    difficult.

- en: 'A simple design does not indicate a simple design process. It is not easy for
    designers to visualize Blockchain in a simple and concise manner. In the early
    stage of design, we put design before data and, by sticking to our original aspiration,
    developed solutions based on presentation modes. Using relevant packages of Python
    (an object-oriented interpreted computer programming language), we understood
    the principles of Blockchain and the concept that transaction history cannot be
    rewritten. The technology that puts aside banks and uses a verifiable distributed
    ledger system to verify transactions is simply remarkable. After analyzing and
    understanding the principles of Blockchain, we decided to use the JavaScript (an
    interpreted script language) D3.js library, as D3 has a rich variety of icon types
    and supports SVG format. The data charts built with it are very powerful, and
    we can use its rich features to fully express the complexity of Blockchain with
    excellent visual performance. In the later stages, we combined design with data,
    as visual development should start with simple data. For example, 834 transactions
    are recorded in block #235235, and such a large number of transactions indicates
    difficulty in visual performance. So, to ensure that the overall visual design
    remain unaffected by data changes, we should emphasize data. The purpose of a
    designer is to make a process clear and concise through simple and straightforward
    visual design. For example, through a visual system, both the remitter and the
    recipient can track the flow of transactions during the transaction process.'

    we hope that when people see the charts, they can quickly realize that “Wow, so
    Blockchain is not so difficult a concept to understand.” Blockchain is indeed
    not a new technology, and it only becomes difficult to understand after technical
    personnel have associated a lot of professional terms with it.

    we asked our chief researcher at Blockchain to do live broadcasts to explain Blockchain.
    However, after promoting the broadcasts through a variety of online channels,
    the average number of viewers per broadcast was only several hundred. We wondered
    why other people’s live broadcasts had millions of viewers, yet we only had a
    few hundred, and no one cared enough to send us virtual gifts. Then, one of my
    colleagues explained, “You see, the hosts of other live broadcasts are all beautiful,
    and their voices are all very sweet, of course they attract a lot of viewers!”
    It made sense. So we invited the most beautiful colleagues in our company to explain
    Blockchain live. At the same time, we increased our efforts to promote our live
    broadcasts through online channels and encouraged people to share the information
    on their social network platforms. Though in the end the viewers reached only
    several thousand, we were glad to see that we received more virtual gifts and
    attention from more young people. However, they still did not understand Blockchain,
