    win the market, then the market captures users, and ultimately income and profits
    are generated. However, compared to other Internet companies, Blockchain startups
    have more urgent demands and higher requirements for outstanding talents. The
    people who are needed to explore the rapidly evolving Blockchain technology are
    those who are perseverant and bold, but also cautious and unafraid to take risks.
    A good Blockchain company is itself a network of value nodes, and various kinds
    of professionals who have expertise in product development, testing, marketing,
    and business operations are all indispensable. The primary task for the COO is
    to continuously spot talented people and form an excellent team to ensure the
    company’s healthy development.

- en: The first time that I heard the word Blockchain was probably in early 2013\.
    As a person engaged in the research and development of Internet technology, I
    read all the Chinese and English materials available at the time with immense
    curiosity. Although limited by my English level, I still wanted to understand
    the principles of Blockchain technology in an authentic way. Today, everyone regards
    Blockchain as a kind of technology, and at that time I also believed that it must
    possess some characteristics of technology. So from this perspective, I further
    studied this so-called “technology.” Below, I will talk about my understanding
    of Blockchain following the three steps of learning, namely, what, why, and how.
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我第一次听到区块链这个词可能是在2013年初。作为一名从事互联网技术研发的人员，我怀着极大的好奇心阅读了当时能找到的所有中文和英文材料。尽管受限于我的英语水平，我还是想以一种真正的方式理解区块链技术的原理。如今，每个人都把区块链视为一种技术，当时我也认为它一定具备某些技术的特征。所以从这一点来看，我进一步研究了这种所谓的“技术”。以下，我将根据学习的三个步骤，即是什么、为什么和如何，来谈谈我对区块链的理解。
- en: First of all, what is Blockchain? Currently, all mainstream media are talking
    about Blockchain, defining it as a technology. I don’t quite agree with this definition;
    instead, I believe that Blockchain, a new thing, is more like a set of solutions
    for credit problems. It is common knowledge that currently there are only several
    credit systems in the world. First is the system based on morality, which is to
    solve credit problems by way of moral constraints. For example, when we have meals
    in restaurants, because of information asymmetry, we do not know whether the restaurants
    use gutter oil or unhealthy ingredients, but we choose to trust the restaurants’
    owners and believe that they will not do anything harmful to the physical and
    mental health of their customers. The second system is based on beliefs. I once
    heard a joke that problems concerning food safety rarely occur in the West, and
    one of the important reasons is that people engaged in food production are afraid
    of God’s punishment. Since everyone believes in God and that God is a fair judge,
    a credit system has been established based on such a belief. The third system
    is based on government. When it comes to government, we have to talk about the
    banking system of every country in the world. It can be said that they are all
    based on government. Every citizen believes that his or her government will not
    collapse and that at any time, a government is a strong backing for its people.
    As long as the government remains intact, the figures in people’s bank accounts
    have value and can act as a medium for commodity exchange.

  zh: 首先，区块链是什么？目前，所有主流媒体都在谈论区块链，将其定义为一种技术。我并不完全同意这个定义；相反，我认为区块链，作为一种新事物，更像是一套解决信用问题的解决方案。众所周知，目前世界上只有几种信用体系。首先是基于道德的系统，通过道德约束来解决信用问题。例如，当我们在餐厅吃饭时，由于信息不对称，我们不知道餐厅是否使用地沟油或不良成分，但我们选择相信餐厅的老板，相信他们不会对顾客的身心健康造成任何伤害。第二个系统是基于信仰的。我曾经听到一个笑话，说食品安全问题在西方很少发生，其中一个重要原因是从事食品生产的人害怕上帝的惩罚。因为大家都相信上帝，而且上帝是一个公正的法官，所以建立了一个基于这种信仰的信用体系。第三个系统是基于政府的。说到政府，我们就得谈谈世界上每个国家的银行系统。可以说，它们都基于政府。每个公民都相信他的政府不会崩溃，而且随时都是一个强大的后盾。只要政府保持完整，人们账户里的数字就有价值，可以作为商品交换的媒介。
- en: After the advent of Blockchain, the cornerstone of a new credit system in the
    world comes along, and that is the algorithm. The word “algorithm” comes from
    a computer concept. One of the algorithm’s features is consistency, the basic
    definition of which is that regardless of time and place, as long as the input
    is definite, through the algorithm, the output must also be definite. Blockchain
    is a new type of credit system based on this feature of the algorithm.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 区块链出现后，世界上新信用体系的基础随之而来，那就是算法。算法这个词来源于计算机概念。算法的一个特性是一致性，其基本定义是，无论时间和地点，只要输入是确定的，通过算法，输出也必须是确定的。区块链是一种基于算法这一特性的新型信用系统。
- en: 'Second, why do we choose Blockchain? Because it has a number of major features:
    First, it is safe. From a technical point of view, Blockchain is essentially a
    distributed database with each data node storing a copy of all the data in this
    distributed system. That is, each data node independently records every transaction
    in the Blockchain world. When a transaction occurs, the system broadcasts the
    transaction to each data node in the Blockchain through the P2P protocol. For
    example, if there are 100 people in the Blockchain, and one of them transfers
    money to another person, and the remitter worries that the recipient might lie
    that no remittance has been received, the remitter then sends an e-mail with the
    remittance bill and his or her own autograph to the rest of the people. Since
    ninety-eight people can prove the authenticity of the remittance, the recipient
    will not be able to falsify.'
  id: totrans-27

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 其次，我们为什么选择区块链？因为它有许多主要特性：首先，它是安全的。从技术角度来看，区块链本质上是一个分布式数据库，每个数据节点存储着这个分布式系统中的所有数据的一份。也就是说，每个数据节点独立记录区块链世界中的每一笔交易。当发生一笔交易时，系统通过P2P协议将交易广播到区块链中的每个数据节点。例如，如果区块链中有100个人，其中一个人向另一个人转账，而且发款人担心收款人可能会说没有收到转账，那么发款人就会发送一封带有转账单和他的签名的电子邮件给其他人。因为98个人可以证明转账的真实性，所以收款人无法伪造。
- en: 'Second, it is stable. I once heard someone say this before: even the U.S. president,
    no matter how powerful he is, cannot destroy Blockchain. As the most mature application
    of Blockchain, the Bitcoin Blockchain has tens of thousands of data nodes throughout
    the world. The Bitcoin protocol organizes these nodes into a powerful Blockchain
    network, so it is very difficult for someone or a particular organization to destroy
    a Blockchain.'
  id: totrans-28

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 其次，它是稳定的。我曾经听人说过这样的话：即使是美国总统，无论他多么强大，都无法摧毁区块链。作为区块链最成熟的应用，比特币区块链在全球范围内拥有成千上万的数据节点。比特币协议将这些节点组织成一个强大的区块链网络，因此要摧毁一个区块链对某个人或特定组织来说是非常困难的。
- en: Finally, what do we do with Blockchain? The Bitcoin Blockchain now can make
    peer-to-peer payments. For example, if you want to wire some money to a friend
    in the United States, traditionally you need to go to the bank, and the money
    will be transferred to the United States through the international remittance
    channel SWIFT, and then it is delivered to your friend through a local U.S. bank.
    Such a traditional remittance method has drawbacks including high remittance fees,
    long remittance cycle, and an opaque remittance process. However, Blockchain can
    truly achieve point-to-point remittance with a short remittance cycle, and open
    and transparent information, which people can access at any time.

  zh: 最后，我们用区块链做什么呢？比特币区块链现在可以进行点对点支付。例如，如果你想向美国的一个朋友汇款一些钱，传统上你需要去银行，然后通过国际汇款渠道 SWIFT
    将资金转移到美国，然后通过美国当地的银行将资金转交给你的朋友。这样的传统汇款方法存在高昂的汇款费用、长时间的汇款周期和不透明的汇款流程等缺点。然而，区块链可以真正实现点对点汇款，汇款周期短，信息公开透明，人们可以随时访问。
- en: Currently, OKLink is working to build a Blockchain-based global remittance network.
    In response to the drawbacks of traditional remittance methods, OKLink has designed
    a global remittance network that features direct payment, low remittance fees,
    and open information that can be tracked throughout the process at any time. Its
    remittance services are now available in Canada, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines,
    India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan (China), Hong Kong (China), and other
    countries and regions, and they can basically achieve direct payments. It’s amazing,
    isn’t it?

- en: 'A simple design does not indicate a simple design process. It is not easy for
    designers to visualize Blockchain in a simple and concise manner. In the early
    stage of design, we put design before data and, by sticking to our original aspiration,
    developed solutions based on presentation modes. Using relevant packages of Python
    (an object-oriented interpreted computer programming language), we understood
    the principles of Blockchain and the concept that transaction history cannot be
    rewritten. The technology that puts aside banks and uses a verifiable distributed
    ledger system to verify transactions is simply remarkable. After analyzing and
    understanding the principles of Blockchain, we decided to use the JavaScript (an
    interpreted script language) D3.js library, as D3 has a rich variety of icon types
    and supports SVG format. The data charts built with it are very powerful, and
    we can use its rich features to fully express the complexity of Blockchain with
    excellent visual performance. In the later stages, we combined design with data,
    as visual development should start with simple data. For example, 834 transactions
    are recorded in block #235235, and such a large number of transactions indicates
    difficulty in visual performance. So, to ensure that the overall visual design
    remain unaffected by data changes, we should emphasize data. The purpose of a
    designer is to make a process clear and concise through simple and straightforward
    visual design. For example, through a visual system, both the remitter and the
    recipient can track the flow of transactions during the transaction process.'
  id: totrans-37

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 简洁的设计并不意味着设计过程简单。设计师要想简洁明了地展示区块链并不容易。在设计初期，我们把设计放在数据之前，坚持初心，基于展示模式开发解决方案。使用Python（一种面向对象的解释型计算机编程语言）的相关包，我们理解了区块链的原理和交易历史不可篡改的概念。采用除银行外的可验证分布式账本系统来验证交易的技术令人惊叹。在分析和理解了区块链的原理后，我们决定使用JavaScript（一种解释型脚本语言）的D3.js库，因为D3拥有丰富的图标类型并支持SVG格式。用它构建的数据图表非常强大，我们可以利用其丰富的特性充分表达区块链的复杂性，具有优秀的视觉表现。在后期，我们把设计和数据结合起来，因为视觉开发应该从简单数据开始。例如，在区块#235235中记录了834笔交易，这样大量的交易表明视觉表现有难度。所以，为了确保整体视觉设计不受数据变化的影响，我们应该强调数据。设计师的目的是通过简洁明了的视觉设计使过程清晰简洁。例如，通过一个视觉系统，发款人和收款人都可以在交易过程中跟踪交易流程。
- en: Visual presentation reduces the difficulty of understanding Blockchain, and
    we hope that when people see the charts, they can quickly realize that “Wow, so
    Blockchain is not so difficult a concept to understand.” Blockchain is indeed
    not a new technology, and it only becomes difficult to understand after technical
    personnel have associated a lot of professional terms with it.

  zh: 在许多活动之后，我们发现大多数参与者是三十到四十岁之间的男性，大多数是程序员或在金融机构工作。这个人群的一个独特特点是他们很少在社交网站上活跃，在了解了区块链之后，他们倾向于在向他人解释时使用许多技术术语。使用陌生的术语使得区块链的推广进展缓慢，一次活动只能影响大约一千人，而且人力、物力和财力成本非常高，更不用说有些参与者只是为了礼物而来。
- en: 'In mid-2016, there were many opportunities in the live broadcast industry with
    a massive influx of traffic. This caught our attention: promoting Blockchain through
    live broadcasts must be very effective, and it could encourage many young people
    to understand Blockchain! We immediately started arranging activities. At first,
    we asked our chief researcher at Blockchain to do live broadcasts to explain Blockchain.
    However, after promoting the broadcasts through a variety of online channels,
    the average number of viewers per broadcast was only several hundred. We wondered
    why other people’s live broadcasts had millions of viewers, yet we only had a
    few hundred, and no one cared enough to send us virtual gifts. Then, one of my
    colleagues explained, “You see, the hosts of other live broadcasts are all beautiful,
    and their voices are all very sweet, of course they attract a lot of viewers!”
    It made sense. So we invited the most beautiful colleagues in our company to explain
    Blockchain live. At the same time, we increased our efforts to promote our live
    broadcasts through online channels and encouraged people to share the information
    on their social network platforms. Though in the end the viewers reached only
    several thousand, we were glad to see that we received more virtual gifts and
    attention from more young people. However, they still did not understand Blockchain,
    and all they cared about was whether our pretty colleagues had had meals yet or
    whether they were seeing someone. Promoting the concept of Blockchain still seems
    like a very challenging task.'

  zh: 2016年中，随着大量流量的涌入，直播行业有很多机会。这引起了我们的注意：通过直播推广区块链肯定非常有效，它可能会鼓励许多年轻人去了解区块链！我们立刻开始安排相关活动。起初，我们请区块链的首席研究员做直播解释区块链。然而，在通过各种在线渠道推广直播后，每场直播的平均观众人数只有几百。我们想知道为什么别人的直播有上百万观众，而我们只有几百，也没有人愿意给我们送虚拟礼物。然后，我的一个同事解释说：“你看，其他直播的主播都很漂亮，声音也很甜，当然能吸引很多观众！”这个解释很有道理。所以我们邀请公司最漂亮的同事来解释区块链。同时，我们加大了通过在线渠道推广直播的力度，并鼓励人们在社交网络平台上分享信息。尽管最后观众人数也只有几千人，我们还是很高兴看到我们收到了更多的虚拟礼物和更多年轻人的关注。然而，他们仍然没有理解区块链，他们关心的只是我们漂亮的同事有没有吃饭，或者她们在看着谁。推广区块链的概念似乎仍然是一个非常具有挑战性的任务。
- en: Perseverance is the key, and we are still vigorously trying to promote Blockchain
    through various channels, such as we media, video, audio, books, etc. We hope
    that Blockchain, the potential underlying technology for financial infrastructure,
    can be understood by the public and facilitate people’s lives just like the Internet.

  zh: 持之以恒是关键，我们仍在通过各种渠道，如自媒体、视频、音频、书籍等大力推广区块链。我们希望区块链这一金融基础设施的潜在底层技术能够被公众理解，并像互联网一样方便人们的生活。
- en: At present, most of the people who understand Blockchain are employees of large
    financial institutions or geek masters, which explains why there is a large number
    of technical terms in Blockchain introduction materials. At the same time, Blockchain
    itself is also obscure and difficult to understand, so it takes months for a person
    with no technical background to understand the concept of Blockchain, its history,
    basic technologies, operating principles, and upper applications.

  zh: 目前，了解区块链的人大部分是大金融机构的员工或者是技术高手，这也解释了为什么区块链介绍材料中会有大量的技术术语。同时，区块链本身也相当复杂和难以理解，所以一个没有技术背景的人要理解区块链的概念、历史、基本技术、运行原理以及上层应用，需要花费数月时间。
- en: The purpose of this book is thus to compress the months to a week or even several
    days.
