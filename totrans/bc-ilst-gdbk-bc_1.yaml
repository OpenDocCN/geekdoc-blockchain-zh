  zh: 我们理解和塑造世界的方式一直在变化，技术是这一变化的主要推动力。
- en: Over the past few years, Blockchain has drawn considerable attention with its
    mystery of invention, the staggering price of Bitcoin, and the top-level design
    of financial reforms. Now, many people sing highly of its potential, comparing
    it to that of the Internet.

  zh: 在过去的几年里，随着区块链发明之谜的神秘性、比特币惊人价格以及金融改革顶层设计的吸引，区块链吸引了大量的注意力。现在，许多人高度赞扬它的潜力，将其与互联网相提并论。
- en: One difficulty facing all technologies in the process of popularization is how
    to educate the public about the new technology. The same is true for Blockchain.
    At an early stage, the people in China’s Blockchain community quibbled over the
    Chinese translation of “Blockchain.” Why? Because translation of the term is the
    very first step in getting this technology across to people’s minds. As the Internet
    is translated as “Hulianwang,” literally meaning a web that connects one another,
    it is necessary to give Blockchain an abstract name in Chinese to allow laypersons
    to understand what it means. “Qukuai” means “block” in Chinese, and “lian” means
    “chain”; even though it can be a little bit confusing for those who have no idea
    of this new technology, this Chinese term for Blockchain has been chosen and accepted
    by the public, for until now, no better translation can be proposed. After the
    translation of the term was decided, books concerning Blockchain begin to spring
    up like mushrooms. Different from those professional books full of abstruse illustrations
    and incomprehensible explanation, this book will focus on giving ordinary readers
    a glimpse of what Blockchain is, how it works, and what it can do.

  zh: 所有技术在普及过程中面临的一个困难是如何向公众普及这项新技术。这对区块链来说同样适用。在早期阶段，中国区块链社区的成员们对“Blockchain”的中文翻译进行了争论。为什么？因为术语的翻译是让这项技术深入人心
    的第一步。互联网被翻译为“互联网”，字面上意味着一个相互连接的网，因此有必要给区块链一个抽象的中文名字，让非专业人士能够理解其含义。“区块”在中文中的意思是“block”，“链”在中文中的意思是“chain”；尽管对于那些对这项新技术一无所知的人来说可能会有些混淆，但这个中文术语“区块链”已经被公众选择和接受，因为到目前为止，还没有提出更好的翻译。术语的翻译确定后，关于区块链的书籍如雨后春笋般出现。与那些充满深奥图表和专业解释的专业书籍不同，这本书将重点向普通读者展示区块链是什么，它是如何工作的，以及它能做什么。
- en: The good intentions of the authors are also embodied in this book, as evidenced
    by vivid pictures and plain language that make this technology easily understandable.
    When reading this book, readers will not only be able to learn a fashionable concept,
    but they can also obtain enough knowledge to impress their friends when discussing
    WeChat Moments.

  zh: 作者的良好意图也体现在这本书中，这从生动的图片和平实的语言中可见一斑，这些特点使得这项技术容易理解。阅读这本书时，读者不仅能够学到一个时尚的概念，还能获得足够的知识，在讨论微信朋友圈时让朋友们印象深刻。
- en: Of course, the journey to popularize Blockchain technology is far from smooth.
    It still requires readers to learn more about its fundamental technical concepts.
    So I would like to suggest that you visit the Chinese Museum of Finance to see
    the Bitcoin mining machines and see why it is difficult to crack Hash code and
    learn the latest development trends in the Blockchain industry in order to keep
    abreast of the times. You may think that there is no need for you to master this
    complicated technology during your lifetime. However, even at first glance, this
    book will help you to embrace a new world and understand it can be a new way of
    recording history, registering rights, and understanding value transfer.

  zh: 当然，普及区块链技术的道路还远非一帆风顺。它仍然需要读者了解更多其基本技术概念。所以我建议你们去中国金融博物馆看看比特币采矿机，了解为什么破解哈希代码困难，并了解区块链行业的最新发展趋势，以跟上时代的步伐。你们可能认为，在你们的一生中没有必要掌握这项复杂的技术。然而，即使在一瞥之间，这本书也将帮助你们拥抱一个新世界，并理解它可能是一种新的记录历史、注册权利和理解价值转移的方式。
- en: As one of the forerunners of the Bitcoin industry, Star Xu, with his technological
    accumulation of facts and acute insight, founded OKCoin, the most popular Bitcoin
    Exchange in China. To promote a wider application of Blockchain technology, he
    wrote and presented for us this book. I believe his effort will add more momentum
    to the dissemination of the technology of Blockchain.
