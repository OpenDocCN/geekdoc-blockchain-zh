    mystery of invention, the staggering price of Bitcoin, and the top-level design
    of financial reforms. Now, many people sing highly of its potential, comparing
    it to that of the Internet.

    to educate the public about the new technology. The same is true for Blockchain.
    At an early stage, the people in China’s Blockchain community quibbled over the
    Chinese translation of “Blockchain.” Why? Because translation of the term is the
    very first step in getting this technology across to people’s minds. As the Internet
    is translated as “Hulianwang,” literally meaning a web that connects one another,
    it is necessary to give Blockchain an abstract name in Chinese to allow laypersons
    to understand what it means. “Qukuai” means “block” in Chinese, and “lian” means
    “chain”; even though it can be a little bit confusing for those who have no idea
    of this new technology, this Chinese term for Blockchain has been chosen and accepted
    by the public, for until now, no better translation can be proposed. After the
    translation of the term was decided, books concerning Blockchain begin to spring
    up like mushrooms. Different from those professional books full of abstruse illustrations
    and incomprehensible explanation, this book will focus on giving ordinary readers
    a glimpse of what Blockchain is, how it works, and what it can do.

    by vivid pictures and plain language that make this technology easily understandable.
    When reading this book, readers will not only be able to learn a fashionable concept,
    but they can also obtain enough knowledge to impress their friends when discussing
    WeChat Moments.

- en: Of course, the journey to popularize Blockchain technology is far from smooth.
    It still requires readers to learn more about its fundamental technical concepts.
    So I would like to suggest that you visit the Chinese Museum of Finance to see
    the Bitcoin mining machines and see why it is difficult to crack Hash code and
    learn the latest development trends in the Blockchain industry in order to keep
    abreast of the times. You may think that there is no need for you to master this
    complicated technology during your lifetime. However, even at first glance, this
    book will help you to embrace a new world and understand it can be a new way of
    recording history, registering rights, and understanding value transfer.

    accumulation of facts and acute insight, founded OKCoin, the most popular Bitcoin
    Exchange in China. To promote a wider application of Blockchain technology, he
    wrote and presented for us this book. I believe his effort will add more momentum
    to the dissemination of the technology of Blockchain.
