    type of currency with the exception that they use encryption and decryption techniques
    to document every transaction. The cryptography not only keeps the details of
    the transaction secure but also protects the identity of the parties involved
    as well.

- en: As more and more places of business are in a position to accept a digital currency
    as payment for their product or services, cryptocurrencies will gradually begin
    to overtake physical money. But unless you’re dealing with them on a regular basis,
    you’re probably not aware of how many different cryptocurrencies are already floating
    around the market.

    a void in the economy. Unlike traditional dollars and coins, a cryptocurrency
    can be designed to achieve a certain purpose. Of course, not all cryptocurrencies
    are the same. Because they are so easy to create, some have been developed as
    a joke, others for scams, and still others for special events or occasions.

    see why they are so important.

- en: Most likely when you think of digital currency, Bitcoin is the name that comes
    to your mind. Just like the name Xerox is almost synonymous with copy, Bitcoin
    is often confused and believed to be the only cryptocurrency around. Some people
    actually refer to it as the "people's currency" because they expect it to be the
    one cryptocurrency that will uproot and replace all national currencies in the
    future.

    was the very first digital currency of its kind. It holds the largest market cap
    to date, placing it well over any other currency on the list.

    is with Bitcoin. It is without a doubt the leader of the pack and has had the
    longest history of any other coins on the market. As a matter of fact, all other
    coins are referred to as altcoins (alternative coins) because they are viewed
    as alternatives to Bitcoin.

    It is even possible now to pick up Bitcoins through ATM being introduced in some

    differences. Where Bitcoin is geared more towards keeping track of who owns the
    currency, Ethereum is designed more towards the function of the programming code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ethereum is most known for its use of Smart Contracts, offering people the ability
    to code and enact very definite contract terms without the involvement of a third-party.
    At its basic level, it solves the problem of handling legal contracts online.
    When a smart contract is put into motion, it works like a self-operating computer
    program designed to take action automatically once agreed upon conditions are
    met. Whatever the system is programmed to do, it will follow those procedures
    exactly. There is no possibility to censor or interfere with the parameters set.
  prefs: []

    Ethereum's ability to process code. A developer is free to come up with thousands
    of different applications, so its potential is virtually endless.

    where users can transfer currency from one party to the next. It is designed to
    work pretty much the same way that Bitcoin does on a decentralized network using
    the same format that the Internet does with the information.
  prefs: []

    different parties. It eliminates the snags of different companies using different
    systems, so that transfer of funds is practically seamless regardless of the country
    it is going to.

    of digital currency, but it will also speed up the transfer process and provide
    more stability. With Ripple, there is no need to wait for confirmation, so every
    transaction goes through quickly.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the biggest problems people deal within online technology is that of
    maintaining privacy, which is Monero's primary concern. While this may present
    a problem in most western governments, Monero is extremely important in nations
    where one's identity must be protected at all costs. For example, in the USA when
    people are concerned about their identity, it is about protecting their assets.
    They don’t want someone to come in and steal the value they have accumulated.
    However, for someone who lives in places where playing on the economic playground
    could be perceived as anti-government, secrecy could mean your life.

- en: In addition to being private, it is secure, and anything traded through Monero
    is untraceable. It uses its own unique cryptography that ensures that every transaction
    made cannot be linked to the parties involved. This is accomplished through the
    use of multiple keys. Unlike other cryptocurrencies where the user may have one
    public view key and one private view key, with Monero your public key is provided
    to generate a one-time public address. The private key, however, is given to the
    receiver to scan the Blockchain to search for the funds they are to receive.

- en: One of the reasons Monero is so popular is because you can maintain total control
    over all of your transactions. Therefore, you and only you are responsible for
    what happens to your money. It is also fungible meaning, and no one can know the
    history of the money you received.

    significant functional differences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While both currencies have the same purpose, Litecoin processes much faster
    than Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin transactions are not complete until they have received
    confirmation, users must "wait" for "miners" to verify every transaction. This
    process could take as little as 10 minutes, but it could also take much longer.
    Litecoin does the same thing in an even shorter time frame.

    a product. If you want to make money using cryptocurrency, it also has to be appealing
    to the masses. Remember, the value of any currency is not backed up by any government
    or organization but is determined by the basics of supply and demand. For that
    to happen, it must solve a particular problem.

    Take the time to learn about the technology behind it, learn about its developers

    goal.
