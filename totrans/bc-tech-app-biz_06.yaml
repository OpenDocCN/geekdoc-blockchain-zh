- en: In the era of tech-driven globalization, supply chains are becoming increasingly
    complex, with an increasing number of stakeholders spread across continents. A
    complex supply chain requires complex management systems. Supply chain management
    digitalization and information technology have advanced simultaneously in time,
    but a more technological and connected society calls for more information, uncovering
    the limits of supply chain management tools available today, which, while providing
    efficiency, automation, and organizational capabilities, are quite scarce in providing
    transparency. Consumer awareness on sensible issues such as climate change, human
    rights, or counterfeiting is increasing.

- en: In the era of tech-driven globalization, supply chains are becoming increasingly
    complex, with an increasing number of stakeholders spread across continents (Abeyratne
    et al., 2016). A worldwide supply chain requires complex management systems, which
    call for more information to guarantee transparency (Abeyratne et al., 2016).
    Consumers’ awareness of sensible issues such as climate change, human rights,
    and counterfeiting is increasing. Despite the transparency expected by end-users,
    companies themselves have very limited visibility on supply chains (Deloitte,
    2018). Modern Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tools are falling short of current
    supply chain management requirements and are based on both the quality and the
    quantity of available information (Li et al., 2006). Information on inputs and
    processes is very unreliable due to the centralization of data storage, which
    can be easily accessed and perturbed, leaving space for fraud and falsification;
    all these issues contribute to lower quality outputs and generally lower customer
    satisfaction (De Giovanni, 2020a; Eskildsen et al., 2007).

- en: One important solution emerging nowadays for solving these issues is blockchain.
    The blockchain is a ledger technology that is distributed, decentralized, and
    public. Because the information blocks are concatenated in a chronological manner,
    any attempt to change the data stored would require the recalculation of all precedent
    blocks (Gurtu et al., 2019). Furthermore, with the way the data are distributed,
    any tampering attempt must be carried out on all network’s machines making the
    data stored on the blockchain practically immutable (De Giovanni, 2020b). This
    technology is not new since it has been available since 1991\. Nevertheless, the
    focus has primarily hovered around cryptocurrencies and financial transactions
    (Gurtu et al., 2019). Only relatively recent literature and practical examples
    have started to implement the tamper-proof distributed ledger concept to the supply
    chain as a means of replacing non-transparent centralized supply chain management
    (SCM) tools. The benefits of the technology are relevant, and governments worldwide
    have started drafting policies to determine an implementation agenda (Suominen
    et al., 2018). While the blockchain could be a significant step forward for large
    supply chains to improve current ERP solutions, it may represent a breakthrough
    for smaller enterprises, lagging behind on digitalization (Buratto et al., 2019)
    and often taking the hit from non-transparent supply chains (Zimmerman, 2016).

    economy, contributing circa 66% to the value added by non-financial businesses
    (World Bank, 2019). The largest number of SMEs is active in the food sector, which
    is also the main industry by gross domestic product (GDP) contribution. Despite
    the large quantity of academic studies and pioneering examples in the application
    of the blockchain to large-scale supply chains or in the banking industry, studies
    on the implementation of the technology on small enterprises remains very theoretical.
    Therefore, this chapter aims to contribute in a practical manner to the discussion
    on the implementation of the blockchain as an SCM tool for SMEs by answering the

    each activity would be affected by the blockchain. Our findings reveal that the
    blockchain can contribute significantly to supply chain management by improving
    supplier selection processes; increasing harvests, thanks to Internet of Things
    (IoT) sensors, enabling access to larger retailers; and, ultimately, providing
    transparency to final consumers. Despite the benefits, the costs analysis highlights
    that the direct economic advantages obtainable in terms of increased production
    and higher prices would not explain the investment. Research suggests that an
    implementation framework similar to the one used by large corporations where the
    network is built by focus firm and proposed to suppliers is not applicable to
    SMEs. Due to the lack of internal resources, Italian and European SMEs like the
    one examined cannot afford the implementation of such technology. The early stage
    of maturity of blockchain translates into scarce standardization, and the existing
    out-of-the-box solutions cannot yet fully harvest the benefits of a blockchain-enabled
    supply chain. The idea brought forward by the Australian government is the development
    of a unique blockchain infrastructure to which national businesses can connect,
    exchange goods, and complete transactions while enabling information sharing across
    companies. Governments, start-ups and larger tech corporations are moving in this
    direction. However, this line of thought still requires deep research. Future
    studies aimed at favouring digitalization and transparency for smaller businesses
    through the use of blockchain shall explore the organizational viability of a
    central blockchain network as well as creating a solution able to satisfy the
    numerous different business models of all the SMEs active within a country.

- en: SCM is a very extensive concept. Digitalization can take different forms across
    the many layers of the supply chain, and each technology serves a specific purpose
    in improving the efficiency of the supply chain (De Giovanni, 2021a). From 3D
    printing to radio-frequency identification (RFID) and cloud computing, the technologies
    adopted in modern supply chain management are numerous (Agrawal et al., 2018).
    For the purpose of this chapter, we focus on SCM systems and software, which gather
    and manage data obtained from all different devices and technologies across the
    supply chain to gather, elaborate, and share information across partner firms,
    as are compatible with the utility that the blockchain technology can bring to
    SCM. Such systems are called ERP software and are management software that, through
    a suite of applications, track resources, transaction, and contracts (www.sap.com).
    Such solutions already enable the digitalization of most of SCM processes, from
    demand forecasting, inventory tracking and management, to order placement and
    fulfilment, as well as enabling to a certain extent contracts management (De Giovanni,
    2016). Systems such as SAP manage well the organizational aspect of the SCM in
    order to maximize supply chain efficiency. However, issues of transparency and
    traceability still remain. According to a survey completed by Deloitte, 65% of
    procurement managers surveyed state they have no visibility beyond tier-1 suppliers
    (Deloitte, 2018). In systems such as SAP, firms receiving product information
    must either trust their partners on the contracts signed or carry out a secondary
    analysis, leading often to loss in efficiency due to double checks or disputes
    over characteristics of products and services received.

    Many studies and experiments have been carried out on this technology, and today
    it is starting to be integrated both in pre-existing ERP software from companies
    such as IBM (www.ibm.com), as well as completely new solutions being developed.
    SCM is a broad topic, and it deals with the management of many different areas
    of the supply chain. Blockchain must be integrated at every level to satisfy the
    organizational requirement of each department (Van Hoek, 2019). At the same time,
    the blockchain system must be integrated along the entire supply chain so that
    customers and peers at the end of the chain have access to information on suppliers,
    logistics, and so forth, and the other way around. As of today, research on the
    implementation of blockchain within the supply chain is still at an early stage,
    and, despite the hype around the technology, the studies are still mostly theoretical
    (Dobrovnik et al., 2018). While the publications available describe it as a breakthrough,
    such theories are still based on little implementation and might create unreliable
    expectations.

    of their ERP software to provide for additional security and validity (Oracle.com).
    Large companies with strong supplier bargaining power tend to implement the system
    for their own processes and then require suppliers to participate to the network
    (Hyperledger.org). According to a scenario developed by Deloitte, a turnkey blockchain-enabled
    supply chain today has an estimated annual cost of over 200,000 dollars, highlighting
    how expensive the technology is at the current stage (Deloitte, 2019).

    each peer can access, view, and add any information Lin et al. (2018). This decentralized
    platform should be accessible at every stage of the supply chain and by the firms
    involved at each level to maximize the integration (Duhaylongsod & De Giovanni,
    2019). Any stakeholder should be able to access any kind of information regarding
    the products or transactions. Despite that this model of a transparent and integrated
    supply chain may represent an advantage in terms of efficiency and quality, managers
    appear sceptical of sharing strategic information with partners (De Giovanni,
    2021b).

    (Wang et al., 2019). Today, many firms have a selection of suppliers that they
    trust more and are more integrated with. Companies such as Luxottica carry out
    a continuous supplier evaluation in order to maximize trust in supply chain partners
    (Luxottica, 2020). Such monitoring of parties might be even easier thanks to the
    information disclosure of a blockchain system, which would deeply affect the relationships
    between supply chain partners, and it might require establishing a new governance
    model to manage the supply chain (Wang et al., 2019).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key element defining a relationship between any two parties in a supply
    chain is the contract (De Giovanni, 2019a). Contracts establish trust between
    counterparts. Any transaction and exchange of resources must be carried out according
    to pre-agreed and pre-defined terms. In blockchain-enabled SCM, such contracts
    would be converted into smart contracts. Smart contracts are no more than a digitalized
    “scripted version” of real-life contracts (Christidis et al., 2016). Just like
    in the real world, they determine the relationship between two parties. However,
    smart contracts also act as middlemen; they control the outcome of any transaction,
    whether monetary or of any exchange of goods and services, according to the pre-defined
    contractual terms. The clauses of any supply contract can be converted into “if
    statements,” meaning that if the conditions of the transaction between the two
    parties are infringed, the smart contracts will not approve the normal output
    of the transaction, impeding it (Christidis et al., 2016). A smart contract is
    able to avoid any dispute or damages before they happen and be based on both operational
    and economic terms (Preeker & De Giovanni, 2018). Unless all defined conditions
    are fulfilled, the transaction between the two parties in the blockchain cannot
    be executed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The outcome of a smart contract is always predictable, because if any parameter
    is not respected the contract rejects the exchange; in contrast, it accepts and
    confirms the transaction (Christidis et al., 2016). A smart contract is signed
    at the moment of execution; that is, if the terms are not met the contract does
    not take place (De Giovanni, 2019b).

- en: The benefits of the blockchain (and the smart contracts) are only enabled by
    the use of sensor and devices that can monitor and write to the ledger any information
    regarding the state of either a process or a product along the supply chain (Christidis
    et al., 2016). When dealing with IoT devices and blockchain, a keyword is RFID
    chips. RFID are thin magnetic tags, similar to the ones present in credit cards,
    which can store information. Extensive research has been carried out on the implementation
    of RFID technology to improve supply chain traceability. RFID chips can store
    more information than simple barcodes. They can be read-only or read-write, meaning
    that information can be added to an RFID tag as the products advance through manufacturing
    processes (Angeles, 2005). Moreover, the magnetic nature of the chip allows the
    tag to be identified at a greater distance, without the need for an optical reader
    and manual scanning. RFID tags are already widely used in the automotive industry.
    Both Ford and Chevrolet use RFID to track engine components throughout manufacturing
    processes (Swedberg, 2015). They can monitor the arrival of raw materials or finished
    goods at the manufacturing facility or retail store through RFID gates (readers;
    this allows for automatic inventory management as well as for keeping track of
    timing, especially for deteriorating goods such as foods. RFID can also confirm
    an order and communicate its completion to a smart contract. It is possible to
    know instantaneously the purchase of products and the leftover stock in the warehouse
    and place replenishment orders to suppliers, automatically enabling a leaner supply
    chain (Angeles, 2005; De Giovanni and Cariola, 2020).

- en: Beyond RFIDs, other devices such as sensors are fundamental to assure the terms
    and conditions specified in supply smart contracts. Having sensors measuring characteristics
    such as temperature, moisture, weight, or, for example, the presence of certain
    chemicals, is fundamental, especially in the agricultural industry, to assure
    the maximum level of quality and safety to the final consumers (Kamilaris et al.,
    2020; Zeto, 2018). For example, the temperature sensors present in meat containers
    and linked to the blockchain can assure the recipient that the temperature during
    the transfer never exceeded 4°C (De Giovanni, 2020b). Today, there are a wide
    variety of sensors available, some directly connected to the Internet and hence
    able to communicate directly to the blockchain, such as long-term evolution radios;
    others instead record the data and then transfer it once a connection is reached
    (Christidis et al., 2016). The main barriers to the implementation of the IoT
    are of economic in nature. Depending on the level of the technology used, both
    RFID chips and sensors can represent a significant investment to firms (Angeles,
    2005, Tian et al., 2016). The concept is that the investment in such devices is
    proportional to the value of the good to be traced and the entity of the damages
    that could arise in case of issues in the supply chain. Read-only RFID chips are
    already widely used even in retail stores and have a very low cost. Today some
    stores adopt them as a replacement to barcodes, due to faster checkout times and
    easier theft-identification (Wright, 2019). Table 1 summarizes the benefits or
    “enablers” of the blockchain technology as well as the barriers that might slow
    blockchain adoption.

- en: The basis for a blockchain-enabled supply chain begins with the creation or
    existence of a blockchain platform. The customized platform can be created through
    existing IT services providers such as IBM or Microsoft Azure. Such interfaces
    are complex and require the knowledge of an IT professional, which strongly affects
    the total costs of the implementation. The service of an IT professional is a
    recurring requirement because beyond the initial implementation, the system will
    require new smart contracts to be drafted, IoT sensors replaced, and system maintenance
    carried out. Despite cheaper, readily available solutions already existing, the
    explored products had a low level of customization, with some offering partial
    solutions often limited to the smart contracts trade aspects. The blockchain platform
    is linked directly to IoT sensors, described in the next paragraphs, logging data
    on a chronological basis. Any information stored on the network will be readily
    available to any person, including final consumers. Data is accessible through
    an authenticated web portal. Any information stored is attributable to single
    saffron or bulbs lots through quick response (QR) codes, in the case of individual
    saffron packages, and is easily accessible by individuals or RFID chips for bulb
    boxes, in order to further improve traceability of the bulbs. Regarding the use
    of smart contracts, according to the Italian legal requirements, any transaction
    or smart contract executed on the blockchain must comply with the digital signature
    standards to verify the effective signing of the agreements.

    stakeholders throughout the supply chain. Suppliers, business customers, and certification
    institutions should participate in the blockchain network with data from their
    activities or by emitting quality certificates about products directly on the
    blockchain in order to avoid possible falsification. In the interviews carried
    out with Arte Zafferano’s suppliers, the owners manifested the interest in greater
    supply chain traceability, but at the same time, they would not consider adopting
    a platform developed by Arte Zafferano; rather, they feel that the technology
    should be developed by a consortium and then adopted by the participant, to maximize
    collaboration.

    to impose the adoption of the blockchain platform to its suppliers or business
    customers. Hence, to answer the first research question, smaller enterprises might
    not be able to implement the blockchain technology by developing a custom solution,
    as it would be difficult to include supply chain stakeholders within the platform.
    The main consideration is that the implementation shall be brought forward by
    a group of SMEs where the larger size of the group leads to greater traceability.

- en: Saffron plants (Crocus Sativus), beyond producing the flower containing the
    precious pistils, yield around three bulbs per plant. Each of these parts is sold
    to other agricultural firms demanding bulbs. In the saffron industry, bulbs characteristics
    are fundamental, and the prices are strongly affected by their attributes. A larger
    bulb is always preferred to a smaller bulb. Moreover, the origin of the bulb is
    what confers the saffron its authenticity. A bulb purchased from the Netherlands
    and planted in Italy does not produce Italian Saffron. In order to be considered
    Italian, a bulb must have lived at least two years in Italian soil. Arte Zafferano
    specifies that such authenticity is usually certified; despite this, the bulbs
    market offers many “Italian bulbs” lacking certification. The sale of bulbs is
    an important aspect of the firm’s business and accounts for around 40% of yearly
    revenues. A regional institution demands that saffron nursery companies keep count
    of the bulbs being harvested, sold, or purchased in order to track the location
    of the bulbs and certify their origins. Such a bulbs register is on paper, and
    it is edited manually. The institution verifies such number at the end of the
    year. Farmers producing top-quality Italian saffron demand such certification,
    and origin-tracking methods used today are not reliable in guaranteeing the bulbs’
    origin. Furthermore, bulbs’ harvesting time and planting time are offset four
    months, during which such bulbs must be stored before being delivered to the client.
    Saffron plants’ yield is strongly related to storing conditions. A bulb must not
    be stocked outside of the soil for more than 90–150 days, as it may dry out. Moreover,
    to avoid possible infections, it must be stored in a dry place. Lastly, the warehousing
    temperature is fundamental. According to Arte Zafferano, a bulb stored between
    25°C and 27°C will have a greater yield. Today, such storing characteristics cannot
    be verified by business customers (farmers).

- en: The blockchain could enable for the storage of the bulbs registry on the distributed
    ledger, giving direct access to the regional institution that, once the numbers
    are verified, can release such certification directly on the blockchain. Because
    the blockchain is immutable and accessible to the entire supply chain, bulbs buyers
    can immediately verify the origin of the bulb, distinguishing them from non-certified
    bulbs available on the market. Furthermore, IoT sensors that are directly connected
    to the blockchain network can measure the humidity and temperature of the storing
    environment on the ledger. Bulbs buyers can then verify how the lot of purchased
    bulbs was stored, ensuring the maximum yield. RFID chips can play a role in tracking
    such bulbs lots. Such benefits would translate into a price premium, and would
    definitely enable Arte Zafferano to label its bulbs as top quality, increasing
    lot prices (1,000 bulbs) from the current price of 350 euro up to 400 euro, the
    unitary price for caliber-10, top-quality, guaranteed Italian bulbs. According
    to Arte Zafferano, an average of 40,000 bulbs are sold per year. A price increase
    would translate into an increase in revenues of around 2,000€.

    of the saffron as well as determinants of the fields-yield. Soil preparation before
    burying the bulbs plays a fundamental role. Soil nutrients, low moisture and a
    neutral PH are all fundamental characteristics for Crocus Sativus growth. Drought
    periods can compromise the harvest, as happened in 2017 for Arte Zafferano. Electrochemical
    sensors can detect soil PH and certain chemicals, while buried moisture sensors
    can detect soil humidity in different areas of the field. This ensures optimal
    conditions are present before the bulbs are planted and allows Arte Zafferano
    to intervene before the yield is compromised. Integrating such sensors into the
    blockchain network, the firms can store soil analysis data, making it accessible
    to the entire supply chain and—most importantly—to customers, who can trust there
    is an absence of chemical fertilizers and check the real cultivation conditions
    and procedures. Once the planting is complete, the same sensors can ensure correct
    monitoring activity, noticing when the field might require irrigation.

    saffron must be dried out. Humid saffron is heavier and hence generates more revenues
    at the expense of quality. In order to be sold, saffron stigmas may contain a
    maximum of 12% of water. The drying process, if carried out correctly, enhances
    the taste of the spice, but most importantly prevents the creation of mold in
    the product. Again, IoT moisture sensors can log saffron stigmas’ humidity throughout
    and after process to guarantee buyers the nature of the drying. Moreover, today
    Arte Zafferano cultivates saffron on two separate fields, which are located within
    the same geographical area. Plans to expand to a third and fourth field are limited
    by available personnel, which cannot be present on the field to monitor saffron
    growth. The set of soil monitoring IoT sensors could limit the firm’s needs to
    scale up as it can track terrain and field conditions remotely, and hence intervene
    only in case optimal farming conditions degrade.

    increase, as Arte Zafferano’s saffron stigmas are already sold at the highest
    price for such quality range. On the other hand, soil monitoring processes through
    IoT sensors would improve the yearly average yield, which was difficult to perform
    in 2017, when an in-depth soil analysis would have indicated the need for irrigation.
    According to Arte Zafferano, low-yield years take place statistically every five
    years due to drought or poor soil conditions. Over time, it would signify an increase
    in yearly average production of almost 10%.

    relies on external organizations for the production of saffron-tasting products
    such as honey and pasta. Because Arte Zafferano’s business is focused around organic-only
    products, it selects suppliers according to the certified organic nature of the
    products. Today, Arte Zafferano relies on two exclusive suppliers: one for honey
    and one for pasta. Due to the size of the business, Arte Zafferano inspects its
    supplier processes manually and relies exclusively on local firms. The participation
    to the blockchain network by supplier firms would allow Arte Zafferano to monitor
    processes remotely and continuously. Secondly, remote inspections can allow Arte
    Zafferano to expand suppliers’ choice beyond the geographical requirements, with
    the possibility of increasing its bargaining power and possibly having access
    to higher quality suppliers. Lastly, Arte Zafferano would be able to share retailing
    data, allowing for automatic stock replenishment without placing manual orders
    and leaving such products sold out. On the retail side, saffron consumers, through
    a simple QR code or even RFID chip, could access a web portal to inspect the entire
    supply chain processes of the saffron they are purchasing and consuming, guaranteeing
    the quality and origin of all inputs and the saffron itself. This would allow
    for the differentiation of superior quality saffron as produced by Arte Zafferano,
    discouraging consumers from purchasing low-quality saffron or facing counterfeit
    products.'

    offer the transparency of processes to any supply chain stakeholder. To fully
    harvest the benefits of such large information flows, the supply chain must implement
    one of the most important items: the smart contracts. Arte Zafferano shall digitalize
    all relationships with suppliers and customers. In the world of saffron, where
    quality and origin are essential characteristics, any trade contract provides
    terms defining the quality of the products. Digitizing such contracts through
    smart contracts would mean that any exchange between any two partners must be
    backed by quality guarantees provided by all the information gathered and stored
    on the blockchain. A smart contract between Arte Zafferano and the pasta supplier
    would complete the transaction where the organic characteristics are verified
    and hence an organic certificate is released on the blockchain network by the
    certification authority. The smart contract allows Arte Zafferano to check the
    external suppliers without the need for physical inspections, giving access to
    other companies (as far as they are accessible through the blockchain), increasing
    negotiation capability, and having the opportunity to improve its products.'

- en: The same relationships can be true between Arte Zafferano and its customers.
    Larger retailers purchase quantities of saffron from the different small producers
    to then aggregate, pack, and sell the stigmas. Such retailers give a minimum threshold
    in terms of saffron volumes because purchasing smaller quantities than 1 kg from
    each single retailer signifies carrying out quality inspections on a very large
    number of samples. Through the blockchain, Arte Zafferano would have recorded
    production processes and the obtained certifications on the immutable ledger.
    Through a smart contract, larger retailers can increase the trust towards smaller
    producers without the need to carry out singular inspections. This would allow
    Arte Zafferano to sell saffron wholesale without reaching the minimum threshold.
    In fact, selling directly to end consumers represents a burden for Arte Zafferano
    today because they must pack and sell the products to individual consumers, with
    much higher costs of sales.

    requires the hiring of a freelance IT engineer to develop and maintain the platform
    throughout the years. Speaking to an IT engineer, the construction of a blockchain
    network using currently available tools has an asking price of 80,000€ annually.
    Moreover, the blockchain requires great computational power distributed across
    different machines (distributed ledger); such services can be purchased from different
    companies such as IBM or Microsoft for which the cost is estimated in terms of
    computing hours. A company comparable to Arte Zafferano would require 750 computing
    hours per month. The implementation and ownership of a blockchain network goes
    beyond any plausible investment for a firm of Arte Zafferano’s size. Indeed, it
    would be far out of reach for the average European SMEs, which have a digitalization
    budget that actually covers only circa 20% of the required annual investment.

    surely represents a means to improve the process and transparency of SCM, allowing
    Arte Zafferano to differentiate its product and possibly gain a competitive advantage.
    The blockchain provided an increase in efficiency in terms of greater production
    as well as improving organizational capabilities. Despite such benefits, the implementation
    is quite challenging for small firms. The blockchain enablement of SMEs’ supply
    chain cannot happen individually, as the costs of the technology are still high
    if compared to the average budget allocated to digitalization.
  prefs: []

- en: The early stages of the technology translate into a low level of standardization
    in the solutions available on the market. The required customization and the complexity
    of the technology calls for the advice of expensive IT professionals to construct
    the links between the blockchain members, IoT sensors, and the creation of smart
    contracts. The cost–benefit analysis only considers the economic advantages received
    by the focus firm, Arte Zafferano, without considering the benefits extended to
    the other organization parts of the supply chain.

- en: Certain firms might benefit more from the implementation of the technology,
    up to the point of explaining the financial investment. Beyond the economic barriers,
    the implementation and the utility of the technology is limited by the intent
    of stakeholders to participate. A blockchain with a single participant will lose
    most of the benefits. In the case study, Arte Zafferano’s partners have denied
    the interest in participating in the construction of the network unless it is
    a spread practice where their supply chain partners also adopt it. Hence, the
    implementation should not start from the single company but rather should be planned
    by a group of partnered SMEs.

- en: Despite positively answering one of the research questions, the case study has
    demonstrated that investing in the blockchain as a mean of supply chain management
    may not be economically viable for smaller enterprises due to the current costs
    of implementing such solutions. Furthermore, the implementation framework used
    by larger enterprises cannot be currently applied to many SMEs. Contrarily, the
    numerous benefits analysed and the improvements contributed by the technology
    cannot be disregarded. The main cost is the construction of the actual blockchain
    network, the backbone to which firms, part of the same supply chain, are linked
    in order to transact and share information. This means that for a multiplicity
    of firms the required blockchain is one, and hence the core investment could well
    be shared among the participants. It is the role of institutional bodies or consortiums
    to promote the implementation of such system. Blockchain policies analysed aim
    exactly at building a central blockchain network to which all SMEs can subscribe
    and hence trade with one another. While the most complete idea is in the Australian
    National Blockchain, the project is still far from being realized (Australian
    Government, 2019). Solutions like We.Trade are also premature, compared to what
    SMEs might currently need. Future research should aim in the direction of a unified
    blockchain network provided by an institution, similar to what has been done with
    unified citizens portals such as the Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale (SPID)
    in Italy, an easy-to-use standardized common platform. Today, Italian SMEs are
    falling behind in digitalization, and the effect is amplifying as innovation proceeds.
    A substantial investment in a breakthrough solution could represent a shortcut
    to increase the competitivity of Italian SMEs on the global market as well as
    protect the “Made in Italy” label, recovering part of the economic damages. Such
    direction in future research implies much broader studies, which shall make sense
    from a technical, economical, and organizational point of view, understanding
    whether the requirements of individual SMEs can be satisfied by a unique blockchain
    infrastructure.

- en: Despite the infeasibility of the implementation, considering common implementation
    frameworks, the advantages that the technology can bring to SMEs is notable. The
    blockchain can improve trust for consumers in smaller enterprises by providing
    full transparency of their activities as well as the complete traceability of
    the supply chain. The blockchain can translate into a significative competitive
    advantage but most importantly would allow traceable products to be differentiated
    from lower quality or counterfeit ones. A well-spread adoption of the technology
    might allow the Italian economy to recover part of the damages inflicted by counterfeiting
    and other unfair practices. For this purpose, further research must be carried
    out into the development of a blockchain infrastructure to which individual SMEs
    can connect to trace their activities and trade among each other to create a unique
    ecosystem able to guarantee Italian products all around the world.
