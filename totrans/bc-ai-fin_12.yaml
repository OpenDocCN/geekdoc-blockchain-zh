    is something that would be appear to be something of a contradiction. Making effective
    decisions, be it choices linked to investment strategy or audit efficiency, require
    that the decision makers involved be able to drill down and ascertain exactly
    which pieces of data are the most important. The simple reality, however, is that
    as business continues to become more fluid, digitized, and global in nature ambiguity
    will continue to increase. Especially since it does not look like some of the
    hard trends – such as changing demographics, political instability, and a rebalancing
    of how business is conducted on a global basis, will be changing anytime soon,
    it seems reasonable to expect that the profession will have to evolve in order
    to keep pace.

    continues to produce vast quantities of data is that most of this information
    is appearing in an unstructured format. This is not to say that this no structure
    or formatting associated with this information, but that the structures and formatting
    that are involved do not sync with, or match, traditional sources of financial
    information such as Excel, .CSV files, or other sorts of standardized exported
    data sets. Without the integration of tools such as RPA and artificial intelligence
    into the decision making process, it appears reasonable to expect that professionals
    will need to become more used to dealing with these types of information by leveraging
    the efficiencies generated by using AI. This is not merely an academic conversation,
    however, as the tools to make effective use of that information are already in
    existence in the marketplace, taking the form of software companies such with

    landscape and practitioners employed therein will have to keep pace. Returning
    to the concept of an audit or other attestation engagement, there do appear to

    One merely just needs to observe and look at the end result of when accounting
    professionals engaged in creative practices at organizations such as Enron, WorldCom,
    Tyco, and numerous other examples. It is true that those examples are nearly 20 years
    in the past, but there are more recent examples of accounting missteps and questionable
    guidance that drove underperformance and ultimately failures at organizations
    such as CountryWide, and Lehman Brothers. On a financial markets side, examples
    abound of organizations that – either through misapplication of technology or
    miscommunication between different parts of the organization, have ultimately
    also faced missteps and errors when expanding into new areas. The London Whale,
    flash crashes, and various other instances of market inaccuracy or overreaction

    to become more widespread, and attracts the investment dollars of various institutional
    investors, this will invariably create opportunities for new revenue and client
    facing tasks. Simultaneously, the very fact that the blockchain and broader cryptoasset
    class is so new and fast moving also creates loopholes and openings for unethical
    actors to take advantage of enthusiastic, but ill-informed investors. Mentioned
    throughout this text, the educational and informational between what investors
    and clients know about these different technologies and platforms, and what they
    should be aware in terms of investment risk and reward represents a unique situation
    for practitioners. That said, and acknowledging the reality that new opportunities
    will have both upside and downside risk embedded therein, the importance of traditional
    fiduciary and financial advisory services will continue to increase. At a basic
    level, the sheer amount of funds allocated to this space – totaling the hundreds
    of billons of dollars – means that financial professionals should be involved.

    virtually always a recommended course of action, in the current marketplace it
    also appears to be a requirement. Driven by increasingly active and engaged regulators,
    the marketplace for professionals able to deliver guidance connected to both current
    and future crypoasset implications will continue to increase. Even with the advent
    and implementation of these advanced technologies among financial and nonfinancial

    in the market, has been besieged by doubts and worries connected to whether or
    not the stablecoin itself is actually collateralized by the assets claimed by
    management. This ongoing conversation and debate between different members of
    the market, on both sides of the equation, points to a unique market opportunity
    for financial professionals, specifically the accounting subset of the profession.
    Prior to examining the implications of Tether on the financial services marketplace
    as a whole, it seems logical to first analyze and compare the difference between
    an audit and attestation. Accounting professionals, once again, are not always
    associated with proactive or forward looking advice or guidance, but the work
    performed during an audit and attestation engagement certainly has a role to play
    as cryptocurrencies and blockchain become more and more well established.

    testing of both the financial statements of an organization and the internal controls
    of an organization. In addition to the testing and review of financial information
    itself, auditors and other external accounting professionals will perform numerous
    other processes to ensue the accuracy and validity of the reported data. Including,
    but not limited to substantive testing, analytical procedures, information counts,
    confirmations, and valuation tests, these processes extrapolate the conformity
    of financials (in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) from
    the sample that is tested. In addition to the work and testing performed on the
    financial results and statements of the organization, there is also an audit and
    examination performed over the internal controls of the firm. While it is true
    that the responsibility for the development of the internal control system does
    indeed lie with management, external auditors are brought in to audit and provide
    assurances that the systems as designed and reported are being implemented as
    management has indicated.

- en: An attestation engagement provides practitioners and management teams more flexibility
    with regards to what specific work is actually being performed during the engagement.
    For example, an audit should include the entirety of the financial statements
    and the entire system of internal controls, whereas an attestation engagement
    may focus on a specific piece of information or data. Different pieces of information,
    or even individual financial statements can be subject or included in an attestation
    engagement, and this includes the opportunities for audit and accounting professionals.
    This broader scope of possible work functions and interactions with clients will
    inevitably extend to the blockchain and cryptocurrency marketplace as well as
    traditional engagements. That said, it does seem important to revisit an example
    of how, even with increased accounting and financial services interest in the
    blockchain and cryptocurrency space, issues and obstacles can still arise.
  prefs: []

- en: Diving deep into the issues and obstacles that popped up at Tether during 2018
    the core issue that did arise seemed to be directly connected to the core value
    proposition of how its product, USDT, functions in the marketplace. Returning
    to the pitch and value of the stablecoin in the market, the reduced volatility
    associated with a stablecoin versus untethered or unpegged cryptocurrencies, an
    underlying reality quickly becomes apparent. In order for a stablecoin to function
    and work as advertised, there has to be confidence that the coin itself it actually
    pegged or tethered appropriately. In the case of a coin or token that is pegged
    or tethered to the USD, as USDT is, a core part of the pitch is that the organization
    actually has the underlying dollars to stabilize the currency. Different types
    of stablecoins may be stabilized differently, but in the case of a coin pegged
    to the USD this means that the organization must possess adequate dollar reserves
    to stabilize the coin during periods of market volatility.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An issue that continued to arise and plague the organization throughout the
    year was the fact that while Tether  indicated and continued to state that every
    token or coin was stabilized on a 1:1 basis by dollars, no audited financial statements
    had been issued. Again, while not necessarily a new service line or work opportunity
    this points to the importance of updating, adapting, and evolving current lines
    and work opportunities to meet the needs of a changing marketplace. An audit involves,
    as mentioned above, a robust examination and testing of both financial statements,
    as well as the internal controls in place at an organization. In the case of an
    organization such as Tether issuing a stablecoin, the importance of a functioning
    robust system of internal controls is difficult to overstate. In addition to the
    rather obvious implications from a financial fraud or other unethical activity
    perspective it is also necessary for both management professionals employed at
    these organizations and external financial services professionals to have confidence
    in the accuracy of the information published and disseminated by the organization.
  prefs: []

- en: At the core of the issue was the reality that, even though the organization
    indicated they had dollar reserves to match and underpin the coins and tokens
    issued, there was not an audit performed. Instead the organization issued statements
    to the marketplace as well as select banking and other financial data in an attempt
    to assuage market fears and doubts. Even with these steps, however, confidence
    in the ability of management to actually produce the financial information required
    by the marketplace continued to decline and drop during 2018\. It was only toward
    the very end of 2018 that, via investigative reporting by Bloomberg, that even
    information was gathered to piece together an accurate view as to the financial
    conditions at the firm. It was worth noting that, even though this information
    did eventually enter the marketplace, it was not distributed by the organization,
    which does continue to raise concerns about the transparency and clarity that
    market actors can provide to the market at large.

    blockchain and cryptocurrency space, but it does point to the need for transparency
    and clarity with regards to what exactly is happening with regards to different
    iterations of blockchain and cryptoassets. Even though these technologies are
    exciting, revolutionary, and do appear to represent a definitive shift from the
    ways in which financial data, there is certainly a need for financial professionals
    to provide services linked to these different assets. Accounting practitioners,
    for example, must be able to address some of the core issues related to the lack
    of accounting standards and reporting frameworks in the marketplace. If cryptocurrencies
    are ever to achieve broader appeal and adoption throughout, accounting practitioners
    must be able to accurately assess and report the correct methodology to value,
    report, and disseminate said information.

    regulation and regulatory scrutiny will assist the crypto market and financial
    practitioners at large. While numerous regulatory organizations have issued proclamations
    and statements as of this writing, financial markets seem to still be treating
    different cryptocurrencies as an emerging asset class then a viable alternative
    asset class. Market forces, perhaps in advance of regulatory guidance and information,
    seem to be taking matters in stride via developments at financial institutions.
    That said, the clarity and guidance that inevitably emerge as a result of increased
    certainty will allow financial market makers to offer more insightful guidance
    and different types of advice to clients. For example, and only realistically
    possible with increased guidance and standard setting, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    could assume the role of alternative assets and investments currently held by
    commodities, gold, and other types of assets not classified as traditional equity
    options.

    practitioners might even actively encourage and seek out regulation, guidance,
    and other types or activities not normally associated with what financial markets
    desire. Interestingly enough, however, the increased regulation and other apparently
    restrictive guidance and information may actually reduce volatility and seemingly
    unconnected market moves that do tend to occur in the cryptocurrency marketplace.
    On top of the reduced volatility linked to different cryptocurrencies, increased
    certainty and clarity tied to the marketplace itself opens the door to additional
    opportunities and service lines. Specifically, some of the most exciting and market
    moving developments connected to the blockchain space itself are not always connected
    to cryptocurrencies themselves, but the additional lines and options that blockchain
    enables. Taking into account the market realities driving the billions in investment
    and institutional interest already underway for blockchain development. An additional
    facet of reporting and different class of information enabled by broader blockchain
    implementation and development is the ability of firms to report broader classes
    of information. One area that is rapidly growing and emerging is how the rise
    of technology options can facilitate increased reporting across a variety of different
    areas. Figure [10.1](#Fig1) presents, at a high level, some of the possibilities
    and opportunity enabled by more real time and continuous reporting and technology.![../images/467992_1_En_10_Chapter/467992_1_En_10_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_10_Chapter/467992_1_En_10_Fig1_HTML.png)

    environment overall is the change in the types and amounts of information that
    are increasingly expected of financial professionals in an environment that continues
    to evolve and change (Shoaf et al. [2018](#CR9)). While integrated reporting has
    become a headline factor and a topic in the economic conversation at large, the
    adoption and implementation of this idea by accounting and finance firms has been
    slower than might have otherwise been expected. This can be attributed to a number
    of factors, but perhaps one of the most logical reasons as to his lack of adoption
    has to do with the technology currently in use by most practitioners. Although
    the need for more detailed and comprehensive data on how an organization is performing
    is relatively well known at this point, technology tools and platforms have –
    for the most part – yet to catch up to market needs and expectations. Artificial
    intelligence, the rise of the internet of things, and blockchain technology are
    changing this reality on the ground, and increasingly enabling organizations and
    financial professionals the ability to deliver and analyze broader and more comprehensive
    types of data and information. Prior to taking advantage of technology to offer
    and deliver on the potential of these more comprehensive reporting platforms and
    other services, however, it is important to both revisit the concept of integrated
    reporting, and comment on the concept of a benefit corporation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the core of the idea, the concept of a benefit corporation appears to represent
    almost an ideal merger and representation of how sustainability is being incorporated
    in financial services practices and protocols in the current marketplace (Zhou
    et al. [2017](#CR10)). The specific benefit corporation rules and processes will
    vary from state to state, but the core of the idea can be summarized as follows.
    A benefit corporation, via inclusion within the corporate charter, operating agreement,
    or other form of corporate bylaws and policies, includes the prioritization of
    sustainability as well as other social and governance related activities with
    equal weighting as the financial goals of the organization. These goals and policies
    will vary from firm to firm but can be focused on the environmental impact of
    organizational operations on the broader community, social policies aimed at range
    of societal goals in alignment with organizational beliefs, and the different
    aspects and ranges of governance that are often raised as both potential opportunities
    and challenges to organizations in the marketplace. Implications that can result
    from the desire to implement such a managerial model can include, but are not
    limited to following.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, if an organization wishes to grant equal importance to traditionally
    qualitative issues like governance, environmental matter, or different socially
    oriented agenda items, the firm must be able to accurately measure, rank, and
    track these different types of information. Specifically, and linking back to
    the core topic of this book, the organization must have both the technology tools
    themselves as well the personnel to leverage these tools effectively. For example,
    linking an automation, robotic process automation initiative, or a full blown
    artificial intelligence project to the increasing streams of data already produced
    by the organization in any case represents a method by which current data can
    actually be made more useful for business decision making purposes. While that
    in and of itself may seem rather obvious, the technology tools to enable such
    an undertaking have only recently become available in the marketplace. Financial
    professionals should, especially as traditional compliance, reporting, and analysis
    tasks become augment or fully automated, be looking for opportunities to expand
    service offerings into new lines and areas of business (Bouten and Hoozée [2015](#CR2)).
    The rise of interest in more comprehensive reporting models such as benefit corporations,
    as well as the need for practitioners to meet the needs of the marketplace, will
    invariably converge in the arena of assisting organizations in the creation and
    issuance of said reporting models and structures.
  prefs: []

- en: Second the full integration of sustainability goals and policies into the corporate
    decision making process will lead to a market generated need and expectation that
    corporations and the management professionals running these firms have the ability
    to not only produce and analyze larger and more varied amounts of information,
    but also make effective business decisions as a result of this information. The
    ability of the organization to make effective decisions with a larger base and
    pool of available information is, for lack of a more appropriate term, a requirement
    of organizations seeking to fully accrue the benefits of establishing a benefit
    corporation mindset or even simply implementing a more robust reporting and analysis
    framework. Financial professionals have an opportunity here as well. In essence,
    the core duty and responsibility of financial services professionals to most organizations
    has revolved around the ability of these practitioners to analyze organizational
    information, and to also effectively summarize said information to both the management
    team of the firm and external end users. Such an expectation and market need has
    been reduced simply because sustainability issues have become more mainstream.
    Rather, as the variety and quantity of data at the disposal of organizations has
    continued to increase, the need for high quality decision making has only increased.

    fiduciary responsibility of any financial services professional, and this responsibility
    does not appear to be changing with the growing implementation of new business
    entity types. Although the conversation surrounding benefit corporations may seem
    like an odd inclusion into a text focusing on emerging technologies, upon further
    review it is not as contradictory as it might initially appear Hemphill and Cullari
    [2014](#CR4)). For example, in order to obtain either the b-corp certification
    (from B Lab) or change the choice of entity to that of a benefit corporation,
    the organization must produce additional information on top of the regular financial
    statements already reported to the marketplace. Prior to drilling into those specific
    reporting requirements, however, it seems appropriate to differentiate between
    benefit corporations and the B-corp certification.

- en: Benefit corporations represent an additional choice of entity that is available
    to management professionals when organization and managing a business. Although
    it is an additional choice of entity at the state level, it is important to note
    that the selection of this business structure and entity classification does not
    generate accretive tax benefits for the organization itself (Benson et al. [2018](#CR1)).
    Rather, it is choice of entity, governed by state legislation and reporting requirements,
    that an organization may voluntarily choice to embrace. As a requirement of this
    choice of entity, the organization must also agree to the publication and distribution
    of a benefit report, deliverable at least to the state legislature and possibly
    additional stakeholders depending on the market itself. This, in addition to imposing
    regulatory and accountability onto the organization to indeed operate in a manner
    consistent with the benefit corporation corporate charter, also points to the
    need for improved technology solutions. Put simply, in order to generate, collect,
    and report the vast array of data and information required to assemble and communicate
    a benefit corporation report, the entity must have access to these different classes
    of information on a continuous basis. This opens the door to both different technology
    solutions including the leveraging of RPA and other automation tools to gather
    and analyze this information as well as attracting investment opportunities overall.

    operate in a sustainable manner. For organizations and management professionals
    seeking to generate additional and accretive value, appealing to this ever increasing
    market segment is a logical approach. Specifically, financial services professionals
    will be able, by leveraging and explaining the implications of different technology
    tools, appeal and address the expectations of management teams seeking more forward
    looking and business oriented advice from financial professionals. Simply because
    technology is playing an increasingly important role the management decision making
    process does not mean that all iterations have to be directly linked to technology
    functionality. Using technology and the disruption generated by increased technology
    integration represents a quantitative method by which financial professionals
    can seize upon this interest to add value in potentially unexpected areas. With
    all of that said, however, this book does indeed focus on technology itself, and

    together, the potential upside for this communication is dramatic. Drilling down
    specifically to the financial services industries, the following subsets can certainly
    benefit from increased transparency and collaboration of information:'

    of the very nature of the insurance business, or sharing data and information
    between counterparties, establishing and maintaining a common platform and language
    makes logical sense. Circling back, and layering on top of the operational benefits
    able to be generated from the time savings with a common information platform,
    insurance organizations do indeed have billions of premiums that need to be invested.

    a blockchain based – or even blockchain supported – solution to address some of
    these issues, it will position the firm to achieve a leadership oriented role
    moving forward.

    and acquisitions, and generally purchasing goods and services at the global level
    often does require financing terms, contracts, and conditions that involve multiple
    counterparties and organizations. Financial services professionals can either
    implement internal solutions or provide templates and services to external clients
    seeking to implement blockchain or artificial intelligence based solutions in
    the marketplace.

    intelligence, but that does not mean that those are the only topics and trends
    analyzed within this text. Technology, no matter how disruptive or potentially
    paradigm shifting in nature that it may be, is not going to change business or
    improve performance in and of itself. Stated another way, the technology tools
    in and of themselves are not going to meet the needs of stakeholders and external
    users of financial data. For financial services professionals to actually add
    increased value, analyze broader business trends, and evolve into a strategic
    partner, technology tools will need to be adapted to the needs of clients both
    current and future. One of the largest and most well-funded, from a financial
    perspective, shifts and changes underway at client organizations is the importance
    of sustainability and sustainable investing. Taking full advantage of the increased
    efficiency, better data security, and enhanced reporting ability that can be generated
    via these tools allows practitioners to successfully meet this market need. Whether
    it is integrated reporting, sustainability reporting and other affiliated information,
    or being able to effectively analyze ESG related ETF’s and other financial investments,
    these options are items that professionals need to both be aware of and understand
    for client advice and recommendations.
