  zh: 摘要
- en: This chapter explores the drawbacks of conventional centralized share exchange
    frameworks, like those of higher transaction costs, central and vulnerable regulation
    to exploitation, and lack of revelation to business behavior and practices by
    introducing a revolutionary model that utilizes blockchain to establish a decentralized
    stock exchange and a transparent persistent economy. The suggested model utilizes
    exclusive contracts to implement the validity of the privileges of the owner and
    the proper accomplishment and settlement of the transactions, thereby mitigating
    the need for a centralized authority to ensure the accuracy of the stock exchange
    mechanism. The experimental findings convincingly demonstrate that the decentralized
    solution can provide lower transaction costs by progressively replacing brokerage
    costs and centralized officials' commissions with mining charges, which reward
    the miners for their backbreaking work in maintaining the system and enforcing
    the laws.

  zh: 简介
- en: A stock exchange is a platform in which stock brokers and dealers may purchase
    and exchange assets such as stock and bond shares as well as other investment
    funds. These security measures and financial activities including the payment
    of profits and dividends can be given and repaid by shares markets as well. To
    start a company, we need some amount of capital or income (Donald, 2012). For
    this purpose, the business is split into small parts that are called inventories
    and are sold legally, which is referred to as shares. The individual who owns
    the stock is deemed an investor or a shareholder. Thus they would be considered
    as a tiny part of the company. The exchange and management of stock therefore
    is conducted out in the Share / Stock Market. The auctioning process was manual
    before the advent of Internet but now it’s all digital (Bala, 2013).

    2012）。为此，企业被分割成称为库存的小部分，并且合法出售，这被称为股份。拥有股票的个人被视为投资者或股东。因此，他们将被视为公司的一小部分。因此，股票的交易和管理在股票市场进行。在互联网出现之前，拍卖过程是手动的，但现在全部都是数字化的（Bala,

- en: If one wants to invest in the share market, he/she must have a good idea about
    the stakeholders that exist in the share market. The major entities in the stock
    market include the investors or the traders, stock brokers, exchanges and the
    clearing corporations. A broker is a person that acts an intermediary between
    the investor and the exchange. The companies that raise money by issuing shares
    to the public get listed on the exchanges. Through the IPO (Initial Public Offering),
    shares are issued to the investors in the primary market and once IPO gets over,
    the company is listed on the exchange that gives an opportunity for trading in
    the shares. For instance if one wants to purchase the shares of a company say
    like Colgate or Royal Enfield, he can buy it from the exchange any time once the
    IPOs are conducted only for a period of 3 days. After that duration, one can trade
    in shares only through the secondary market. It is the place where all shares
    get traded and the stock markets are regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange
    Board of India). It is essential for any trader or investor to understand what
    is NSE and BSE in share market and the difference between the two before putting
    a step in the stock market. NSE and BSE are the major national exchanges in India.
    We can trade in stocks by opening a demat or trading account with a depository
    participant or stockbroker. The organization establishes itself at BSE / NSE in
    the first place. If the shareholder has enough industry experience, it will directly
    contact the dealer through the marketplace to purchase the shares and if the consumer
    has the inadequate industry knowledge, they would require the help of third party
    financial advisor who may charge some amount and further help them in transacting
    in the shares accordingly.

- en: The Financial Broker or the Stock Broker is the one who has comprehensive understanding
    and access to the market. He can study and guide people in appropriate ways to
    invest in the market according to ones’ requirements and preferences, thus preventing
    one from exhausting legal work. Financial analysts can save us from a lot of financial
    liabilities. For this to be done the broker may charge some amount of fees. But
    apart from this positive aspect, there are some negatives also. Suppose the broker
    gets an incentive from a specific lender for selling their shares (Brunnermeier
    & Pedersen, 2009), then the brokers’ ultimate goal would be to sell that share
    first and get the incentive without being considerate to the investor. There will
    also be a situation where the financial advisor finds the best value for money
    according to him and you wouldn't find it worth the money. Investing with the
    help of a broker may blur the portrait of what is genuinely the market value and
    profit margin of the share and what is the commission of the share, and therefore
    sometimes you probably end up paying far more additional money than actually investing.
    Brokers also do not offer forecasts, which may result in a lossy investment. Sometimes
    in the final analysis, some corporations don't function with brokers, they sell
    their shares on their own, and you might even never know about them and end up
    investing something that may not be worth enough.

    & Pedersen, 2009），那么经纪人的最终目标将是首先卖出那些股份并获得激励，而不考虑投资者。还会有这样的情况，即金融顾问根据他的看法找到了最具价值的金钱，而你却认为不值得。在经纪人的帮助下进行投资可能会模糊市场价值和利润率以及股份佣金的真实图像，因此有时你可能最终会支付比实际投资更多的额外费用。经纪人也不提供预测，这可能导致投资损失。有时在最终分析中，一些公司不会与经纪人合作，他们自己出售股份，而你甚至可能永远不会知道它们，最终投资了一些可能不值得的东西。

    in the tragic loss of shareholders assets. Many activities, such as fake companies,
    emerging or newly born markets and guaranteeing stakeholders highly liquid returns
    while subsequently employing it for their internal purposes. Such activities betray
    customers and by the end of the day resulting in events like bankruptcy, ultimately
    causing financial losses to the people. Some of the firms have artificially higher
    share prices before the privileges were allegedly issued by circular trading (Gupta,
    1992). There is, furthermore, a lack of genuine traders, as the number of investors
    is speculators, which can effectively be observed by the fundamental fact that
    they reluctantly produce a revenue profit from short-term volatility not really
    for investment purposes. Investors are often naïve and hence they fail to notice
    that the share certificate they have got is fraudulent. Inside trading seems to
    remain a widespread phenomenon in the marketplace, i.e. responsible individuals
    from within may come to know any valuable information and therefore advertise
    and purchase it at nominal rates, thereby causing an appalling loss to the leading
    vendor. Although many legal steps have been promptly taken and also many rules
    and bureaucratic regulations are being formulated but then too it is the widespread
    practice scrupulously observed. Unofficial trading typically comprises.

    undoubtedly holds a primary concern as the capital market is not so transparent
    and building up trust is crucial. Any possible breach can occur due to an apparent
    lack of profound knowledge (Adrian & Shin, 2010) & (Adrian et al., 2014). Therefore,
    for a modern market, we demand something that may help tremendously to establish
    a trustful and transparent platform so that one can invest freely and hence support
    the economic growth. Trust is not gained in a day but is developed over a period

  zh: 区块链简介
- en: Blockchain is one of the evolving technology worldwide. It helps to maintain
    trust and additionally provides transparency in a system. It maintains mutual
    trust by decentralizing the system by using peer to peer network. Blockchain is
    principally a chain of Blocks that are connected to one and another consequently
    crafting a piece of persistent information. Every logical block possesses a common
    data, its hash and also the hash of the previous block to maintain a block (Sutcliffe,
    2017). The data of the block typically depend on the specific type of Blockchain
    we want to efficiently create. Let's examine an example of the BITCOIN – it typically
    holds the detail of the sender, receiver, amount, date and time, etc. The hash
    value is created by traditionally using a hash function that encrypts the data
    in a particular form that if ever the hash of the data is allegedly breached it
    cannot sufficiently restore the sensitive data from the hash. It is principally
    of 128 bits. It gallantly helps to positively identify the data and therefore
    maintain the uniqueness of the key block. Thus for Blockchain, we can say that
    it requires precisely sufficient proof of work. It intentionally slows down the
    effective mechanism of addition of irrelevant and making it steady and reliable
    (Asharaf & adarsh, 2017). Thus we can say, “Blockchain is a decentralized, distributive,
    public ledger.”

    laws that must be carefully reviewed and settled upon (Satyavolu & Sangamnerkar,
    2016). Therefore, an evidentiary arrangement can be accurately interpreted as
    a unique set of standard protocols. As with contracts, such agreements are recorded
    in the blockchain. In the future, transaction requests will activate them, which
    will wisely decide whether each entity updates its status, based on the possible
    outcomes accomplished by the smart contract. But even if the word ' contract'
    is used, the intelligent contracts can be considered as representatives that can
    be sufficiently established and operated on and activated sometime through effective
    implementation. Intelligent contracts aim to substitute actual-world third-party
    individuals (judge, authorized officers, escrows, etc.) with a rational entity
    operating efficiently under a predefined set of fundamental laws (Abeyratne &
    Monfared, 2016). The distinctive features of an intelligent contract are very
    reliant on its context. At present, NXT (Aitzhan & Svetinovic, 2016), Side Chain
    (Hendricks & Singhal, 2009), Hyper-ledger and Ethereum (Sajana et al., 2018) remain
    by far the most standard booklets that generously offer ample opportunity to establish
    smart contracts. Ethereum is among them the most experienced and technologically
    advanced in smart contract research. It is a distributed ledger framework that
    offers several remarkable improvements in computer algorithms and Ethereum blockchain
    architectures for consensus.
