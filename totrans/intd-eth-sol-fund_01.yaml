    world can be challenging. This book is your guide. Before we get started, let’s
    define some of the terms you’ll encounter aheadA blockchain is a fully-distributed,
    peer-to-peer software network which makes use of cryptography to securely host
    applications, store data, and easily transfer digital instruments of value that
    represent real-world money. Cryptography is the art of communication via coded
    messages. In Bitcoin and Ethereum, cryptography is used to conjur one secure computing
    environment out of thousands of similar machines, running with no central authority
    and no single owner. With that kind of potential, it’s obvious why the technology
    has been subject to unprecedented speculation, hype, confusion, and prognostication.The
    term “Ethereum” can be used refer to three distinct things: the Ethereum protocol,
    the Ethereum network created by computers using the protocol, and the Ethereum
    project funding development of the aforementioned two. On the heels of Bitcoin,
    Ethereum has become its own macrocosm, attracting enthusiasts and engineers from
    numerous industries. Many of civilization’s most nagging imperfections could become
    the domain of blockchain’s killer apps, and the Ethereum protocol (which was derived
    from Bitcoin, and extended) is widely considered to be the network where these
    “distributed” apps will spring up. For developers, designers, and product managers,
    there’s no better time to begin prototyping applications for the Ethereum network.'

    more specifically: application developers interested in building products and

    perhaps owing to work or interest in financial services, consulting, insurance,
    law, game creation, government, logistics, product design, or IT.[¹](#Fn1) This
    book is similarly cross-disciplinary. It provides a contextual guide for programmers
    and non-programmers alike to develop ideas about what to build, and how to build
    it. It fills a gap between computer science, economics, financial services, and
    where necessary, banking history.For programmers, the challenging thing about
    Ethereum isn’t usually the code; like most open source software projects, this
    one has on-ramps for people who already program in other environments. Rather,
    the challenge is wrapping your head around the concept of “cryptoeconomics,” or
    the system of incentives and disincentives which secure the network.For nonprogrammers,
    the challenge is divining how the ecosystem will develop, and how you fit in.
    Claims that blockchains will modernize the banking system, revolutionize insurance,
    and lay waste to counterfeiting may be overblown—but by how much?[²](#Fn2)'

    are kits that allow you to pop up an economic system in software, complete with
    account management and a native unit of exchange to pass between accounts. Kind
    of like the game Monopoly . People call these native units of exchange coins,
    tokens, or cryptocurrencies, but they’re no different from tokens in any other
    system: they’re a form of money (or scrip) that is usable only within that system.Blockchains
    work something like mesh networks or local area networks (LANs); they are merely
    connected to other “peer” computers running the same software. When you want to
    make one of these peer-to-peer (P2P) networks accessible through a web browser,
    you need to use special software libraries such as Web3.js to connect an application’s
    front end (the GUI you see in a browser), via JavaScript APIs, to its back end
    (the blockchain).In Ethereum, you can take this concept one step further by easily
    writing financial contracts with other users inside the system. As you’ll see,
    these financial contracts are called smart contracts .'

    which you’ll learn about in Chapter [4](A433414_1_En_4_Chapter.html). Turing completeness
    was an advantage that many developers quickly latched onto, but more important
    is Ethereum’s ability to save state. In computing, a simple definition of a stateful
    system is one that can detect changes to information and remember them over time.Imagine
    a computer with no hard drive; you couldn’t do much with it. It would be like
    a calculator, the contents of its memory fleeting. The ability to engineer interactions
    between users in the future, and under certain conditions, is a powerful addition
    to a blockchain. It allows developers to introduce control flow into cryptocurrency
    transaction programming. This is the biggest distinction between Ethereum and
    Bitcoin, but not the only one, as you’ll see.NoteControl flow refers to the order
    in which computing instructions are executed or evaluated. Examples are conditional
    statements (if this, then that) and loops (which run repeatedly until certain
    conditions are met).In Bitcoin , all transactions happen as soon as possible.
    Because of Bitcoin’s lack of statefulness, it has to execute transactions all
    in one go. The blockchain as envisioned by Bitcoin’s creator(s) was a distributed
    transaction ledger that kept a running tally of everyone’s bitcoin balances in
    the network. (A stylistic note for close readers: Bitcoin the network is written
    in the uppercase, and bitcoin the token in lowercase.) In Ethereum, a similar
    system is made extensible in a standardized way.Secondarily, this common scripting
    language makes it more straightforward for blockchains that share the Ethereum
    protocol to share data with one another, enabling groups that use separate blockchains
    to share information and value with each other.What is a Protocol?If you’re new
    to software development, a 10-second crash course in information technology (IT)
    will be useful here. IT can be defined as the study of computer systems to store,
    edit, retrieve, and send information.[⁴](#Fn4) How that information is represented
    and updated over time, to reflect changes internal and external, depends on which
    technological system is in use.In a telecommunications context, a protocol is
    a system of rules that describes how a computer (and its programmer) can connect
    to, participate in, and transmit information over a system or network. These instructions
    define code syntax and semantics that the system expects. Protocols can involve
    hardware, software, and plain-language instructions. No special hardware is needed
    for Ethereum, and the software is entirely free.In Ethereum, the protocol is designed
    for building decentralized applications, with emphasis on rapid development time,
    security, and interactivity.'

    specific ability of this network database to reconcile the order of transactions,
    even when a few nodes on the network receive transactions in various order.This
    usually happens because of network latency due to physical distance; for example,
    a transaction created by a user buying a hot dog in Tokyo will be dispatched first
    to nodes in Japan. By the time a node in New York gets word of this transaction
    a few milliseconds later, a nearby transaction in Brooklyn sneaks in “ahead” of
    the one in Tokyo. These inconsistencies due to subjective perspective in distributed
    systems is what makes them a challenge to scale. The power of blockchain systems

    added distributed consensus to this innovation with the creation of Bitcoin in
    2009.Together, these three elements can mimic a simple database that is decentralized

    a functioning colony, you can think of Bitcoin as a machine. In computing terms,

    benefits from knowledge of both economic and programming concepts. This book contains
    definitions for both, where necessary.With a radically different perspective to
    that of the creators of Bitcoin, the Ethereum creators implicitly took the position
    that cryptocurrency , if it exists in the future, will not be one decentralized
    system. Instead, it will be a distributed network of decentralized systems, enabling
    many different cryptographic tokens of value, with various purposes and interpretations
    to be easily and quickly defined and then brought to life.

    for further information has probably brought you to the conclusion that Bitcoin
    is essentially a global Ponzi scheme. Let’s put this to rest.You are half correct:
    the value of a bitcoin is determined by the market for bitcoins. Sure, certain
    bitcoin-holding entities have obtained domestic money transmitter licenses and
    will redeem your bitcoins for US dollars, Euros, gold, or other fiat currency.
    But these entities are private businesses that charge fees and could go out of
    business at any time.So, Bitcoin and networks like it are vulnerable only to the
    extent that there is no “redeemer of last resort,” no trusted (governmental or
    corporate) entity you can be sure will redeem your bitcoins or ether for US dollars
    in the future. Short of paying a private money changer, the only option for converting
    bitcoins to something of real value is to connect to an online exchange and trade
    the coins for fiat currency, thus finding another buyer.Just as the Bitcoin network
    moves bitcoin tokens, the Ethereum network moves ether tokens. Ether works differently

    Ether, denoted by the ticker symbol ETH, can be used similarly. To understand

    it can pay to run programs on Ethereum’s network. These programs can move ether

    at first—an equity coin, for example—creates worlds of complexity when rendered

    they are not based on any hack-proof technology but rather rely on powerful financial
    incentives and disincentives to keep malefactors at bay.These are attractive value
    propositions that every engineer and software designer should be excited about.
    But bootstrapping currency (or scrip) coins is an altogether separate, added challenge
    to getting people excited about end-user applications. This book addresses both
    halves of the challenge.And although the most obvious applications of this software
    might be found in financial services, future applications may also use the same
    levers—trust, transactions, money, and scripting—for entirely other purposes.

    semi-autonomously moving value and enforcing payment agreements between parties.Smart
    contracts are often equated to software applications, but this a reductive analogy;
    they’re more like the concept of classes in conventional object-oriented programming.
    When developers speak of “writing smart contracts,” they are typically referring
    to the practice of writing code in the Solidity language to be executed on the
    Ethereum network. When the code is executed, units of value may be transferred
    as easily as data. As stated in this chapter already, the promise of digital money
    is immense. But how does it work, exactly? How can data act like money in a decentralized

    in a particular structure or format. Often this data has associated instructions
    called methods indicating how the object can be used or accessed. Now let’s imagine
    the information held in this object is valuable to someone, and this person would
    be willing to pay to trigger a method which displays it.In the example below,
    let’s imagine a user wants to pay a small fee to use a cake recipe he or she discovered
    online. This recipe is the data object in our example. At the most literal level,
    the characteristics of the cake object, called attributes, are stored along with
    the methods at a certain address in the computer’s memory.The object below represents
    the attributes of a cake, and contains a method whereby the computer can display
    instructions for how to combine these ingredients to make the cake. Storing the
    information in this way makes it easy for the program and the programmer to swap
    in and out the attributes without needing to change the code for the display instructions.
    In other words, objects are modular chunks of information which can be combined
    and recombined to suit. This will be important to remember in later chapters when
    we discuss the anatomy of the blocks that comprise the blockchain. In JavaScript,
    you can write a cake object as follows:var cake = {firstIngredient: "milk",secondIngredient:

    and functionality to even simple computer programs, without the need for third-party
    libraries or advanced programming know-how.Imagine for a moment that the mixingInstructions
    function cost a few cents in ether to execute. After the price of the cake recipe
    is deducted from the user’s Ethereum wallet balance—which takes a few seconds,
    on average—your smart contract would call the mixingInstructions method and show
    the user how to make the cake. All this can be done without authentication, payment
    APIs, accounts, credit cards, extensive web forms, and all the typical work that
    comes with building an e-commerce application. In fact, all your JavaScript application
    needs to interact with the global public Ethereum chain is that software library
    mentioned earlier, Web3.js.

    the Ethereum network works is the subject of the next chapter, but in the spirit
    of addressing nagging questions first, here’s a quick run-down of how transactions
    are recorded in Ethereum: it’s all stored on every node of the network.All transactions
    in Ethereum are stored on the blockchain, a canonical history of state changes
    stored on every single Ethereum node.When you pay for computing time on the Ethereum
    network, this includes the cost of running the transaction and for storage of
    the data included in your smart contract. (If your contract gets smaller after
    executing, you’ll get a partial refund in the form of a reduced transaction fee.)As
    soon as you execute your smart contract and the fees are paid from your ether
    balance, that data will then be included in the next block. Because the Ethereum
    network requires all nodes to keep a full state database of all contracts, any
    node can query the database locally. If this sounds unscalable, you are paying
    good attention. Ethereum versions 1.5 and 2.0 define a roadmap that addresses
    this scalability issue.We’ll get deeper into how the Ethereum blockchain works

    factors that gives ether, as a cryptocommodity, its intrinsic value—that is, someone
    paid real money to their electricity company to run their mining machine. Specialized
    mining rigs, which use arrays of graphics cards to increase their odds of completing
    a block and getting paid, can run up electricity bills anywhere from $100 to $300
    a month per machine, depending on rates in your area.Mining is fundamental to
    both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and in principle works similarly in both networks,
    with a few caveats. Ethereum has revised the paradigm here too, especially around
    the issuance of ether. How exactly this works is the subject of Chapter [5](A433414_1_En_5_Chapter.html).

    Ethereum development community.As you’ll discover by the end of this book, private
    chains are generally a terrible way to do things for a startup product or service,
    but that hasn’t stopped some companies from trying to launch one. Instead of reinventing
    the wheel, a better idea for entrepreneurs is to build on top of the public Ethereum
    chain.As you’ll see, the public chain has a lot of computing power dedicated to
    its security, making it fairly turn-key for small companies to launch large-scale
    secure web services. However, the public Ethereum blockchain today is entirely
    public, and some corporations may choose to keep their sensitive transactions
    on a private chain, which has some bridge to the public chain. In an enterprise
    software context, where corporate stakeholders are given certain rights and privileges
    to read and write to the company chain, the deployment is known as a permissioned
    blockchain. For permissioned blockchains, wallet addresses are typically issued
    by a trusted third-party who verifies your permission to enter the system, just
    the way an office building’s security pass allows you to transact inside the building.
    By the same metaphor, the public chain would be considered a city park or other
    common space.The positive correlation between a blockchain’s scale and its trustworthiness
