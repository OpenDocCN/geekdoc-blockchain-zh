    control freaks. They need to own the complete end-to-end cycle of everything.
    This is why they are reluctant to outsource, and build their own data centres

    That is why half of banks’ costs are wrapped up in legacy, as customers want branches
    to stay, to keep using cheque books, to have access to tellers and more. This
    is why banks never close down old things, but just add new to the old. That is
    also where incumbent banks have the advantage, in that they have customers. Many

    the UK has separated payments from banking. It is creating a new regulator—the

    Stores and act as Value Systems Integrators. They may or may not be banks, but
    there will be big, new firms that act as our trusted value stores. Banks have
    historically controlled the value chain of finance from deposits to credit. Because
    of this, banks have become control freaks, believing they have to build and manage

    TransferWise and Circle as *alternative finance;* and yet, when you talk with
    these start-ups, they refer to themselves as *narrow finance.* The target of all
    new start-ups is to take just one piece of banking and do it better than a bank,
    based upon today’s technologies. I would argue that most banks will fail at competing
    with this model, as banks try to be all things to all people, rather than one,
    good thing for some people.

    identify where the bank is failing to live up to customer and competitive expectations.

    their value store and exchange, but buys and partners with a hundred different
    companies to deliver those stores and exchanges, rather than developing them all
    themselves. A Value Systems Integrator is a bit like a systems integrator such
    as IBM, Accenture or SAP. Do IBM, Accenture and SAP do all of the things their
