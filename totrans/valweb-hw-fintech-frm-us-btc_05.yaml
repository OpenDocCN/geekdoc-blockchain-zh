    Apple Pay、PayPal、Moven、Simple 等）。
- en: This is why there were two items I recently spotted that show this frustration
    between old and new. The first was research that found European banks spent £40
    billion on IT in 2014, but only £7 billion of that investment went into new systems
    (17.5 percent); the remaining £33 billion (82.5 percent) was spent patching and
    maintaining legacy systems. It is that legacy that frustrates but must be migrated,
    and it’s not just legacy systems, but legacy everything.

  zh: 这就是我最近发现的两个显示出新旧矛盾的项目。第一个是一项研究发现，2014年欧洲银行在IT上花费了400亿英镑，但其中只有70亿英镑投入新系统（17.5%）；其余的330亿英镑（82.5%）花在了修补和维护遗留系统上。正是这个遗留系统令人沮丧，但必须被迁移，而且不仅仅是遗留系统，还有遗留的一切。
- en: The second item was a slide presented by Anthony Thomson (co-founder of Metro
    Bank and Atom Bank) shown at a recent conference. The slide showed that *half*
    of banks’ operational costs are wrapped up in legacy. Legacy buildings, legacy
    processes, legacy systems and some legacy people, too. It’s that legacy that bank
    CEOs and boards are all aware of, but it cannot be exterminated overnight. It
    has to be migrated.

- en: The answer to that question is *yes*, because banks also have legacy customers.
    That is why half of banks’ costs are wrapped up in legacy, as customers want branches
    to stay, to keep using cheque books, to have access to tellers and more. This
    is why banks never close down old things, but just add new to the old. That is
    also where incumbent banks have the advantage, in that they have customers. Many
    have millions of customers, and customers are unlikely to change easily.

  zh: 对于这个问题的答案是*肯定*的，因为银行也有老客户。这就是为什么一半的银行成本被困在传统业务中，因为客户希望分行保留下来，继续使用支票簿，拥有与出纳员接触等等。这就是为什么银行从不关闭旧事物，而只是在旧事物上添加新事物。这也是现有银行具有优势的地方，因为它们有客户。许多银行有数百万客户，而客户不太可能轻易改变。

    Bank. Deutsche Bank has taken all of the components of corporate financing—supply
    chain management, account receivables, foreign exchange, cash management, etc—and
    broken them into over 150 component pieces deployed in the Deutsche Bank Autobahn
    app store. The Autobahn app offers many sub-apps that can be tailored to the needs
    of the corporate client as they see fit. These pieces are all apps that make the
    process of finance easy to track, trace and manage. Corporate clients can then
    go to their Autobahn store and assemble their own pieces of treasury operations
    management into the dashboard of tools that best suit their business. In this

    offered at the back end by their financial partner.

- en: The Value Systems Integrator is where a bank leverages technologies to deliver
    the total end-to-end value chain for their clients, but through partnerships and
    integration rather than internal developments and management. A Value Systems
    Integrator knows that their customer needs a hundred different things to manage
    their value store and exchange, but buys and partners with a hundred different
    companies to deliver those stores and exchanges, rather than developing them all
    themselves. A Value Systems Integrator is a bit like a systems integrator such
    as IBM, Accenture or SAP. Do IBM, Accenture and SAP do all of the things their
    clients need themselves? No way. Instead, they partner, acquire and integrate
    to deliver.
