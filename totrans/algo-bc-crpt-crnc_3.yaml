- en: Throughout this book we have argued that the combination of algorithms, blockchain
    and cryptocurrency (ABC) has the potential to fundamentally and wholly change
    the world of work. Indeed, we argue that our very understanding of the terms work
    and workplace will be structurally altered by the combinational impact of these
    technologies and that drawing parallels with the economic, social and political
    shifts of the Industrial Revolution is both appropriate and necessary for our
    understanding of the effect of these new technologies. We see a future where work
    is increasingly specialised into its fundamental components or microtasks, where
    online working, smart contracts and automation (and further mechanisation) have
    all but eliminated geographic constraints on work, and corporate cryptocurrencies
    and central bank digital currencies facilitate a secure but pseudo self-employed
    global workforce or indeed a global workbank. However, as Frey (2019) convincingly
    argues, one does not question subsequent generations benefit from the Industrial
    Revolution albeit in terms of economic growth and living standards, the environmental
    damage of the subsequent generations living standards, may well prove catastrophic
    for the next. Yet, Frey notes that the workers transitioning into the Industrial
    Revolution mode of work and workers within the first stages of the Industrial
    Revolution were significantly worse off than their predecessors, in terms of overall
    income, conditions and general living. These workers, in effect, were sacrificed
    on the alter of progress, and part of this book must look at and recommend a course
    to attempt to prevent the worker of today (and tomorrow) suffering a similar fate
    for longer term economic progress. It must have been a benevolent weaver indeed
    who opted for a 75% reduction in income, a working pattern which all but eliminated
    their leisure and the accompanying lower life expectancy, greater prevalence of
    disease and all other aspects of Blake’s Dark Satanic Mills, as a necessary cost
    for their unknown future generations’ prosperity. We must not ask today’s workers
    to make the same sacrifice.

  zh: 在本书中，我们主张算法、区块链和加密货币（ABC）的结合有可能从根本上和完全改变工作世界。事实上，我们认为我们对工作和工作场所的理解将会受到这些技术的组合影响而发生结构性改变，并且将与工业革命的经济、社会和政治变革进行类比是恰当且必要的，以便我们更好地理解这些新技术的影响。我们预见到一个未来，在这个未来中，工作将越来越专业化到其基本组成部分或微任务，网络工作、智能合约和自动化（以及进一步的机械化）几乎消除了工作的地理限制，企业加密货币和中央银行数字货币促进了一个安全但伪自由职业的全球劳动力市场，甚至是一个全球工作银行。然而，正如Frey（2019年）有力地论证的那样，尽管工业革命对后续几代人的经济增长和生活水平带来了好处，但随后几代人的环境破坏可能会对下一代造成灾难性的影响。然而，Frey指出，工业革命模式下转型的工人以及工业革命的早期阶段的工人在总收入、工作条件和一般生活水平等方面都明显不如他们的前辈。实际上，这些工人在进步的祭坛上被牺牲了，并且本书的一部分必须考虑并推荐一条路线，试图防止当今（和明天的）工人为长期的经济进步而遭受类似命运。一个善良的织工确实会选择减少75%的收入，一个几乎消除了他们的闲暇时间并伴随着较低的预期寿命、更高的疾病患病率以及其他一切有关布莱克《黑暗撒旦工厂》的方方面面，作为对他们未来世代繁荣的必要代价。我们不应该要求今天的工人做出同样的牺牲。

- en: In this book, we note the impacts on the world of work and the society in which
    we live of technological advancement, we note how the First Industrial Revolution
    wholly transformed the concept of work, and potentially more foundational ones
    such as time and money, progressing through history, we pinpointed a few key events
    and innovations, such as telegraph connectivity, beginnings of digitisation, the
    launch of the smart phone and so on. However, the changes that the worker now
    faces are unique in their pace. Earlier, with relation to cryptocurrency we noted
    how the evolution of money is now an online phenomenon with currency and whole
    financial infrastructures being developed, launched and incorporated in months
    and weeks, rather than decades, as previously happened. We would challenge workers
    to consider their own organisations and recount the technological changes, positive
    and negative, even over the last few years. It is highly likely if you work in
    a large organisation that over the last few years, you have seen whole functions
    hollowed out and replaced, reorganised or removed. It is highly likely that your
    human resources department, payroll and other back office functions have fewer
    staff and more online connectivity and services. You may well have noticed that
    organisational structures are becoming flatter around you, as middle managers
    may be being reutilised elsewhere. If you are at the point of sale, you will have
    undoubtedly noticed the huge lessening of cash you process and the way in which
    people pay will have changed. You may notice that sales cluster around the £30
    point to allow for contactless payment, you may notice in retail that if you are
    in a store with a large online presence part of your role has been redesigned
    to process returns. You could see targets shifting towards collation of consumer
    data, and perhaps wonder why you have to give the option of an email receipt or
    attempt to collect the customers email address through competitions, after sales
    services or so on. You will have noticed the shift to online options of your products
    and potentially even a movement away from physical space. Retail units are shrinking,
    backs of stores more so. As stick holdings are reduced, it is expected that sales
    will be made online. Considering your retail space, you may note that experiential
    shopping is becoming much more commonplace and that your department store, now
    alongside clothing concessions, has coffee shops, fine dining and in at least
    one notable example a luxury car showroom, in the space where recently it sold
    children’s clothes. Your customers are now part of the online ecosystem and are
    able to constantly feedback and comment. Even now, our world of work has changed
    considerably in the last half decade, and generally below this large-scale noticeable
    change there is a myriad of small scale, but just as impactful, change, impactful
    on the organisation, customer and the worker. The view and opinion of an organisation
    by its workers may now be extremely fluid; previous differences in view between
    different grades and roles exist, but are amplified by groups doing the same role,
    with the longer term staff permanent and the newer staff on temporary or fixed
    term contracts. Even for permanent staff, older contracts may have better clauses
    and conditions attached (where legal), older (better) pension schemes may be closed
    to new staff, older staff may have benefited from considerably more training and
    development, benefits and ‘perks’.

  zh: 在这本书中，我们注意到技术进步对我们所生活的工作世界和社会的影响，我们注意到第一次工业革命彻底改变了工作的概念，以及可能更基础的概念，比如时间和金钱，在历史上的进程中，我们指出了一些关键事件和创新，比如电报连接性，数字化的开始，智能手机的推出等等。然而，工人现在面临的变化在其速度上是独特的。早些时候，关于加密货币，我们注意到货币的演变现在是一种在线现象，货币和整个金融基础设施是在几个月甚至几周内开发、推出和纳入的，而不是几十年前的情况。我们将挑战工人们考虑他们自己的组织，并重新叙述过去几年内的技术变化，无论是积极的还是消极的。如果你在一个大型组织工作，那么在过去的几年里，你很有可能看到整个职能部门被掏空和替换、重新组织或删除。你很可能会注意到你的人力资源部、工资单和其他后勤职能的员工更少，而且在线连接和服务更多。你可能已经注意到你周围的组织结构变得越来越扁平，因为中层管理者可能被重新利用到其他地方。如果你在销售点，你肯定会注意到你处理的现金大大减少，以及人们支付的方式已经改变。你可能会注意到销售额围绕着£30这一点聚集，以便进行无接触支付，你可能会注意到在零售行业，如果你在一个拥有大量在线存在的商店，你的角色的一部分已经被重新设计成处理退货。你可能会看到销售目标转向消费者数据的整理，并且可能会想知道为什么你必须提供电子收据选项或者试图通过竞赛、售后服务等方式收集客户的电子邮件地址。你会注意到产品的在线选项的转变，甚至可能会从实体空间中移开。零售单元正在缩小，后面的存货更是如此。随着存货的减少，预计销售将在网上进行。考虑到你的零售空间，你可能会注意到体验式购物变得越来越普遍，你的百货商店，现在除了服装特许经营，还有咖啡店、精致餐厅，至少有一个显着的例子是一个豪华汽车展厅，最近在卖儿童服装的地方。你的客户现在是在线生态系统的一部分，能够不断地反馈和评论。即使在现在，我们的工作世界在过去的半个世纪发生了相当大的变化，而在这种大规模可见的变化之下，有着无数小规模的变化，但同样具有影响力，对组织、客户和工人都具有影响力。一个组织由其工人的观点和看法现在可能非常流动；以前不同等级和角色之间的观点差异存在，但是由于做同样工作的群体存在，这种差异被放大了，长期工作人员是永久性的，而新员工则是临时性或固定期限的合同。即使对于永久性员工，老合同可能会附有更好的条款和条件（在法律允许的情况下），更老（更好）的养老金计划可能会对新员工关闭，老员工可能会受益于更多的培训和发展、福利和“福利”。

    the technology it adopts and that this causes often significant issues, with regard
    to a particular innovation. However, we can explore this idea with regard to the
    ABC economy we propose, and note that several foundational relationships between
    the worker and work may not survive. The idea of a career or job for life may
    be waning, but it is still often seen as aspirational. How will society function
    if the possibility of this is totally remote? The ideas of a single employer,
    a single skill set or of even knowing who you are working for may also fade. Work
    and society will change rapidly, quicker than ever before, and yet we are still
    relying on our very human society to keep up. To reiterate a key theme of this
    book, the state must provide the safety net, both financial and psychological,
    for the individual. Our human ability to cope with such change may be limited,
    and various behavioural biases and heuristics may make this more difficult. If
    we examine the sections above, a worker in an organisation, recognising the change,
    particularly of a flattened hierarchy may be consciously aware of this, but still
    convinced that they will be able to be promoted. If this social contract breaks
    down, and progression continues to be a removed option for many workers, then
    the consequences could be considerable and manifest in a variety of forms.

- en: So then, what could go wrong? The obvious lesson from the previous Industrial
    Revolution(s) is simple. Longer term the subsequent generation of workers may
    benefit, in the short term, the current workforce will generally lose pay, conditions,
    rights and satisfaction. Furthermore, workers displaced by new technologies or
    approaches will often never return back to the pay and conditions that they had
    previously. Crucially, a whole generation of workers may be ‘in between’, they
    may begin careers, train and invest in them and see their expected world of work
    disappear around them. This disappearance may well be subtle to start with. Their
    expected progression routes may disappear, wages may not keep up with inflation,
    training and upskilling options could no longer be available. Then, *en masse*
    we could see hiring freezes and redundancies, here we would see recession-type
    behaviours from employers and organisations, without the accompanying drops in
    economic activity. This economic paradox could continue, wholly displacing a generation
    of workers as the skills required by the new world of work are at best limited
    in this transitional generation. Even notions of transferrable skills provided
    through schooling, further and higher education are unlikely to suffice, as fundamentally
    the worker, or expectant worker, has devoted much of their skill set to a single,
    or at best a few, competencies. It is not just the skill deficit (or more accurately
    misalignment), but the approach, philosophy and behaviours of the transitional
    generation which will hamper their working in the new world of work. The stickiness
    in approach of our schooling and training institutions at an institutional and
    organisational level may well further exacerbate this as these institutions may,
    without state support and direction, continue to provide a traditional skill set.
    Indeed, it is all too easy to imagine a state education regulator hampering efforts
    of individual institutions to adapt and update their curricula to this end, the
    skills that may well be needed in this future of work are untried and untested,
    it is a courageous (or possibly reckless) body which embraces their teaching until
    the need is inarguably clear.

  zh: 那么，问题出在哪里呢？从之前的工业革命中可以得出一个明显的教训。长期来看，后续一代工人可能会受益，但在短期内，当前的劳动力通常会失去工资、条件、权利和满足感。此外，被新技术或方法所取代的工人往往永远也无法恢复到他们之前的工资和条件。关键是，整整一代工人可能会处于“中间状态”，他们可能开始职业生涯，接受培训并投资于其中，但看到他们预期的工作世界在他们周围消失。这种消失可能一开始是微妙的。他们预期的职业发展路径可能消失，工资可能无法跟上通货膨胀，培训和提升技能的选择可能不再可用。然后，*大规模*地，我们可能会看到招聘冻结和裁员，这里我们会看到雇主和组织出现了衰退型行为，但没有伴随着经济活动的下降。这种经济悖论可能会继续下去，完全淘汰一代工人，因为新的工作世界所需的技能在这个过渡时期的一代人中至多是有限的。即使是通过学校、进一步和更高教育提供的可转移技能的概念，也不太可能足够，因为基本上工人或期待的工人已经将他们的技能集中在单一或最多几个能力上。不仅是技能赤字（或更准确地说是错位），还有过渡时期一代人的方法、理念和行为将妨碍他们在新的工作世界中工作。我们学校和培训机构在制度和组织层面的方法的固执可能会进一步加剧这一情况，因为这些机构可能会在没有国家支持和指导的情况下继续提供传统的技能。事实上，很容易想象到国家教育监管机构阻碍个体机构调整和更新其课程的努力，直到在无可争议的情况下需要的技能是需要勇气（或可能是鲁莽）的机构。
- en: However, as we see it, the key danger of the new world of work we see as a potential
    outcome of the convergence of ABC, is that it can facilitate a complete global
    race to the bottom in terms of worker pay and conditions. Algorithms can reduce
    the skill required to complete an output or process by fundamental reduction of
    said output or process to a series of lower skilled tasks. Blockchain smart contracts
    and a reduction in physicality of work and geographic constraints can coordinate
    a system of underbidding for any particular task until the wage reaches the lowest
    subsistence price for labour. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies can both reduce options
    for the worker if a particular firm will only pay for a task in their own corporate
    cryptocurrency and potentially make state involvement in the monetary process
    harder. In this view of the ABC economy, then, wages and conditions have been
    competed down to subsistence levels only and the state is less able to provide
    worker protections or welfare due to their being edged out of the monetary process.
    A bleak future indeed, and closer to many of the dystopian pictures painted in
    science fiction books and films. Unfortunately, given our understanding of history,
    this is also far too believable.

  zh: 然而，据我们所见，我们认为ABC融合可能产生的新工作世界的关键危险是，它可以促成工人工资和条件的全球性竞争到底。算法可以通过将所述产出或过程根本降低为一系列较低技能任务来降低完成产出或过程所需的技能。区块链智能合约和工作的物理性和地理限制的降低可以协调一种对于任何特定任务进行竞价的系统，直到工资降至劳动力最低生存价格。此外，加密货币既可以减少工人的选择，如果特定公司只支付其自己公司的加密货币，也可能使国家参与货币进程变得更加困难。在ABC经济的这种观点中，工资和条件已经竞争到了仅能维持生存的水平，国家也因为被排挤出货币进程而无法提供工人保护或福利。这确实是一个暗淡的未来，更接近于许多科幻书籍和电影中描绘的反乌托邦图景。不幸的是，鉴于我们对历史的理解，这也太过可信。

    years ago, the potential for this bleak future was based around a relatively simple
    global analysis. Ultimately, a state or head of state would see a benefit from
    this degradation of pay and conditions. It may be for political ideology, a response
    to (or a threat to) the global order or simply as we have seen many times before,
    an attempt to lure global corporations or foreign investment. In any traditional
    analysis, this would spark a race to the bottom, not dissimilar to the rush to
    cut corporation taxes to attract business, where, once price (wage) competition
    is the norm, undercutting to win business, to a stage where no one can further
    undercut is the likely outcome. This however was in a stage of global order where
    national governments were acting in concert to approach (however unsatisfactorily)
    the pressing global challenges and emergencies. Here, we imagined the coordination
    of global powers, presenting a united front against the challenges of the ABC
    economy and the issues arrived around lone states refusing to participate and
    threating this approach. However, even through the writing of this book, that
    is becoming far harder to envisage. Deregulation and wage reduction, in this technological
    market place, in essence, at the whim of a political statement and accomplished
    at the increasing pace of the ABC economy, could easily ‘bring jobs back’, but

    of decentralisation and a removal of government from the economic process, we
    advocate a strong role for government, regulation and policy action. Much of the
    initial allure of cryptocurrencies was based around the removal of government
    from the monetary process, blockchain removes intermediaries and automation may
    remove worker protections. This wholesale removal of external bodies can in essence
    be twinned with the potential for wholesale removal of any worker rights, protections
    and surplus from the work process. Indeed, it is all too easy imagine a world
    where automation and algorithmising creates a world of work solely based on the
    necessary base process for each output, a de facto world of entirely unskilled
    work and where the lack of geographic constraints simply increases competition
    for each ‘bit’ of work to where (charitably) the price for that work falls simply
    to subsistence levels. In this world, smart contracts and instantaneous infinitely
    divisible payments combine to create a global work bank, who are in effect on
    zero-hour subsistence wage contracts. We could even go further, with the ability
    for algorithms to learn and adapt, the simple act of completing a piece of ‘bit’
    work would generate more data on that process eventually leading to, via the ‘data
    exploitation’ of the Bitworker to a further reduction in the price for that piece
    of work due to efficiencies generated through the use of that additional data
    point. Unionisation would be next to impossible in its traditional form. Geographic
    freedoms and mass over supply of labour could create a race to the bottom and
    even international ‘competition’ based on diminishing worker protections and rights.

  zh: 总的来说，与最初的加密货币的整体哲学相反，即去中心化和从经济过程中消除政府的作用，我们主张政府、监管和政策行动发挥重要作用。最初加密货币的吸引力很大程度上是基于将政府从货币流通过程中排除在外，区块链消除了中间人，自动化可能会削弱工人的保护措施。这种对外部机构的全面排斥本质上可以与全面剥夺任何工人权利、保护措施和工作过程中的剩余价值相对应。事实上，很容易想象到一个世界，自动化和算法化创造了一个仅基于每个输出的必要基本过程的工作世界，实际上是一个完全没有技能的工作世界，而且地理限制的缺乏只会增加对每个工作单位的竞争，从而（慈善地说）工作的价格仅降至维持生计的水平。在这个世界里，智能合约和即时的无限分割支付相结合，创建了一个全球工作银行，实际上是零工制度下的维持生计工资合同。我们甚至可以进一步说，由于算法具有学习和适应的能力，完成一项“位”工作的简单行为将产生更多关于该过程的数据，最终通过“位工人”的“数据利用”导致该工作片段的价格进一步降低，因为通过使用该附加数据点生成的效率。工会化在其传统形式下几乎是不可能的。地理自由和劳动力的大量供应可能会导致竞争降至最低点，甚至基于不断减少的工人保护措施和权利的国际“竞争”。
- en: Ironically, part of the solution to this may lie in the development of corporate
    cryptocurrencies such as Libra. Notwithstanding the debates around the corporate
    incursion into what in effect is traditionally only the province of sovereign
    governments and nation states, the issuance of money and the generation of seigniorage,
    Libra and the Libra Council are known entities. In effect, they give this currency
    a face, an entity and governments a port of call. Libra has a defined working
    structure, a platform of operation and a series of whitepapers dictating its processes.
    For the first time, a mass cryptocurrency will have a structure regulatory bodies
    that can understand and incorporate into their functions. Libra has killed the
    initial crypto promise of decentralisation and all of its inherent dangers for
    governments, by in effect becoming just another currency. If we simply imagine
    the Libra Council as just another currency board, Libra in effect becomes mundane,
    and mundane becomes safe. Libra can be incorporated relatively easily into a nation
    states taxation regime and fiscal and monetary policies. The UK’s National Insurance
    System should be able to, in effect handle an income or a portion of it in Libra
    as easily as it can handle a UK national who receives part of their income in
    Euros or Dollars. Corporate cryptocurrencies remove the decentralisation and thus
    danger of cryptocurrencies for the nation state and ironically may be vital for
    the prevention of the wholesale McDonaldisation of work. States must carefully
    choose between a powerful, but more limited in effect, challenge to their monetary
    dominance (corporate cryptocurrencies) and a weaker but potentially far more disruptive
    challenge (true decentralised cryptocurrencies). An unenviable decision, but one
    that will need to be made in the near future. Which way this goes could have significant
    implications for the world of work as well as the future of fiscal and monetary
    policy.

    is possible, then the structures, organisations and safety nets of today are redundant.
    Throughout this book, we have noted that there is a bright potential future, which
    can only be realised if accompanied by farsighted, long-term and proactive policy.
    First and foremost, governments must acknowledge that the transition to this new
    way of working is more akin to rapid deindustrialisation rather than gradual technological
    change. Policy to protect the worker must be key, as must learning from failed
    policy in the past. In order to maintain prosperity and not increase (dare we
    dream to decrease) inequality, displaced workers must not lose out further. The
    displacement of the middle income worker must not be to lower wages and worse
    conditions. Graduates must not enter a transitioning labour market where their
    skills evaporate but their debt remains, and precarity must be addressed rather
    than become the norm. Mass training and technological upskilling must be a priority
    for any government, this training must be proactive and not a response to unemployment
    when the worker has already lost out, but training to allow a worker to evolve
    and adapt to their benefit within the new economy.

  zh: ABC 经济的潜在结果，在我们看来，是完全变革的，我们之前讨论的想法，即如果今天的工人被转移到我们提出的工作世界中，会发现很少熟悉的情况，应该让政策停下来思考。如果这个新的工作世界像我们相信的那样完全不同，那么今天的结构、组织和安全网就是多余的。在本书中，我们已经指出，只有在伴随着有远见、长期和积极的政策时，才能实现光明的潜在未来。首先，政府必须承认，转向这种新的工作方式更类似于快速去工业化，而不是渐进的技术变革。保护工人的政策必须是关键，过去失败的政策也必须从中吸取教训。为了维护繁荣，而不是增加（我们敢梦想减少）不平等，被解雇的工人不能进一步受到损失。中等收入工人的流失不能导致工资降低和条件恶化。毕业生不能进入一个正在转型的劳动力市场，他们的技能消失了，但他们的债务依然存在，而且必须解决不稳定而不是让它成为常态。大规模培训和技术提升必须成为任何政府的优先事项，这种培训必须是积极主动的，而不是在工人已经受到失业打击时才作出的回应，而是培训使工人能够在新经济中进化和适应以使其受益。
- en: Additionally, clear and serious thought needs to be given to wider fiscal and
    monetary policy within this new world. In terms of personal taxation, one instinctively
    feels that the corporate cryptocurrencies (stablecoins) will pose less of a headache
    for governments than a myriad of transferrable and opaque tokens. However, this
    is only with regard to personal taxation, the transfer of monetary power from
    state to corporation may have a number of further issues for the global economy
    and may simply maintain the ability to tax the worker, but further increase the
    distance between the state’s claims and the corporations willingness to pay. However,
    if indeed we journey to a world of heavily increased platform working, then considerations
    to the usual duties of the employer need to be made. In order to maintain conditions
    for the worker, the provision of pensions, insurance, holiday pay and so on must
    be maintained. In particular, we would recommend that pension contributions and
    crucially employer contributions are incorporated into any smart contract, with
    similar protections against opting out and incentives to save. It is a simple
    stretch of the imagination to consider that with smart contracts a worker can
    generate and maintain their own ‘welfare and insurance’ portfolio. However, the
    state must ensure that this is not simply a race to the bottom or a further widener
    of inequality by regulating a fair minimum where employers pay their share. Ultimately,
    the cost saving to the employer from their labour supply being platform based,
    must not simply (as history tells us is all too easy) be incorporated into short-term
    profitability, but be used to create long-term sustainable conditions for the
    Bitworker.

- en: Learners of today must consider the large-scale commoditisation of presently
    full and part-skilled professions when choosing their future careers. As previously
    discussed, it does not automatically follow that this will mean poorer pay and
    conditions. These detrimental impacts from the perspective of the worker tend
    only to be coupled with advancements in automations where tasks can largely be
    coded and thereby may replace human endeavour. However, where this is not the
    case, our ABCs can deliver more security over future income streams by forward
    selling Bitworker time. Students must therefore trade-off their career preferences
    against required future flexibility. However, what is clear is that there are
    little-to-no areas of work activity which this all-pervasive technology will not
    impact. Therefore, rather than seeking to run from such advancements, the best
    and continued advice would always be to study and aim to do what you are passionate
    about doing. Such passions are unlikely to feature the occupations outlined by
    Frey (2017) as being at risk from automation, for example, Data Entry Keyers,
    Library Technicians and New Accounts Clerks, etc. Instead, we would encourage
    students to aspire to more creative and higher order work activities such as artists,
    therapists, directors and consultants. A world with fewer rote accountants but
    more creativity (not creative accounting!), is likely to be one which delivers
    more worker satisfaction but whether this can deliver the required aggregate employment
    numbers to sustain an economy remains to be seen. In summary, work hard, follow
    what inspires you and ask yourself the your choice of profession could be automated
    to some extent. If ‘yes’, then be careful in your choice of vocation.

  zh: 如今的学习者在选择未来的职业时必须考虑当前各种专业的大规模商品化。正如先前讨论的那样，这并不意味着薪酬和条件就会变得更差。从工人的角度来看，这些不利影响通常只与自动化的进步相结合，其中任务很大程度上可以编码化，因此可能取代人类的努力。然而，如果情况不是这样，我们的
    ABC 可以通过提前出售比特工时来提供对未来收入流的更多安全性。因此，学生必须权衡他们的职业偏好与未来所需的灵活性。然而，明确的是，这种无所不在的技术几乎没有不会受到影响的工作领域。因此，与其试图逃避这样的进步，最好和持续的建议总是去学习并努力做自己热衷于做的事情。这样的激情不太可能体现在弗雷（2017年）所概述的可能受到自动化威胁的职业中，例如，数据录入员，图书管理员和新帐户文员等。相反，我们鼓励学生向更具创造性和更高级别的工作活动发展，例如艺术家，治疗师，导演和顾问。一个拥有更少机械化会计师但更多创造性（不是创造性会计！）的世界，可能会提供更多的工人满足感，但是否能提供所需的总就业人数以维持经济仍有待观察。总之，努力工作，追随激励你的事物，并问问自己你选择的职业在某种程度上是否可以自动化。如果是“是”，那么在选择职业时要小心。

    will be mitigated. Possible solutions include a career switch, upskilling in your
    present sector, or perhaps seeking to gain promotion to managerial or leadership
    roles which may prove to be more resilient to the aforementioned threats. Moreover,
    we would encourage workers to seek a portfolio of income streams where possible

- en: It would be glib to suggest that schools, colleges and universities should place
    an increased emphasis on skill development in areas such as coding and technology,
    etc. Indeed, this is already the case today and many initiatives have been launched
    to foster this desire. One such example is Scratch at [www.scratch.mit.edu](http://www.scratch.mit.edu)
    developed by Harvard Graduate School of Education which provides children with
    a basic programming language where they can build stories, music and animations
    whilst learning the basic structure and rules of a typical coding language. Given
    the nature of the technologies which we have envisioned it is key that teachers
    and lecturers build such learning in to all layers of most educational courses
    similar to that of ethics or sustainability which are often incorporated across
    all units of study given their pervasive importance. The corollary of the above
    would be a focus upon increasingly creative subjects including, but not limited
    to, creative writing, leadership, music and the arts more broadly. However, such
    subjects have typically been squeezed of late attracting increasingly smaller
    allocations of already dwindling pots of funding. Economic pressures often necessitate
    such changes especially given a world which places greater importance, status
    and employment prospects upon Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
    subjects. A balance here is obviously key as there is little advantage in training
    a generation of poets with little regard for how these individuals can find meaningful
    employment post their educational pathways.

  zh: 建议学校、学院和大学应更加注重技能发展，如编码和技术等。事实上，这已经是现实，许多倡议已经启动以促进这种愿望。其中一个例子是哈佛大学教育研究生院开发的[Scratch](http://www.scratch.mit.edu)，它为孩子们提供了一个基本的编程语言，在这里他们可以制作故事、音乐和动画，同时学习典型编码语言的基本结构和规则。鉴于我们设想的技术的性质，教师和讲师将此类学习纳入到大多数教育课程的各个层面是至关重要的，类似于伦理或可持续性，这些因其普遍重要性通常在所有学习单元中都有涉及。上述的推论是要更加关注日益创新的科目，包括但不限于创意写作、领导力、音乐和更广泛的艺术。然而，这些科目近来通常受到挤压，吸引了越来越少的已经稀缺的资金。经济压力常常需要这种变化，特别是在一个世界中，这个世界更加重视、地位更高并且就业前景更好的是科学、技术、工程和数学（STEM）科目。在这里平衡显然是关键的，因为培养一代对如何找到有意义的就业不太关心的诗人并没有什么好处。
- en: Small business owners above all stakeholder groups stand to gain perhaps most
    from the technological advancements which we have critically discussed above.
    Smart contracts will deliver greater confidence in cash flow management ensuring
    payment is obtained in good time and thereby helping business to plan with confidence
    and grow accordingly. Furthermore, the increasing commoditisation and availability
    of flexible working will allow Small to Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to more
    easily flex their employment resources in line with their business needs. This
    helps to keep operational gearing at relatively lower levels which in turn reduces
    risk for the owner manager. In contrast to the above advantages, the ABCs of our
    triumvirate are likely to disrupt and shorten many supply chains which may negate

  zh: 最终思考
- en: 'In *Algorithms, Blockchain & Cryptocurrency: Implications for the Future of
    the Workplace*, we have made a series of (hopefully) logical assumptions and suppositions
    based upon ongoing and emerging trends and supertrends both in the study of work
    and in the wider global economy. We must however acknowledge the considerable
    issues of future forecasting. During the writing of this book, the once inevitable
    march of the corporate cryptocurrency appears to be being (at least temporarily)
    derailed. As discussed in greater detail in the recommendations section, the ‘likely’
    issuance of a global cryptocurrency is a key feature of our proposed ABC economy
    and analysis of its implications for the future of work. We ultimately believe
    that the ‘Genie is out of the bottle’ for these types of currencies and their
    eventual issuance will affect the future of working. Clearly, though, the timings
    are far less clear and dependable than they were in early 2019\. In practice,
    then, for the book and the future as written, we may well see the themes presented
    coming to pass in a very similar timescale. There is a strong possibility that
    Big Tech, a GAFA or a BAT or even an emerging entity, will learn the lessons of
    Libra and utilising a ‘send mover advantage’ successfully launch a global corporate
    cryptocurrency in Libra’s image and maybe with a smoother regulatory ride. It
    appears that elements of the trust in Big Tech which has generally outweighed
    the trust in traditional banking firms post 2008 crisis, is waning. It is this
    trust which also provides a foundation for the movement towards what we have termed
    the ABC economy. The current (October 2019 at the time of writing) increasing
    scrutiny of social media as we move towards democratic events in the UK and USA
    is shaking the trust in these technologies and firms, especially in the demographics
    which are ‘the workers of tomorrow’. Barely a day goes by without further revelations
    around the intrusion, privacy and wellbeing issues arising from social media,
    continual web connection and the overarching issue of technological progression
    outpacing cultural and societal ability to adapt. The stage here is being set
    for increasing societal, and regulatory pressures on the role and infiltration
    of tech in the world of work, and the future revelations revealed by this scrutiny
    may well further shake the trust in ABC, prompting unforeseen adaptions and adoptions
    of technology outside the scope of this book. The notions of trust in society
    are highly relevant here, the reported issues surrounding Cambridge Analytica
    and their dissemination to the wider public, the frequent notifications of missing
    cryptocurrency and its continued association with crime further serve to reduce
    societal trust in these technologies. However, the future we outline relies on
    trust in order to operate, we note that blockchain ‘replaces trust with truth’,
    and if societal trust wanes in Big Tech to such an extent, that the transparent,
    immutable and verifiable properties of blockchain and associated smart contracts
    become the only mechanism facilitating the economy, then we question, if giving
    existing trust dynamics, this will be enough to promote wholesale change in the
    world of work.'

  zh: 在《*算法、区块链和加密货币：对未来工作的影响*》一书中，我们基于正在进行和新兴的工作研究以及更广泛的全球经济的趋势和超级趋势，提出了一系列（希望是）逻辑假设和假设。然而，我们必须承认未来预测存在相当大的问题。在撰写本书期间，一度不可避免的企业加密货币的发展似乎被（至少是暂时地）推迟了。正如在建议部分中更详细地讨论的那样，“可能”发行全球加密货币是我们提出的ABC经济的关键特征，以及对其对未来工作的影响进行分析。我们最终相信，这些类型的货币已经“出笼”，它们的最终发行将影响未来的工作。然而，很显然，时间表比2019年初时更不明确和可靠。因此，在实践中，对于本书和未来的写作，我们很可能会看到所提出的主题以非常类似的时间表成为现实。有很大可能，大型科技公司，像是GAFA或BAT，甚至是新兴实体，将吸取Libra的教训，成功地利用“先发优势”推出一个像Libra一样的全球企业加密货币，也许在监管方面更加顺利。似乎自2008年危机以来，大多数情况下，对大型科技公司的信任超过了对传统银行业的信任，但现在这种信任正在减弱。正是这种信任也为我们所称的ABC经济的发展提供了基础。当前（撰写时为2019年10月）对社交媒体的日益严格审查，随着英国和美国朝着民主事件的发展，正在动摇对这些技术和公司的信任，尤其是对“未来工作者”这一人群的信任。几乎每天都有进一步揭示社交媒体、持续的网络连接以及技术进步超越文化和社会能力去适应所带来的侵入、隐私和健康问题的消息。在这里，社会和监管对科技在工作世界中的角色和渗透程度施加了越来越大的压力，这种审查带来的未来揭示可能会进一步动摇对ABC的信任，促使技术在本书范围之外出现无法预料的调整和采用。社会中对信任的概念在这里非常相关，有关剑桥分析公司及其向更广泛公众传播的问题，频繁通知丢失加密货币以及其与犯罪的持续关联进一步降低了社会对这些技术的信任。然而，我们所概述的未来依赖于信任的运作，我们注意到区块链“用真理取代了信任”，如果社会对大型科技公司的信任下降到这种程度，以至于区块链及其相关智能合约的透明、不可变和可验证属性成为促进经济的唯一机制，那么我们要问，在给定现有的信任动态情况下，这是否足以促成工作世界的全面变革。
