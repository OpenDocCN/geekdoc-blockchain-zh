- en: Throughout this book we have argued that the combination of algorithms, blockchain
    and cryptocurrency (ABC) has the potential to fundamentally and wholly change
    the world of work. Indeed, we argue that our very understanding of the terms work
    and workplace will be structurally altered by the combinational impact of these
    technologies and that drawing parallels with the economic, social and political
    shifts of the Industrial Revolution is both appropriate and necessary for our
    understanding of the effect of these new technologies. We see a future where work
    is increasingly specialised into its fundamental components or microtasks, where
    online working, smart contracts and automation (and further mechanisation) have
    all but eliminated geographic constraints on work, and corporate cryptocurrencies
    and central bank digital currencies facilitate a secure but pseudo self-employed
    global workforce or indeed a global workbank. However, as Frey (2019) convincingly
    argues, one does not question subsequent generations benefit from the Industrial
    Revolution albeit in terms of economic growth and living standards, the environmental
    damage of the subsequent generations living standards, may well prove catastrophic
    for the next. Yet, Frey notes that the workers transitioning into the Industrial
    Revolution mode of work and workers within the first stages of the Industrial
    Revolution were significantly worse off than their predecessors, in terms of overall
    income, conditions and general living. These workers, in effect, were sacrificed
    on the alter of progress, and part of this book must look at and recommend a course
    to attempt to prevent the worker of today (and tomorrow) suffering a similar fate
    for longer term economic progress. It must have been a benevolent weaver indeed
    who opted for a 75% reduction in income, a working pattern which all but eliminated
    their leisure and the accompanying lower life expectancy, greater prevalence of
    disease and all other aspects of Blake’s Dark Satanic Mills, as a necessary cost
    for their unknown future generations’ prosperity. We must not ask today’s workers
    to make the same sacrifice.

    answer.

- en: In this book, we note the impacts on the world of work and the society in which
    we live of technological advancement, we note how the First Industrial Revolution
    wholly transformed the concept of work, and potentially more foundational ones
    such as time and money, progressing through history, we pinpointed a few key events
    and innovations, such as telegraph connectivity, beginnings of digitisation, the
    launch of the smart phone and so on. However, the changes that the worker now
    faces are unique in their pace. Earlier, with relation to cryptocurrency we noted
    how the evolution of money is now an online phenomenon with currency and whole
    financial infrastructures being developed, launched and incorporated in months
    and weeks, rather than decades, as previously happened. We would challenge workers
    to consider their own organisations and recount the technological changes, positive
    and negative, even over the last few years. It is highly likely if you work in
    a large organisation that over the last few years, you have seen whole functions
    hollowed out and replaced, reorganised or removed. It is highly likely that your
    human resources department, payroll and other back office functions have fewer
    staff and more online connectivity and services. You may well have noticed that
    organisational structures are becoming flatter around you, as middle managers
    may be being reutilised elsewhere. If you are at the point of sale, you will have
    undoubtedly noticed the huge lessening of cash you process and the way in which
    people pay will have changed. You may notice that sales cluster around the £30
    point to allow for contactless payment, you may notice in retail that if you are
    in a store with a large online presence part of your role has been redesigned
    to process returns. You could see targets shifting towards collation of consumer
    data, and perhaps wonder why you have to give the option of an email receipt or
    attempt to collect the customers email address through competitions, after sales
    services or so on. You will have noticed the shift to online options of your products
    and potentially even a movement away from physical space. Retail units are shrinking,
    backs of stores more so. As stick holdings are reduced, it is expected that sales
    will be made online. Considering your retail space, you may note that experiential
    shopping is becoming much more commonplace and that your department store, now
    alongside clothing concessions, has coffee shops, fine dining and in at least
    one notable example a luxury car showroom, in the space where recently it sold
    children’s clothes. Your customers are now part of the online ecosystem and are
    able to constantly feedback and comment. Even now, our world of work has changed
    considerably in the last half decade, and generally below this large-scale noticeable
    change there is a myriad of small scale, but just as impactful, change, impactful
    on the organisation, customer and the worker. The view and opinion of an organisation
    by its workers may now be extremely fluid; previous differences in view between
    different grades and roles exist, but are amplified by groups doing the same role,
    with the longer term staff permanent and the newer staff on temporary or fixed
    term contracts. Even for permanent staff, older contracts may have better clauses
    and conditions attached (where legal), older (better) pension schemes may be closed
    to new staff, older staff may have benefited from considerably more training and
    development, benefits and ‘perks’.

    and the individual. We note with concern the increased spending patterns and propensity
    to debt associated with our psychological removal from our idea of money exacerbated
    by our technology. An individual receiving a real-time, personalised advertisement
    accompanied by offers of finance may find it increasingly hard to resist. Imagine
    a future where your perfect dream holiday, exactly tailored to your wants based
    on all your previous holiday searches, comments on your friends’ holiday photographs
    and linked back to key events in your life, comes with a direct preapproved loan

    the technology it adopts and that this causes often significant issues, with regard
    to a particular innovation. However, we can explore this idea with regard to the
    ABC economy we propose, and note that several foundational relationships between
    the worker and work may not survive. The idea of a career or job for life may
    be waning, but it is still often seen as aspirational. How will society function
    if the possibility of this is totally remote? The ideas of a single employer,
    a single skill set or of even knowing who you are working for may also fade. Work
    and society will change rapidly, quicker than ever before, and yet we are still
    relying on our very human society to keep up. To reiterate a key theme of this
    book, the state must provide the safety net, both financial and psychological,
    for the individual. Our human ability to cope with such change may be limited,
    and various behavioural biases and heuristics may make this more difficult. If
    we examine the sections above, a worker in an organisation, recognising the change,
    particularly of a flattened hierarchy may be consciously aware of this, but still
    convinced that they will be able to be promoted. If this social contract breaks
    down, and progression continues to be a removed option for many workers, then
    the consequences could be considerable and manifest in a variety of forms.

    Revolution(s) is simple. Longer term the subsequent generation of workers may
    benefit, in the short term, the current workforce will generally lose pay, conditions,
    rights and satisfaction. Furthermore, workers displaced by new technologies or
    approaches will often never return back to the pay and conditions that they had
    previously. Crucially, a whole generation of workers may be ‘in between’, they
    may begin careers, train and invest in them and see their expected world of work
    disappear around them. This disappearance may well be subtle to start with. Their
    expected progression routes may disappear, wages may not keep up with inflation,
    training and upskilling options could no longer be available. Then, *en masse*
    we could see hiring freezes and redundancies, here we would see recession-type
    behaviours from employers and organisations, without the accompanying drops in
    economic activity. This economic paradox could continue, wholly displacing a generation
    of workers as the skills required by the new world of work are at best limited
    in this transitional generation. Even notions of transferrable skills provided
    through schooling, further and higher education are unlikely to suffice, as fundamentally
    the worker, or expectant worker, has devoted much of their skill set to a single,
    or at best a few, competencies. It is not just the skill deficit (or more accurately
    misalignment), but the approach, philosophy and behaviours of the transitional
    generation which will hamper their working in the new world of work. The stickiness
    in approach of our schooling and training institutions at an institutional and
    organisational level may well further exacerbate this as these institutions may,
    without state support and direction, continue to provide a traditional skill set.
    Indeed, it is all too easy to imagine a state education regulator hampering efforts
    of individual institutions to adapt and update their curricula to this end, the
    skills that may well be needed in this future of work are untried and untested,
    it is a courageous (or possibly reckless) body which embraces their teaching until
    the need is inarguably clear.

- en: However, as we see it, the key danger of the new world of work we see as a potential
    outcome of the convergence of ABC, is that it can facilitate a complete global
    race to the bottom in terms of worker pay and conditions. Algorithms can reduce
    the skill required to complete an output or process by fundamental reduction of
    said output or process to a series of lower skilled tasks. Blockchain smart contracts
    and a reduction in physicality of work and geographic constraints can coordinate
    a system of underbidding for any particular task until the wage reaches the lowest
    subsistence price for labour. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies can both reduce options
    for the worker if a particular firm will only pay for a task in their own corporate
    cryptocurrency and potentially make state involvement in the monetary process
    harder. In this view of the ABC economy, then, wages and conditions have been
    competed down to subsistence levels only and the state is less able to provide
    worker protections or welfare due to their being edged out of the monetary process.
    A bleak future indeed, and closer to many of the dystopian pictures painted in
    science fiction books and films. Unfortunately, given our understanding of history,
    this is also far too believable.

    years ago, the potential for this bleak future was based around a relatively simple
    global analysis. Ultimately, a state or head of state would see a benefit from
    this degradation of pay and conditions. It may be for political ideology, a response
    to (or a threat to) the global order or simply as we have seen many times before,
    an attempt to lure global corporations or foreign investment. In any traditional
    analysis, this would spark a race to the bottom, not dissimilar to the rush to
    cut corporation taxes to attract business, where, once price (wage) competition
    is the norm, undercutting to win business, to a stage where no one can further
    undercut is the likely outcome. This however was in a stage of global order where
    national governments were acting in concert to approach (however unsatisfactorily)
    the pressing global challenges and emergencies. Here, we imagined the coordination
    of global powers, presenting a united front against the challenges of the ABC
    economy and the issues arrived around lone states refusing to participate and
    threating this approach. However, even through the writing of this book, that
    is becoming far harder to envisage. Deregulation and wage reduction, in this technological
    market place, in essence, at the whim of a political statement and accomplished
    at the increasing pace of the ABC economy, could easily ‘bring jobs back’, but
    at what cost for the worker?

- en: Overall, then, and contrary to the overall philosophy of the initial cryptocurrencies
    of decentralisation and a removal of government from the economic process, we
    advocate a strong role for government, regulation and policy action. Much of the
    initial allure of cryptocurrencies was based around the removal of government
    from the monetary process, blockchain removes intermediaries and automation may
    remove worker protections. This wholesale removal of external bodies can in essence
    be twinned with the potential for wholesale removal of any worker rights, protections
    and surplus from the work process. Indeed, it is all too easy imagine a world
    where automation and algorithmising creates a world of work solely based on the
    necessary base process for each output, a de facto world of entirely unskilled
    work and where the lack of geographic constraints simply increases competition
    for each ‘bit’ of work to where (charitably) the price for that work falls simply
    to subsistence levels. In this world, smart contracts and instantaneous infinitely
    divisible payments combine to create a global work bank, who are in effect on
    zero-hour subsistence wage contracts. We could even go further, with the ability
    for algorithms to learn and adapt, the simple act of completing a piece of ‘bit’
    work would generate more data on that process eventually leading to, via the ‘data
    exploitation’ of the Bitworker to a further reduction in the price for that piece
    of work due to efficiencies generated through the use of that additional data
    point. Unionisation would be next to impossible in its traditional form. Geographic
    freedoms and mass over supply of labour could create a race to the bottom and
    even international ‘competition’ based on diminishing worker protections and rights.

    cryptocurrencies such as Libra. Notwithstanding the debates around the corporate
    incursion into what in effect is traditionally only the province of sovereign
    governments and nation states, the issuance of money and the generation of seigniorage,
    Libra and the Libra Council are known entities. In effect, they give this currency
    a face, an entity and governments a port of call. Libra has a defined working
    structure, a platform of operation and a series of whitepapers dictating its processes.
    For the first time, a mass cryptocurrency will have a structure regulatory bodies
    that can understand and incorporate into their functions. Libra has killed the
    initial crypto promise of decentralisation and all of its inherent dangers for
    governments, by in effect becoming just another currency. If we simply imagine
    the Libra Council as just another currency board, Libra in effect becomes mundane,
    and mundane becomes safe. Libra can be incorporated relatively easily into a nation
    states taxation regime and fiscal and monetary policies. The UK’s National Insurance
    System should be able to, in effect handle an income or a portion of it in Libra
    as easily as it can handle a UK national who receives part of their income in
    Euros or Dollars. Corporate cryptocurrencies remove the decentralisation and thus
    danger of cryptocurrencies for the nation state and ironically may be vital for
    the prevention of the wholesale McDonaldisation of work. States must carefully
    choose between a powerful, but more limited in effect, challenge to their monetary
    dominance (corporate cryptocurrencies) and a weaker but potentially far more disruptive
    challenge (true decentralised cryptocurrencies). An unenviable decision, but one
    that will need to be made in the near future. Which way this goes could have significant
    implications for the world of work as well as the future of fiscal and monetary
    policy.

    the idea we discuss earlier, that a worker from today, were they transported into
    our proposed world of work, would find little familiarity, should give policy
    pause for thought. If this new world of work is as wholly different as we believe
    is possible, then the structures, organisations and safety nets of today are redundant.
    Throughout this book, we have noted that there is a bright potential future, which
    can only be realised if accompanied by farsighted, long-term and proactive policy.
    First and foremost, governments must acknowledge that the transition to this new
    way of working is more akin to rapid deindustrialisation rather than gradual technological
    change. Policy to protect the worker must be key, as must learning from failed
    policy in the past. In order to maintain prosperity and not increase (dare we
    dream to decrease) inequality, displaced workers must not lose out further. The
    displacement of the middle income worker must not be to lower wages and worse
    conditions. Graduates must not enter a transitioning labour market where their
    skills evaporate but their debt remains, and precarity must be addressed rather
    than become the norm. Mass training and technological upskilling must be a priority
    for any government, this training must be proactive and not a response to unemployment
    when the worker has already lost out, but training to allow a worker to evolve
    and adapt to their benefit within the new economy.
  prefs: []

- en: Additionally, clear and serious thought needs to be given to wider fiscal and
    monetary policy within this new world. In terms of personal taxation, one instinctively
    feels that the corporate cryptocurrencies (stablecoins) will pose less of a headache
    for governments than a myriad of transferrable and opaque tokens. However, this
    is only with regard to personal taxation, the transfer of monetary power from
    state to corporation may have a number of further issues for the global economy
    and may simply maintain the ability to tax the worker, but further increase the
    distance between the state’s claims and the corporations willingness to pay. However,
    if indeed we journey to a world of heavily increased platform working, then considerations
    to the usual duties of the employer need to be made. In order to maintain conditions
    for the worker, the provision of pensions, insurance, holiday pay and so on must
    be maintained. In particular, we would recommend that pension contributions and
    crucially employer contributions are incorporated into any smart contract, with
    similar protections against opting out and incentives to save. It is a simple
    stretch of the imagination to consider that with smart contracts a worker can
    generate and maintain their own ‘welfare and insurance’ portfolio. However, the
    state must ensure that this is not simply a race to the bottom or a further widener
    of inequality by regulating a fair minimum where employers pay their share. Ultimately,
    the cost saving to the employer from their labour supply being platform based,
    must not simply (as history tells us is all too easy) be incorporated into short-term
    profitability, but be used to create long-term sustainable conditions for the
    Bitworker.

    full and part-skilled professions when choosing their future careers. As previously
    discussed, it does not automatically follow that this will mean poorer pay and
    conditions. These detrimental impacts from the perspective of the worker tend
    only to be coupled with advancements in automations where tasks can largely be
    coded and thereby may replace human endeavour. However, where this is not the
    case, our ABCs can deliver more security over future income streams by forward
    selling Bitworker time. Students must therefore trade-off their career preferences
    against required future flexibility. However, what is clear is that there are
    little-to-no areas of work activity which this all-pervasive technology will not
    impact. Therefore, rather than seeking to run from such advancements, the best
    and continued advice would always be to study and aim to do what you are passionate
    about doing. Such passions are unlikely to feature the occupations outlined by
    Frey (2017) as being at risk from automation, for example, Data Entry Keyers,
    Library Technicians and New Accounts Clerks, etc. Instead, we would encourage
    students to aspire to more creative and higher order work activities such as artists,
    therapists, directors and consultants. A world with fewer rote accountants but
    more creativity (not creative accounting!), is likely to be one which delivers
    more worker satisfaction but whether this can deliver the required aggregate employment
    numbers to sustain an economy remains to be seen. In summary, work hard, follow
    what inspires you and ask yourself the your choice of profession could be automated
    to some extent. If ‘yes’, then be careful in your choice of vocation.

    will be mitigated. Possible solutions include a career switch, upskilling in your
    present sector, or perhaps seeking to gain promotion to managerial or leadership
    roles which may prove to be more resilient to the aforementioned threats. Moreover,

    an increased emphasis on skill development in areas such as coding and technology,
    etc. Indeed, this is already the case today and many initiatives have been launched
    to foster this desire. One such example is Scratch at [www.scratch.mit.edu](http://www.scratch.mit.edu)
    developed by Harvard Graduate School of Education which provides children with
    a basic programming language where they can build stories, music and animations
    whilst learning the basic structure and rules of a typical coding language. Given
    the nature of the technologies which we have envisioned it is key that teachers
    and lecturers build such learning in to all layers of most educational courses
    similar to that of ethics or sustainability which are often incorporated across
    all units of study given their pervasive importance. The corollary of the above
    would be a focus upon increasingly creative subjects including, but not limited
    to, creative writing, leadership, music and the arts more broadly. However, such
    subjects have typically been squeezed of late attracting increasingly smaller
    allocations of already dwindling pots of funding. Economic pressures often necessitate
    such changes especially given a world which places greater importance, status
    and employment prospects upon Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
    subjects. A balance here is obviously key as there is little advantage in training
    a generation of poets with little regard for how these individuals can find meaningful
    employment post their educational pathways.

    from the technological advancements which we have critically discussed above.
    Smart contracts will deliver greater confidence in cash flow management ensuring
    payment is obtained in good time and thereby helping business to plan with confidence
    and grow accordingly. Furthermore, the increasing commoditisation and availability
    of flexible working will allow Small to Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to more
    easily flex their employment resources in line with their business needs. This
    helps to keep operational gearing at relatively lower levels which in turn reduces
    risk for the owner manager. In contrast to the above advantages, the ABCs of our
    triumvirate are likely to disrupt and shorten many supply chains which may negate
    the need, and even perhaps the existence, of many smaller organisations.

    the Workplace*, we have made a series of (hopefully) logical assumptions and suppositions
    based upon ongoing and emerging trends and supertrends both in the study of work
    and in the wider global economy. We must however acknowledge the considerable
    issues of future forecasting. During the writing of this book, the once inevitable
    march of the corporate cryptocurrency appears to be being (at least temporarily)
    derailed. As discussed in greater detail in the recommendations section, the ‘likely’
    issuance of a global cryptocurrency is a key feature of our proposed ABC economy
    and analysis of its implications for the future of work. We ultimately believe
    that the ‘Genie is out of the bottle’ for these types of currencies and their
    eventual issuance will affect the future of working. Clearly, though, the timings
    are far less clear and dependable than they were in early 2019\. In practice,
    then, for the book and the future as written, we may well see the themes presented
    coming to pass in a very similar timescale. There is a strong possibility that
    Big Tech, a GAFA or a BAT or even an emerging entity, will learn the lessons of
    Libra and utilising a ‘send mover advantage’ successfully launch a global corporate
    cryptocurrency in Libra’s image and maybe with a smoother regulatory ride. It
    appears that elements of the trust in Big Tech which has generally outweighed
    the trust in traditional banking firms post 2008 crisis, is waning. It is this
    trust which also provides a foundation for the movement towards what we have termed
    the ABC economy. The current (October 2019 at the time of writing) increasing
    scrutiny of social media as we move towards democratic events in the UK and USA
    is shaking the trust in these technologies and firms, especially in the demographics
    which are ‘the workers of tomorrow’. Barely a day goes by without further revelations
    around the intrusion, privacy and wellbeing issues arising from social media,
    continual web connection and the overarching issue of technological progression
    outpacing cultural and societal ability to adapt. The stage here is being set
    for increasing societal, and regulatory pressures on the role and infiltration
    of tech in the world of work, and the future revelations revealed by this scrutiny
    may well further shake the trust in ABC, prompting unforeseen adaptions and adoptions
    of technology outside the scope of this book. The notions of trust in society
    are highly relevant here, the reported issues surrounding Cambridge Analytica
    and their dissemination to the wider public, the frequent notifications of missing
    cryptocurrency and its continued association with crime further serve to reduce
    societal trust in these technologies. However, the future we outline relies on
    trust in order to operate, we note that blockchain ‘replaces trust with truth’,
    and if societal trust wanes in Big Tech to such an extent, that the transparent,
    immutable and verifiable properties of blockchain and associated smart contracts
    become the only mechanism facilitating the economy, then we question, if giving
    existing trust dynamics, this will be enough to promote wholesale change in the
    world of work.'

    not so much in the Bitcoin segment, but in the stablecoins projects – and we only
