    is an agricultural drone company, making drones that map fields and perform precision
    pesticide spraying of crops. The company’s new headquarters is in a part of the
    city that is wildly empty, a new “high-tech industry area,” which so many cities
    across China are now building. The push in Guangzhou toward high-tech industries
    is an attempt to strengthen the Greater Bay Area of Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Hong
    Kong into an economic powerhouse.

    valued at US$15 billion, just two hours away in nearby Shenzhen.

    driving across California through rural counties. Stopping at a Walmart, I watched
    a young woman with a blond ponytail explaining the features of a floor mop she

    the Velcro attachment. “Saves you time, and we all know there’s not enough time
    these days. I’m a public school teacher during the week, but I’m workin’ it, even

    This is fairly typical when someone in the family has a solid, working-class government
    job with good benefits—an “iron rice bowl.” There’re still a lot of jobs like

    My cousin, growing up under the promises of the free market, wanted something

    for them. Before starting his own farm service company, Wei worked with a different
    group of farm service technicians in Anhui. Since the 1990s, small farm service
    teams have formed across rural China, as a response to the needs of a changing
    countryside. While farms stayed small, the loss of agricultural labor to urban
    areas meant a demand for help and labor on farms. Agricultural service teams started
    forming, both buying and making their own equipment that would work on these small-scale
    farms, helping farm owners harvest as well as spray pesticides and fertilizers
    throughout the year. These service teams are not just hired help, though—they
    are often at the front lines of developing new tools and new farm machinery, a
    goal that is part of the ambitious Made in China 2025 Plan to catalyze China into
    a knowledge- and service-based economy.

    suspicious of drones, they eventually realized how cost-effective drones are.
    Since the drones are more precise in their application of pesticides and fertilizers,
    farmers could save money on material costs. “Farmers think it’s really fashionable
    to use drones now, and they will tell their neighbors all about it,” the farm
    service company owner says. As of 2018, 5 percent of farming in China was done
    using precision agriculture. XAG drones are typically used by farms around three
    hectares in size, because of hardware constraints. Since 98 percent of farm households
    own small pieces of land less than two hectares, there remains ample room for
    market growth. With this potential boom and the scalability of Wei’s drone-pilot
    training, I wonder how long the field will continue to grow before there is an

    their ubiquity. Projects like the failed One Laptop per Child, by Nicholas Negroponte,

    give a laptop to a child or put a computer in an Indian slum, children will teach
    themselves linear algebra and become the next Bill Gates. We now know this is
    a myth inflated by a hype cycle. A whole support system of teachers, peers, and

    are private, sponsored by companies including Alibaba and NetEase, and others
    are experiments in public education. XAG itself is partnering with Zhonghang Future

    thousand physical flight schools across the country. By the end of 2018, more
    than twenty thousand people had finished the online training portion through WeChat.

    soybeans comes from the data content. Is it a photo of yourself with a bad haircut
    from five years ago, or a flattering headshot from your LinkedIn profile? Or is
    it yesterday’s newspaper headlines? For this recipe, we suggest going with a neutral-flavored
    data soybean, maybe some shipping transactions on a ledger or your to-do list
    from a few years ago. Or, for the brave, archived personal e-mails give the fritters
    a complex, heavy flavor with extra-crunchy texture.

    soybeans—this is a sign of bit rot in the data. Put the beans in a large glass
    bowl and soak overnight.

    have a liquid with a pulpy, smoothie-like texture.

    to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. Keep a close eye on the pot, as soy milk
    bubbles over easily! The mixture is ready when foam appears on top. Make sure
    that the soybean liquid is properly cooked through—that it has reached a boil
    and simmered for at least 10 minutes—as uncooked soybeans cause indigestion.

    burn yourself with the hot liquid!) Separate the two by placing cheesecloth over
    a container and pouring the contents of the pot onto the cheesecloth. One method
    is to place the cheesecloth over a colander, which sits on top of a container.
    Squeeze and strain out the solids, using a utensil to help mash and strain (so
    that you don’t have to use your hands). Set aside the solids.

    frequently so that it doesn’t burn. Bring the milk to a boil and then lower to
    a simmer. A light skin will start to form at the top. Skim the skin off and save
    it—it’s a delicious, tender bean curd, and considered a delicacy!

    into the wok and fry at medium heat until the outsides become crispy golden brown.
    Remove from the heat using a slotted spoon and place onto napkins. These fritters
    are great with any kind of dipping sauce.

    The lees is great in savory egg pancakes, mixed with rice and fried into cakes,
    or stewed with dates, rice, and whatever your heart desires.
