    gain to recur. But, massive increases are still quite possible—especially when

    they both rise and fall at the same time—meaning they are *positively correlated*—you’re
    no better off than if you owned just one of them. But if one of them rises while
    the other falls and vice versa—meaning they are *negatively correlated*—then your
    overall risk of loss is sharply reduced. And if you add a third asset that’s riskier
    than the other two but isn’t correlated with either of them, you not only reduce
    the overall losses of the total portfolio at any one time, you improve its overall
    returns (because the new third asset makes more money than the other two).'

    not be able to pay the interest it owes or even return your money to you upon
    maturity. But you know who the company is, so you can assess the risk by evaluating
    the reasons it’s seeking to borrow money. You can also review the company’s financial
    statements to gauge the likelihood it will be able to pay the interest and return
    the principle as promised. You can do all this because you know whom you’re lending
    the money to. But when yield farming with crypto, you have no idea who’s borrowing

    the profit for themselves. Perhaps they’ll exploit pricing differences; various
    exchanges around the world often have different prices for digital assets at the
    same time; by buying low at one exchange and simultaneously selling high on another,
    you can produce large profits (a practice known as *arbitrage*)—*if* those anomalies
    exist and *if* you can capture them. Possibly they’re going to borrow your coins,
    pay you 7.5%, and lend them to someone else who pays them 8% or more. Other gambits

    it can earn a profit if it pays $10/bushel. Even though both parties realize that
    the future price might be higher or lower, both are happy to lock in the current
    price. Thus, derivatives help the world of commerce by de-risking price fluctuations

    be, you must be right about *when* that price will be reached. Otherwise, your

    contracts often trade at prices different from that of the underlying asset. That’s

    asset on which the contract is based. For example, In October 2021, the CME price
    for bitcoin futures was 15% higher than the price for bitcoin itself, due to higher
    demand for the futures contract than for bitcoin. And sometimes, the prices of
    the contracts themselves go wacky relative to each other. There are even names

    to buy your contract and additional commissions to cancel the contract prior to
    expiration. And if you manage to profit from your trades, you’ll owe a lot of
    taxes. That’s because all this trading is *short-term*, defined by the IRS as
    occurring in a year or less. That means your profits won’t qualify for long-term
    capital gains rates. Instead, you’ll pay taxes at your top marginal Ordinary Income
    tax rate. For a lot of investors, that’s a combined federal and state rate of

    of bitcoin and 20 shares are outstanding, the NAV of each share is $5.

    one party to another. And those parties might agree on a price that’s different
    from the NAV.

    However, if you’re an accredited investor, you have an opportunity. You can invest
    in *venture capital funds*. As the name implies, capital provided by investors
    is used to buy equity in young companies. VC funds are created by both small VC
    firms and the nation’s largest brokerage firms, such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan,
    for wealthy clients, pension funds, endowments, sovereign funds (money belonging
    to a government), and institutional clients (such as insurance companies). More
    than half a trillion dollars has been placed into VC funds, according to the National
    Venture Capital Association.

    is pretty much the same except for fees—every VC fund is unique. That’s because
    each invests in a different set of early-stage companies. So, while it might not
    matter much which S&P 500 fund you buy, it matters greatly which VC fund you choose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s because, in the VC world, it’s all about *deal flow*. The manager of
    the VC fund must know about these young companies and persuade their founders
    to let the fund invest in them. Connections are key—and it explains why many VC
    funds are staffed in regions where start-ups thrive, such as Silicon Valley, Boston,
    and New York. The more companies you can evaluate, the greater your odds of finding
    the next Facebook.

- en: Each VC firm issues several VC funds—one at a time. They raise a certain amount
    of capital from investors, find companies to invest in, then launch a new fund
    and repeat the process. So, each VC fund is available only for a limited time
    and to a small number of investors. And no two VC funds are identical. Like wine,
    VCs have vintages—the 1999 funds that bought dot-com stocks before the crash did
    poorly, while the 2009 funds that invested after the credit crisis did well.

    your tax return. Your preparer’s fee will rise—and you’ll most likely have to

    selling* (a bet that the value of a company will fall, not rise), and *leverage*
    (borrowing money to invest more capital than is provided by investors, which can
    increase returns but losses as well).

    they self-terminate in 5 to 10 years, hedge funds are *open-end funds*, like mutual
    funds. In other words, investors can almost always acquire or redeem shares. I
    say “almost” because hedge funds sometimes close those windows—either refusing
    to accept new money or limiting the ability of current investors to sell. As you
    might imagine, those “gates” tend to open and close when the markets are performing
    particularly well (they won’t accept new money) or poorly (you can’t sell).

    10 times more money.

    The harmonic mean reveals the *average cost*, while the arithmetic mean reveals
    the *average price*. Since harmonic means are always lower than arithmetic means,
    the average cost is always lower than the average price! Dollar cost averaging
    therefore always produces a profit!^([II](#footnote-040))

    that happen for us automatically. You get more shares when prices are lower, and
    you get fewer shares when prices are higher. Thus, you accumulate shares in a
    cost-efficient manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    accounts always have a stable $1 price, so DCA offers no particular benefit. The
    stock market is volatile, though, and that’s why DCA is a common strategy for
    stock investments. And you can apply it to digital assets just as effectively.

    investments that made the most money, and to buy the investments that made the
