- en: If you've read anything about cryptocurrency, you've heard the term "mining"
    repeated quite often. While you may have a pretty good idea of what mining is
    in the physical sense, you may be a little confused about its role in the world
    of digital currencies.

    A crucial part of this process is what is called mining. While the process happens
    with all digital currencies, we’ll use the Bitcoin as our primary example as we
    explain this rather complicated process.

    that issued it however with cryptocurrency, there is no governmental backing,
    so how is the value determined? Essentially, it comes from a complicated series
    of mathematical computations referred to as “mining.” The purpose of these calculations
    is twofold,

    you can gain. Imagine being able to earn thousands of Bitcoins simply by running
    a program on your computer.

- en: This is one of the key reasons why this system has become wildly successful.
    As a miner, for each new coin you discover as your computer trolls through the
    system, you will be rewarded. It is a highly popular way to earn money and support
    the system at the same time. Also, miners collect transaction fees each time they
    add a block to the Blockchain.

    to become a cryptocurrency miner, then you will have to have more than just a

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CPU or the Central Processing Unit is the key component in your computer
    that handles the everyday processes that your system needs. Its primary purpose
    is to make the big decisions for your computer's functions. It is comprised of
    the electronic circuitry and performs all the functions of a computer program.
    While in the beginning, this was the only way to mine for currency, it was not
    the most efficient.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the CPU is no longer the primary way to mine cryptocurrency, it is still
    used to earn a little money on the network. Many miners will use their CPU to
    join a mining pool. By doing this, they can combine their computing power with
    others to earn money. The potential for earning will still be limited in this
    way, but if you're just interested in a few earnings, you can definitely garner
    a little cash this way.

    It manages the graphics processing and does all the complex mathematical computations
    involved in running videos. It is much faster than CPU mining and is considerably
    more powerful.

    to mining. It is considered to be the next level of mining as it has increased
    the speed and efficiency of mining many times over. An added bonus of setting
    up your mining platform using the FPGA is that it draws very little power and
    you can keep it running 24-hours a day earning your profit around the clock.

    Integrated Circuit chips. First introduced in 2013, they have been steadily improving
    with each passing year. Like the FPGA, they have only one job, and that is to
    mine 24/7.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to mining, speed is extremely important, and with new hardware
    like the FPGA and the ASIC, older and slower systems will never be able to compete.
    While you can still mine with CPUs and GPUs, your potential for profit in the
    world of mining will depend largely on how fast your computer can troll the network
    for those transactions.

    can do that, however, you need to decide if you’re going to be a lone miner or
    join a pool. Depending on which avenue you choose to take you’ll have to set up
    your mining business differently.

    blocks. For some, it has taken years before they were able to generate a block
    and earn a piece of the pie so joining a pool is much more practical for those
    who don’t mind sharing the reward. It will require a smaller investment but increase
    the rewards exponentially. You will earn an income on a more regular basis.

    it works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you think of a Blockchain, it is best to try to visualize it as a public
    ledger that is constantly being updated every second. It is not under any central
    control, but as each transaction is completed, it is added to the ledger keeping
    a running total of everything that is happening with that particular cryptocurrency.
    The miner's job is to find those Bitcoins, validate each transaction and record
    every completed transaction as a new block on the Blockchain.

    where more than one confirmation may be necessary to ensure the validity of the
    transaction.
