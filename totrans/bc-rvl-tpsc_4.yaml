- en: This book came from the meeting of two minds and two life trajectories. Don
    had been leading a $4 million syndicated research program called Global Solution
    Networks (GSN) at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. The
    initiative was investigating new, networked models of global problem solving and
    governance. He researched how the Internet was governed by a multistakeholder
    ecosystem and became interested in digital currencies and their governance. Meanwhile,
    Alex was an executive with the investment bank Canaccord Genuity. He noticed the
    growing enthusiasm for early-stage bitcoin and blockchain companies in 2013 and
    began leading his firm’s efforts in the space. During a father-son ski trip to
    Mont-Tremblant in early 2014, we brainstormed over dinner about collaborating
    on this topic, and Alex agreed to lead a research project on the governance of
    digital currencies, culminating in his white paper, titled *A Bitcoin Governance
    Network*. The more we dug into the issues, the more we concluded that this could
    be the next big thing.

- en: Meanwhile our agent, Wes Neff at the Leigh Bureau, along with Don’s publisher
    Adrian Zackheim at Portfolio/Penguin (*Wikinomics*, *Macrowikinomics*), was encouraging
    Don to formulate a new book concept. When Alex’s paper became widely recognized
    as leading thinking in this area, Don approached Alex to be his coauthor. Adrian,
    to his credit, made us an offer we couldn’t refuse and the book never went to
    auction, as is normally the case.

- en: We then made what in hindsight was a smart decision. We approached the best
    book editor we knew, Kirsten Sandberg, formerly of Harvard Business School Press,
    and asked her to edit our book proposal. She did a spectacular job and our collaboration
    was so effortless that we asked her to be a full-time member of the book research
    team. Kirsten participated with us in more than one hundred interviews and collaborated
    in real time as we tried to understand the myriad issues on the table and develop
    helpful formulations to explain this extraordinary set of developments to a nontechnical
    audience. She helped us bring the story to life. In that sense, she was our coauthor
    and this book would not have appeared, at least in its current comprehensible
    form, without her. For that, and for all the stimulation and laugh lines, we are
    very grateful.

    Anthony Williams and Joan Bigham of the GSN project worked closely with Alex on
    the original digital currencies governance paper. Former Cisco executive Joan
    McCalla did deep research for the chapters on the Internet of Things and also
    Government and Democracy. We received a lot of familial support. IT executive
    Bob Tapscott spent many days downloading and getting under the hood of the entire
    bitcoin blockchain to give us firsthand insights on some of the technical issues.
    Technology entrepreneur Bill Tapscott came up with the revolutionary idea of a
    blockchain-based personal carbon credit trading system, and technology executive
    Niki Tapscott and her husband, financial analyst James Leo, have been great sounding
    boards throughout. Katherine MacLellan of the Tapscott Group (conveniently a lawyer)
    tackled some of the tougher issues around smart contracts as well as managing
    the interview process. Phil Courneyeur was on the lookout daily for juicy material,
    and David Ticoll provided helpful insights about the state of the digital age
    so far. Wes Neff and Bill Leigh of the Leigh Bureau helped us craft the book concept
    (how many books is this, guys?). As always (now more than twenty years), Jody
    Stevens flawlessly managed the administration for the entire project including
    databases, finances, and document management, as well as the proofreading and
    production process—a full-time job, in addition to her other full-time jobs at
    the Tapscott Group.

    Joseph Lubin, CEO of the Ethereum development studio Consensus Systems; and Carlos
    Moreira of fast-growing security company WISeKey—who each spent considerable time
    with us brainstorming ideas. They are each brilliant and so kind to help us out.
    Now we get to enjoy witnessing the success of each of their businesses in this
    space. Also big thanks to the great team at Penguin Random House led by our editor
    Jesse Maeshiro and overseen by Adrian Zackheim.

    (Don) and Amy Welsman (Alex), who more than tolerated our obsession with cracking
    this big nut over the better part of a year. We are both very fortunate to have
    such wonderful life partners.

    to say that we loved every minute of it. As someone famous once said, “If two
    people agree on everything, one of them is unnecessary.” We challenged each other
    daily to test our beliefs and assumptions, and this book is living proof of that
    healthy and vigorous collaboration. Mind you, collaborating does seem effortless
    when you share so much DNA and have a shared thirty-year history of exploring
    the world together. We do hope you find the product of this collaboration important
    and helpful.
