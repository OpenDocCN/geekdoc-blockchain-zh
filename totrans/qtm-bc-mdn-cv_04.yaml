  zh: 摘要
- en: This chapter delves into the domain of photonics quantum computing and its applications.
    Unlike classical computing, photonics quantum computing exploits photons for the
    basic model of computation, which is due to their low or negligible loss and the
    fact that they can operate at room temperature which is also very promising. The
    Photonic Quantum Computers aptly satisfy five out of seven Vincenzo’s conditions.
    Consequently, extensive research has been done for the physical realization of
    scalable Photonic Quantum Computers, because of their covenanting properties like
    scalability, and their robust nature towards fault-tolerance making it an interesting
    and nearly viable candidate as a quantum computer. Photonic Quantum Computers
    include a wide variety of applications from Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum
    Cryptography to Quantum Key Distribution.

  zh: 1 介绍
- en: From being as big as a room to be as small as smartphones, classical computers
    have come a long way. Over time, they have gained high speed and processing. The
    evolution of computing technology came with the invention of transistors, which,
    as time passed, grew smaller and smaller in size, leading to higher speed, low
    operational power and more compactness. According to Moore’s law (more precisely
    it is an observation), the population of transistors on a silicon chip becomes
    approximately twice every 18 months. Unfortunately, there is a limitation to how
    small a transistor can be. When it reaches the size of the atomic level, the laws
    of classical mechanics fail as the physics at the atomic level is governed by
    the laws of Quantum Mechanics. Due to the quantum mechanical behaviour of electrons
    in such a small transistor, the phenomena of quantum tunnelling [[30](#CR30)]
    can occur which in turn leads to the leakage of information and produce wrong
    computational results.

    [[30](#CR30)] 可能发生，这反过来会导致信息泄漏并产生错误的计算结果。
- en: To overcome this drawback, Quantum computers have popped up as the most promising
    technology for the future as it guarantees to deliver limitless computational
    power and solve problems that would not be possible for current classical computers
    to solve [[40](#CR40)]. Quantum computers use quantum mechanical properties, like
    superposition and entanglement to process information. The paper on the EPR paradox,
    proposed by Einstein et al. [[11](#CR11)] is an interesting read, challenging
    the incompleteness of quantum mechanics which lead to the discovery of an interesting
    state, called the Bell State. Every electronic device used a bit as the unit of
    information while the quantum computers use qubit as the single unit of information
    which is fundamentally different from the bit. The important difference is that
    a single qubit can be represented as a linear combination of two. For instance,
    a single bit is either a ‘0’ or ‘1’ while a single qubit is expressed as ![$$
    \left| {\psi } \right\rangle =\alpha \left| {0} \right\rangle +\beta \left| {1}
    \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq1.png),
    where ![$$\alpha $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq2.png)
    and ![$$\beta $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq3.png)
    are two complex number whose magnitude squared represents the probability of occurrence
    of the corresponding state. This allows the qubit to be in both the state at the
    same time and is called a superposition of state. If we consider the 2-qubit system,
    then there exist some states in which both the qubits are said to be entangled
    together. The bell states are the most popular entangled states. ![$$ \left| {\psi
    } \right\rangle =\frac{ \left| {00} \right\rangle + \left| {11} \right\rangle
    }{\sqrt{2}}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq4.png)
    is one of the bell states. If we measure the first qubit as ‘0’ or ‘1’, the second
    qubit will always be ‘0’ or ‘1’ respectively. This phenomenon where the state
    of one qubit changes the state of the other qubit is known as the entanglement
    and it even persists when both the individual qubits are far apart spatially.

  zh: 要克服这一缺点，量子计算机已经成为未来最有前途的技术，因为它保证提供无限的计算能力，并解决目前经典计算机无法解决的问题[[40](#CR40)]。量子计算机利用量子力学的特性，如叠加和纠缠来处理信息。爱因斯坦等人提出的EPR悖论的论文[[11](#CR11)]是一个有趣的阅读材料，挑战了量子力学的不完整性，导致了一个有趣状态的发现，称为贝尔态。每个电子设备都使用位作为信息的单位，而量子计算机使用量子位作为信息的单个单位，这与位基本不同。重要的区别在于单个量子位可以表示为两个的线性组合。例如，单个位要么是‘0’要么是‘1’，而单个量子位表示为
    ![$$ \left| {\psi } \right\rangle =\alpha \left| {0} \right\rangle +\beta \left|
    {1} \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq1.png)，其中
    ![$$\alpha $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq2.png)
    和 ![$$\beta $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq3.png)
    是两个复数，其模的平方代表相应状态发生的概率。这使得量子位能够同时处于两种状态，并称为状态的叠加。如果我们考虑2量子位系统，那么存在一些状态，其中两个量子位称为纠缠在一起。贝尔态是最受欢迎的纠缠态。
    ![$$ \left| {\psi } \right\rangle =\frac{ \left| {00} \right\rangle + \left| {11}
    \right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq4.png)
    是其中一个贝尔态。如果我们测量第一个量子位为‘0’或‘1’，第二个量子位将始终分别为‘0’或‘1’。这种现象，其中一个量子位的状态改变了另一个量子位的状态，被称为纠缠，即使当两个个体量子位在空间上相距很远时，这种现象仍然存在。
- en: These qubits can perform algorithms by operators called quantum gates. Quantum
    gates are unitary matrices which when operated on the qubit changes either the
    state or the phase of the quantum gate. For example, the Pauli-X gate is a flip
    gate. Its function is to convert ![$$ \left| {0} \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq5.png)
    to ![$$ \left| {1} \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq6.png)
    and ![$$ \left| {1} \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq7.png)
    to ![$$ \left| {0} \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq8.png).
    In other words, it flips the state of the qubit. Some famous quantum gates and
    their symbol along with their unitary representation is given in the Fig. [1](#Fig1).
    To create a qubit it is necessary to have a quantum mechanical systems which retain
    its quantum mechanical behaviour for at least a long time and must evolve as desired.

    is searching for an alternative for the production of fertilizers. Fertilizer
    production uses an appreciable percentage of Natural gas which comes with consequences
    like, high cost, energy waste and greenhouse gas emissions. To solve this problem
    a quantum computer needs approximately 200 fault-tolerant qubits. Current quantum
    computers are noisy and small. That merely means quantum computers need scaling
    up of the number of qubits. It is not an easy task of integrating more and more
    qubit systems into the quantum computer. Underlying physics, operational environment
    and engineering aspects pose a greater challenge in scaling up the qubits.

    that their physical properties must be known precisely. These properties include
    the Hamiltonian of the qubit, coupling with different states of the qubits, how
    one qubit interacts with the others, and its coupling with the external fields
    which can be used to manipulate the state of the qubits. Also, the control apparatus
    must have the ability to control the qubit from going to the states above the
    second level because by definition the qubit is a two-level quantum system, meaning
    that a qubit must only have two levels or if it has more than two states then
    the probability of the states above the second state must be very small.

    on a CPU. A variable that is created is initialized and given some amount of memory
    space in the CPU. If the user does not define any value to the variable in the
    code then the CPU assigns it a garbage value. Running the algorithm with the variable
    having a garbage value destroys the logic of the code. Analogous to this, running
    an algorithm on a quantum computer also needs the qubits to be initialized to
    a certain simple state. Also, initialization plays an important role in quantum
    error correction [[9](#CR9)] which needs qubits in low-entropy states or ground
    states mapped to ![$$ \left| {0} \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq10.png).
    Two ways to initialize the qubits to the natural lowest entropy state is either
    by lowering the temperature of the system to the ground state or performing the
    measurement collapsing the qubits to the required states or the states that can
    be rotated to the one needed.

    are complex coefficients whose modulus square represents the probability of the
    outcome of the corresponding state. Broadly, there are two types of quantum gates,
    namely, a single qubit gate and a two-qubit controlled gate. The single-qubit
    gates are used to perform changes in the complex coefficient of the qubits while
    the two-qubit control gate is used to change the state of the target qubit based
    on the state of the control qubit. For example, for Controlled NOT, only if the
    state control qubit is ![$$ \left| {1} \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq17.png),
    the gate does not operate otherwise it is the target qubit left unchanged.

    $$ \left| {1} \right\rangle $$ 时，门才起作用，否则目标比特保持不变。
- en: The properties of the photons, like, polarization, propagation direction and
    arrival time, can be used to build qubits. Let’s take the case of polarization.
    A photon has two discrete polarization forms, namely, Horizontal and Vertical.
    So a single photon qubit based on polarization can be represented as, ![](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_IEq18_HTML.gif),
    where *V* and *H* represent the Vertical and Horizontal polarization, respectively.
    While 0 and 1 represent the number of photons. The single gate operations can
    be performed by changing the angle of polarization of the photon. The change in
    the angle of polarization can be achieved by using components like waveplate.
    A waveplate is an optical device that is used to change the polarization of light
    when light travels through it. The two-qubit control-not gate can be created by
    phase-shifting the target qubit by ![$$\pi $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq19.png).
    By shifting the phase of the target photon by ![$$\pi $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq20.png)
    relative to the phase of the control photon, the polarization flips to the opposite
    side to the initial polarization of the target photon. This phase-shifting effect
    can be realized using the Kerr-Effect, which is the phenomena of the change in
    the refractive index of the material due to the applied electric field, and the
    change of refractive index is proportional to the power of the input light which
    in turn brings about the shift in the phase of the light as it travels through
    the material. It is important to know that the Kerr effect is a non-linear optical
    phenomenon.

  zh: 光子的性质，比如偏振、传播方向和到达时间，可以用来构建量子比特。让我们以偏振为例。光子有两种离散的偏振形式，即，水平和垂直。因此，基于偏振的单光子量子比特可以表示为，![](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_IEq18_HTML.gif)，其中*V*和*H*分别表示垂直和水平偏振。而0和1表示光子的数量。单门操作可以通过改变光子的偏振角来实现。通过使用像波片这样的元件，可以实现偏振角的变化。波片是一种光学器件，当光通过它时，可以改变光的偏振。两量子比特控制非门可以通过将目标量子比特的相位移动
    ![$$\pi $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq19.png)来创建。通过将目标光子的相位相对于控制光子的相位移动
    ![$$\pi $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq20.png)，偏振会翻转到目标光子初始偏振的对立面。这种相位移效应可以通过克尔效应来实现，克尔效应是由于施加的电场而导致材料的折射率变化的现象，折射率的变化与输入光的功率成正比，从而导致光在材料中传播时相位的变化。重要的是要知道，克尔效应是一种非线性光学现象。
- en: Knill et al. [[20](#CR20)], together proposed a method to build a scalable photonic
    quantum computer using linear optics only. They proposed a method for devising
    the probabilistic Controlled-Not (CNOT) gate. The success rate of the gate was
    measured on the algorithm of quantum teleportation, which is an algorithm to transfer
    the state of one qubit to another qubit. However, to avoid the probabilistic nature
    of the CNOT gate, an infinitely large number of ancillary photons qubits are required.
    Hence the resource requirement is not realistic and thus, this approach fails
    to build a deterministic CNOT gate. Also, probabilistic CNOT hinders the scalability
    of photonic quantum computing.

    discrete states, as we saw in the case of polarization of photons. The Continous
    Variable approach, as the name suggests has no discrete states but continuous
    states. So, it is better represented mathematically in Eq. ([1](#Equ1)).![$$\begin{aligned}
    \left| {\psi } \right\rangle =\int \limits _{-\infty }^{\infty } \psi (x) \left|
    {x} \right\rangle d x \end{aligned}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ1.png)(1)Here

    may or may not be the position operator) and the information is stored inside
    the function, ![$$\psi (x)$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq24.png).
    In the case of photonic systems, the wave function, ![$$ \left| {\psi } \right\rangle
    $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq25.png), can
    be expressed as photon number states given in Eq. ([2](#Equ2)),![$$\begin{aligned}
    \left| {\psi } \right\rangle =\sum _{n=0}^{\infty } c \left| {n} \right\rangle
    \end{aligned}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ2.png)(2)Here
    *c* is a constant and is represented as ![$$c= \left\langle {n} \right| \left.
    {\psi } \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq26.png).
    *n* is the number of photons and ![$$ \left| {n} \right\rangle $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq27.png)
    is the number photon states. So, to get binary states, *n* runs from 0 to 1\.
    In this approach, the unitary transformation can be executed by using the Hamiltonian
    of the operators, ![$$\widehat{x}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq28.png)
    and ![$$\widehat{p}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq29.png).
    The mathematical form of the arbitrary unitary transformation can be expressed
    by Eq. ([3](#Equ3)).![$$\begin{aligned} \widehat{U} = e^{-i\left( \frac{Ht}{\hbar
    }\right) } \end{aligned}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ3.png)(3)In
    the above equation *H* is the Hamiltonian of the respective operators.To implement
    quantum teleportation using this approach it is needed to prepare squeezed states
    of light which in turn requires non-linear optics. Since it is the only part of
    the circuit that needs non-linear optics, the other parts of the circuit can be
    developed with linear optics.In the circuit, two squeezed photons are created,
    with one squeezed in one quadrature while the other in the other quadrature. Each
    quadrature is represented by ![$$\widehat{x}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq30.png)
    and ![$$\widehat{p}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq31.png).
    In the case of photonics, ![$$\widehat{x}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq32.png)
    and ![$$\widehat{p}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq33.png)
    are amplitude and phase respectively [[15](#CR15)]. By the term squeezing it can
    be understood that the quantum fluctuation/uncertainty in any one quadrature is
    made to reach approximately 0\. For example, ![$$\Delta x\rightarrow 0$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq34.png)
    (uncertainty in the respective quantity). The two squeezed states are mixed in
    a beam splitter which generates two branches of the beams. One branch is mixed
    with input state which is to be teleported and the two output branch created at
    this mixing is measured using the homodyne detectors. The measurement allows us
    to determine the values of ![$$\widehat{x}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq35.png)
    and ![$$\widehat{p}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq36.png).
    While the other branch from the mixing of the squeezed states is displaced by
    using the electro-optic modulator according to the measured values in the former
    branch. Figure [2](#Fig2) shows the circuit for quantum teleportation using a
    continuous-variable approach. This kind of quantum teleportation is deterministic.
    The only problem is that the squeezed photons that are created must have to squeeze
    the quantum fluctuation to complete 0 which means infinite squeezing must occur,
    which is a limitation as it would need infinite energy.![](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.png)

    the time domain, each of the continuously produced squeezed states of light pulses
    is marked by the time interval at which they were produced. These states are coupled
    to each other by introducing a suitable time delay. For example, if a squeezed

- en: Any system which can run undisturbed even after the failure of one or more parts
    of the system, then this property of the system is known as fault-tolerance of
    the system. In the literature of Quantum Computation, the Fault tolerance of a
    Quantum Computer is well described with the Quantum threshold theorem. Accordingly,
    if the amount of noise for each quantum operation, using the qubit approach, is
    below a certain threshold then the scaling of the quantum computer is possible
    [[21](#CR21)]. Since the foundation of Photonic quantum computers is cluster states
    (discussed in the previous section), the Quantum Threshold theorem is not fully
    applicable here. This is because they’re fundamentally different from the qubit
    approach.

- en: There have been successful attempts to modify the existing fault-tolerant techniques
    to the model of cluster states. Nielsen and Dawson [[32](#CR32)] in their paper,
    proposed two threshold theorems. The first theorem is valid for those quantum
    computing process which uses the entangling gates deterministically. The second
    one is valid for the non-deterministic entangling gate. The second theorem is
    specifically modified for some proposed implementations like optical cluster-states.
    The proofs of the two theorems does not account for the error due to a leak of
    information similar to photon loss. There have been some numerical simulations
    of such models, taking the leakage into account. One such simulation was done
    by Dawson et al. [[8](#CR8)] in which they used noises like photon loss and depolarizing
    noise to obtain a threshold value. On a rough scale if the probability of the
    photon loss is less than ![$$3\times 10^{-3}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq41.png)
    and that of the depolarization is less than ![$$10^{-4}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq42.png)
    then we can say that the cluster state quantum computation is fault-tolerant.

    the error rate in the output obtained must be lower than that of the corresponding
    non-fault tolerant circuit with an error rate less than the threshold value. Though

    a dilution refrigerator works. It consists of various chambers and connected pipelines.
    Inside the system, there are two isotopes of Helium. Let them be known as 1 and
    2\. Isotope 1 is lighter than isotope 2\. There is a small pool of isotope 2 at
    the bottom chamber of the system. The chamber is also known as the mixing chamber.
    The isotope 1 is pumped into it. At this chamber, the isotope 1 gets diluted into
    the pool of isotope 2\. This results in an increase in the entropy as a consequence
    of which the heat from the surrounding of the chamber is absorbed. The mixing
    chamber consists of a pipeline connecting to the upper distilling chamber. The
    absorption of heat is used up to evaporate isotope 1 as it has a higher boiling
    point. Isotope 1 reaches the pump. The reduction of the concentration of isotope
    1 in the mixing chamber results in the drawing of more isotope 1 from the side
    of the pump and the cycle continues.

    generation and photon counting devices. Let us start with photon-counting devices.
    Photon detectors or simply PDs are the devices that are used for the detection
    and counting of photons. They are characterised by the parameters like photon
    detection efficiency ![$$\eta _d$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq46.png),

    Photon detection efficiency is defined as the probability of successful photon
    detection when a single photon is given as the input. While the dark count is
    the detection that occurs even when there are no actual photons. PNR is the ability
    of the device to resolve or to count the total photons present in a single incident
    pulse. Timing jitter measures the variation of the delay between input and output
    signal in different events of detection of photons. In an ideal PD, detection
    efficiency must be 100% and detection time jitter must be 0\. Also, reset time,
    which is the time the PD takes to reset itself after the detection of a photon,
    should ideally be 0\. And it can be considered that an ideal PD also have 0 dark
    counts.

- en: There is a pool of photon detectors which include Photomultiplier Tube (PMT),
    Single-photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD), Quantum-dot field-effect transistor-based
    detector, Superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD), Superconducting
    Transition Edge Sensor (TES). These can be used as single-photon detectors but
    have their limitations to be used for Photonic QC. SNSPDs are one good candidate
    with an operational temperature of 3 K. They are based on a nanowire in a superconducting
    state. The wire consists of an electronic current just below the critical current.
    When the photons hit the device, the energy of the photon is absorbed which causes
    the small part of the wire to transition from the superconducting state to a normal
    state where it acquires a normal resistance and the current density increases
    above the critical value. That same spot develops a peak voltage signal indicating
    detection of the photon. There are two schemes proposed to be used in the case
    SNSPDs. One, in which the nanowires are connected parallelly. The sum of the current
    in each wire is proportional to the number of wires which transitioned from superconducting
    state to normal state. This scheme has an approximately ![$$0.15\%$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq50.png)
    dark count rate and 80 MHz of repetition rate when demonstrated using niobium
    nitride nanowire 100 nm in width with the capability of detecting up to 4 photons
    [[13](#CR13)]. The other scheme also uses the same parallel configuration of the
    wires but here each wire acts as a single detector. This gives a digital output
    in the form of the count of the number of photons detected in each wire. When
    demonstrated using four wires, the detection efficiency was found to be 25% [[17](#CR17)].
    For infrared photons, SNSPDs have shown up to 93% efficiency [[27](#CR27)]. These
    detectors need a cryogenic temperature of up to 3 K. Although the performance
    of the device makes it usable for quantum communications, due to very low operational
    temperature, commercialization of photonic quantum computers become difficult.

    This device is a so-called bolometer. It senses the absorbed EM radiation based

    is very small and hence can sense a photon. The temperature rise is also proportional
    to the number of photons absorbed. The sensor is kept superconducting close to
    the normal state. So, whenever a photon is absorbed by the material there occurs
    a sudden large change in the resistance followed by the reduction in the current
    and makes the heat capacity of the material less. This device has a 95% detection
    efficiency for the incident wavelength of 1556 nm and 81–91% efficiency for the

- en: There are broadly two types of single-photon source processes, deterministic
    and non-deterministic. Formal is the one that generates photons in every trial
    with a 100% guarantee while the latter generates photons with some probability.
    Spontaneous Parametric Down-conversion (SPDC) is one of the potential non-deterministic
    methods for generating photons. In this phenomenon, the high energy photon is
    converted into two photons of lower energy. The phenomenon occurs as per the law
    of energy and momentum conservation. It closely satisfies all the 3 conditions
    mentioned above but works at a very low probability of photon generation. SPDC
    in its typical form is the cost-effective way to generate single photons but is
    distant from being used for Photonic Quantum Computing. There are two problems
    related to the SPDC when in its typical form. First, it does not provide efficient
    coupling with single-mode optical fibre. It is due to its transverse profile in
    the spatial domain which does not match that of a Gaussian profile of a single-mode
    fiber. Secondly, a photon that is pumped, is converted into a daughter pair. The
    twins are entangled together in frequency, intrinsically. The detection of the
    presence of one photon to proclaim the other’s presence demeans the purity of
    other photons if done without the resolving of the wavelength [[14](#CR14)]. To
    be used for PQC, it needs to integrate various techniques. Quasi Phase Matching
    (QPM) and Group Velocity Matching (GVM) improve the SPDC to make it compatible
    with Photonic Quantum Computing. GVM helps in removing leftover or unwanted spectral
    entanglement in down-converted photons [[14](#CR14)] while QPM allows increasing
    the range of possible phase matching and geometries of emissions [[5](#CR5)].
    These developments get it close to satisfying the 3 conditions. The photons generated
    must be high quality, consequently, the power of the pumped photon is kept low
    or else many photon pairs will be generated. This enforces the probability of
    photon generation to be lower than 1%. Hence, making it a drawback.

- en: For deterministic photon sources, we have quantum dots. These are artificially
    created nanostructures that use quantum confinement to confine the motion of the
    electrons or holes or excitons in the conduction band, valence band or the spatial
    dimensions, respectively. When UV light falls on them, they release the light
    of different colours. Quantum dot, unlike SPDC, can couple with the optical fiber
    more efficiently but as of now, coupling attained using quantum dots is ![$${\le
    }33$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq51.png)% [[45](#CR45)].
    Also, It is important to note that each quantum dot is different in terms of its
    emission spectrum. They already are at nano-scale which makes it more difficult
    to keep their structure and their interaction with its environment of a similar
    nature. Consequently, making them spectrally different. So, the photon from quantum
    dots may be distinguishable which disregards the second condition mentioned at
    the beginning of this section, hence limiting the use of multiple quantum dots
    as a photon source. The solution for this is to use a single quantum dot as the
    source to generate the number of photons needed and then multiplex them in the
    time domain (discussed in the section of the Continuous Variable Approach). These
    limitations are creating challenges which in turn is leading to intensive research
    and experimental work. Thus, speeding up the development of photonic quantum computing.

    state is certain as a squeezed state, when the reduction of noise or interactions
    in one variable is at the cost of increased interactions in another complementary
    variable, keeping the uncertainty constant. Such quantum squeezed states have
    been proven to exist decades ago. This discovery certain the varied applications
    where their properties could be exploited, like in interferometers, spectrometers,
    contribution in both experimental and theoretical work and so on. In addition
    to these, the present-day squeezed quantum states can be used to boost precision-based
    experiments. Say, amplitude-squeezed light could be used to refine amplitude read-outs,
    phase-squeezed for phase-readouts, frequency-squeezed for frequency readouts and
    so on. In earlier times, high precision experiments which used quantum squeezed
    states were the detection of gravitational waves using interferometers. This was
    a breakthrough. Devices are built to exploit the squeezing of light property by
    reducing the inherent uncertainty of quantum states of light by that device, be
    it optical fibres or interferometers. As we know, low losses are offered by optical
    fibres over long distances. Hence, reducing the effect of noise to a light beam,

    light from a common source is subjected to a splitter which then adapts to different
    optical paths. These optical paths are combined again to produce interference.
    The intensity (or in most cases the resultant amplitude) of this combined optical
    path decides whether the combination is constructive or destructive. If the light
    waves from these optical paths arrive in phase then the interference is constructive,
    and if out of phase it is destructive. In other words, in constructive interference,

    photodetectors for measurement or recording of these two optical waves. We will
    learn more about photodetectors in the following sections. The optical path lengths
    of these two optical waves can be the same or different (RP Photonics Encyclopedia—Interferometers,
    Types, Operation Principle, Mach-Zehnder, Michelson, Fabry-Perot, n.d.). The resultant
    power is the modulus difference of the optical wavelength (or frequency) and the
    optical path lengths.

    From Fig. [5](#Fig5), it can be observed that this interferometer used a single
    Beam Splitter (BS) to separate and recombine the light beams from a single common
    light source. In the Fig. [5](#Fig5), the mirrors are aligned at right angles
    to each other, following this alignment only one output light beam is accessed
    and another one is sent back to the light source. In most cases this optical feedback
    is unwanted, so this feedback can be collected in a different location with the
    different alignment of the beam splitters.

    the desired frequency range. A local oscillator is used to increase the frequency
    of the input signal by mixing the input signal with a higher frequency reference
    signal, mostly using an active mixer. The resultant signal is a non-linear combination
    of the former frequencies, now called heterodynes. The heterodyne detection technique
    is widely used in superheterodyne receivers or superhet, invented in 1918.

- en: Waveguides are structures through which waves like electromagnetic waves and
    sound waves are passed from one point to another in a medium subjecting to almost
    no losses during the transmission. What is the point of a waveguide? Why do we
    want to use a waveguide? Let’s start this section with an example. Say, A is Alice
    and B is Bob. Now, Alice would like to send some kind of data to Bob. How would
    she do it? So, might as well she could yell towards him. Maybe, she can use her
    phone or other means of communication too. Now, say A and B are a few kilometres
    apart. Transmission of information from A to B can now be subjected to some obstacle
    or attenuation. Now, if the distance between A and B is thousands of kilometres,
    then attenuation is a serious problem. So, this is why we want to use waveguides.
    Now, rather than Alice yelling into a void to transmit information to Bob, she
    yells into a pipe. Now, as long as no obstacle in this pipe will lead to attenuation
    or diminishing of Alice’s voice, all the output power will make it to Bob. In
    other words, there is no loss in the pipe and none of A’s voice is absorbed or
    lost inside the pipe (Fig. [8](#Fig8)).![](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Fig6_HTML.png)

    uses a light signal to send this information via an optical fibre. As soon as
    Alice has a transmitter and Bob has a receiver coupled to this optical fibre,
    a 100% output power is sourced to Bob. The attenuation of an optical fibre is
    in terms of dB/km, so we might get only 20% of the power lost in comparison to
    the loss via other means [[28](#CR28)]. Well, now an optical fibre is a waveguide
    for guiding light in restricted regions so that there are minimum losses in the
    transmission. In most cases, the refractive index inside the waveguide (here core)
    is more in comparison to the surrounding medium (here cladding), so that light
    does not leave the guided medium or gets lost or absorbed in the medium. Refractive
    index is one of the main factors which decides the light propagation in the guided
    material (waveguide) and also the scalability of the integration of photonic devices
    with the waveguide.

    to various optical measurables (like power meters) is imperative to monitor, record
    and analyse the detection performed by them. Sensitivity and responsivity are
    two important factors that a photodetector has to fulfil to be reliable to a system.
    Some systems particularly work based on the active area of detection of the photodetector
    integrated into their system. One such example is of a laser diode, they have
    constant or high beam divergence, so the sensitivity of the photodetector here
    plays a major role.

    numbers, which are then utilized in various applications like encryption, cryptography,
    bioscience and so on, is coined as Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG). The
    inherent nature of quantumness (which is coherence) is revealed by the measurement
    of the quantum systems. This inherent nature helps to differentiate quantum and
    classical mechanics. So, Quantum Random Number Generators are devices that measure
    the quantumness of a system, which in nature is termed as non-deterministic. There
    are three types of QRNGs; practical, self-testing and semi-self testing QRNGs
    [[26](#CR26)]. The practical QRNGs can evaluate randomness at a very high speed
    and are built of highly securable and calibrated devices. In self-testing QRNGs,
    the randomness can be measured by self-implementing the model for the measurement
    of quantum randomness. Last but not the least, semi-self testing QRNGs are a tradeoff
    between the previous two systems.

- en: A typical architecture of a neural network is composed of an input layer followed
    by the hidden layers and terminating with an output layer. Each layer is constructed
    as a stack of nodes. Each node holds a certain value. For the input layer, the
    node holds the numerical values of the features of the dataset (dataset contains
    data points, ![$$\mathbf {x}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq57.png),
    which is a vector of dimension same as the number of features of each data point,
    *d*). Consequently, it can be said that the input layer has *d* number of nodes.
    Then, there are hidden layers. These are considered the black boxes of the neural
    nets, as whatever happens inside is very difficult to comprehend. There are different
    numbers of hidden layers The number of hidden layers can be changed as per the
    need of the model. Each hidden layer might consist of a different number of nodes.
    The number of hidden layers and number of nodes depends on the various aspects,
    one of which would be computational power. More the layers, the more would the
    need for the computational power. The final layer is the output layer. Depending
    on the type of problem being tackled, the number of nodes can vary. For example,
    for a multi-classification problem, the output layer would have several nodes
    equal to that of the number of classes to be predicted. Each of these layers is
    interconnected to each other through a web-like structure of nodes. Each node
    in the previous layer connects to every node in the next layer. These connections
    are made through the parameterised weight matrix, ![$$W(\theta )$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq58.png)
    where ![$$\theta $$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq59.png)
    is the parameter that is updated to minimize the cost after every iteration of
    a data point. The transition of datapoint from one layer to another simply happens
    through matrix multiplication ![$$W(\theta )\,\cdot \,\mathbf {x}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq60.png).
    Since this transition is based on linear multiplication, to introduce non-linearity,
    which allows the neural network to learn the weights by giving important values
    to become more positive and less relevant points to more negative, non-linear
    layers are added in between the hidden layers. The non-linear layer is nothing
    but an activation function that decides which output value to pass and which not.
    It can be regularised by its parameter called bias. For example, the Eq. ([4](#Equ4)),
    is a famously used non-linear function called the sigmoid function (Fig. [10](#Fig10)).![$$\begin{aligned}

    appropriate methods to encrypt the information. Many have feared that using Quantum
    Computing for cryptographic purposes would break in the encrypted texts but it
    would lead to more possibilities like quantum-resistant cryptographic [[3](#CR3)].
    Currently, there are algorithms regarding Quantum Key Distribution(QKD) like the
    BB84 and B92 protocols. The major difference between these two is the non-requirement
    of 4 polarization states in B92 which is a necessity in the former protocol. The
    details of these QKD protocols will be discussed shortly.

- en: QKD is a process that involves sending encrypted data as classical bits over
    the networks. QKD performs encryption using quantum properties or laws to exchange
    secret information between two parties, such as a secret key. Over a highly insecure
    channel, this secret key or piece of information is used to encrypt codes that
    are being transmitted. QKD provides a way to share information via secret keys
    between a guided channel, from one place to another. The necessity here is that
    this channel has to remain secret, unhackable and encrypted between the two communicating
    parties. Broadly, QKD systems are classified into CV-QKD (Continuous Variable
    QKD) and DV-QKD (Discrete Variable QKD). In CV-QKD systems, the signal ratio decreases
    with subjection to noise as the secret key is generated from the data extracted
    from the transmission of quantum signals across the channel. On the other hand,
    in DV-QKD systems, the secret key generation is extracted from the received quantum
    signal and not from the transmitted quantum signal as per the former system (Fig. [11](#Fig11)).![](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Fig11_HTML.png)

    both encryption and decryption utilising the quantum channel. Briefly, it is just
    a scheme to securely communicate between two parties, using a private key via
    one-time generated pad encryption (Fig. [12](#Fig12)).![](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Fig12_HTML.png)

    which are *k* and *b* respectively, having a length *n*. Now, *k* is termed as
    the actual bits Alice wants to encode and *b* are termed as the bases in which
    *k* will be encoded. The encoding patterns will look like Eqs. ([8](#Equ8))–([11](#Equ11)).![$$\begin{aligned}

- en: B92 protocol is another variant of BB84 protocol that is the utilization of
    polarised photons for transmission of information between Alice and Bob. Unlike
    the BB84 protocol, this algorithm uses non-orthogonal quantum states to encode
    secretly shared information. In B92, only two states are needed rather than four-polarization
    states in BB84\. Alice here chooses the bases of the bits she will transmit to
    Bob, which is not so we learnt in the BB84 section. Bob, though, still chooses
    randomly the basis for measurement of the transmitted information from Alice.
    Now, if the wrong measurement basis is chosen by Bob, then there will be no measurement...
    This condition in quantum terms is defined as erasure. A simple indication of
    the transmitted bits being measured or not can be told to Alice by Bob, following
    this procedure. B92 is less famous than BB84, as the former cannot fully guarantee
    the secure key generation. In the next section, we try to demonstrate the BB84
    protocol using Quantum Python library, “Qiskit”.

- en: The code and the details are provided in the appendix. After understanding the
    role of the helper functions (check appendix) in the code, let’s get back to the
    story of Alice & Bob. Alice wants to share an encrypted message, ![$$c1= '01010000'$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq80.png)
    and ![$$c1= '01001001'$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq81.png)
    with Bob securely and so uses BB84 protocol. According to the protocol discussed
    previously, Alice needs to generate a key string and basis string. She does so
    using the helper function ’key_basis_generation()’. As it can be seen in the appendix
    Fig. [13](#Fig13), she receives ‘00011100’ and ‘0000011’ as her key string and
    basis string. As per the protocol she creates her circuit based on the two strings.
    The first circuit beforer the barrier in Fig. [14](#Fig14), is her circuit. Then
    Bob also receives his basis string which helps him decide on which basis must
    he measure the qubits. For all the bits of the basis string of Bob, which are
    zero, the corresponding wire gets measured in *Z* basis or otherwise in *X* basis.
    Accordingly, with the help of the ‘bob_measurement()’ function Bob can create
    the circuit. The second circuit, on the right side of the barrier, is Bob’s measurement
    plan. Bob uses the circuit and measures the output. He receives ![$$'00111001'$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq82.png)
    as the output string. He then compares the basis string *b* of Alice, the output
    string and his basis string ![$$\tilde{b}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq83.png).
    According to the protocol, if the corresponding bit of their basis string are
    equal, that is, ![$$b_i=\tilde{b}_i$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq84.png),
    then the corresponding bit of the output string is kept otherwise it is discarded.
    So finally, the key Bob gets is ![$$k = 11001$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq85.png).

    (operation is performed in a bitwise manner), where *c* is the cypher message.
    Bob has the key, can decrypt the message by using the formula, ![$$c=m\oplus k$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq87.png)
    and so as Alice sends her encrypted message, ![$$c1 = 01010000$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq88.png)
    and ![$$c2 = 01001001$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq89.png),
    Bob decrypts the message as shown in Eqs. ([12](#Equ12)) and ([13](#Equ13)).![$$\begin{aligned}
    m1=c1 \oplus k=01010000 \oplus 11001=01010000 \end{aligned}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ12.png)(12)![$$\begin{aligned}

    above two decrypted strings when converted to their ASCII equivalent, gives, ‘PI’.That
    means Alice had sent her the message ‘PI’. It must also be noted that IBM uses
    superconducting qubits different from the title of the chapter. IBM’s Quantum
    library ‘Qiskit’ is used merely for the demonstration of the protocol.

    cryptocurrency use a system called the blockchain. Bitcoin is one of the thousands
    of cryptocurrencies that utilizes blockchain technology—the digitalized, decentralized
    national journal. Blockchain is the information system that allows us to create
    transactions and keep data without having to trust the middle person or even the
    person with whom we’re doing business. So blockchain-led change of business and
    government, we think, is still some years off. This is because blockchain is not
    a “disruptive” field, which will move the traditional business model with the
    lower-cost method and overcome current firms rapidly. Blockchain is the foundational
    technology: It has the potential to create new institutions for our system and
    cultural organizations. But while the outcome can be tremendous, it can take decades
    for blockchain to seep into our economic and cultural structure. This process
    of acceptance can be slow and stable, not unexpected, as waves of technical and
    institutional change increase momentum. This understanding and its important implications
    are what we’ll explore in the section. We may define blockchain as the distributed
    number of peer-to-peer transactions composed of interlinked transaction blocks
    in the digital journal. It is a structure with no central authority, where each
    player will store, change and view data without pre-existing belief. Talking of
    access to sensitive information, blockchain protects information through this
    public/private keyway. The blockchain can exist over computer systems that are
    linked through a peer-to-peer network. Although these networks are secure, with
    the advent of quantum computers it becomes important to have a security system
    that can surpass quantum algorithms. Quantum computers can break the classical
    cryptographic protocols. There have been several proposals to make changes in
    blockchains so that it stays protected against quantum attacks. One such proposal
    has been given by kiktenko et al. [[18](#CR18)] which is to secure the blockchains
    by adding a layer of security using QKD networks.'

    to quantum computers, that is, use quantum computers for building blockchains.
    This is known as Quantum Blockchain. One of the approaches to build Quantum Blockchain
    is using Entanglement in time [[39](#CR39)]. It was proposed by Rajan and Visser
    [[37](#CR37)]. This approach uses photonic quantum computing. The method involves
    translating blockchain to the GHZ [[34](#CR34)] state of photons in the temporal
    domain. Equation ([14](#Equ14)) is an example of the GHZ state of three photons
    in a superposition of both vertical and horizontal states.![$$\begin{aligned}
    \left| {GHZ} \right\rangle = \frac{ \left| {HHH} \right\rangle + \left| {VVV}
    \right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}} \end{aligned}$$](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_Equ14.png)(14)This
    idea can be understood by imagining the quantum particle, photon. The information
    is encoded into this photon. When more information is received, the data is encoded
    to the next photon. Since these photons are entangled with each other, tampering
    with the system will destroy the information of the complete quantum blockchain.
    In other words, tampering with a single block of a quantum blockchain of GHZ state
    entangled in time destroys the complete blockchain. Meanwhile, in classical blockchain,
    only the blocks after the one tampered are destroyed which makes the ones before
    insecure. This makes quantum blockchain a promising solution to secure transactions
    and photonic quantum computer can be said as the most promising technology for
    building the quantum blockchain.![](../images/516210_1_En_4_Chapter/516210_1_En_4_Fig13_HTML.png)
