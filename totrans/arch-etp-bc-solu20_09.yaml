- en: Blockchains generally need to have both technical and business merits for an
    enterprise to consider the initial use case for a blockchain solution. In other
    words, the blockchain use case needs to address at least the technical or business
    merits; ideally, however, it will address both. Companies really need to have
    merits that make both business and technical sense and that drive value for the
    company.

    how a blockchain can provide for a consistent solid return of investment (ROI)
    or does that new blockchain application provide a more consistent user experience.
    A company might realize technical benefits but not any tangible business benefits
    such as cost savings. However, this is becoming less of an issue as the evolution
    of blockchain value is properly defined, especially to organizations that are
    reaching end of life on some of their current legacy applications.

- en: As with any new technological innovation, there are challenges to the acceptance
    of the value of blockchain technology to the enterprise and the consumer. These
    challenges can revolve around the technology, costing models, and even human perception.
    For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, we had the war of Betamax (Sony) and VHS
    (JVC). Betamax was superior in many ways, and it became simpler to use with more
    excellent picture quality than VHS. Its tapes were smaller and easier to store.
    You would think that Betamax would have won the war. However, VHS was able to
    extend its recording time to around 4 hours. Consumers preferred recording movies,
    and this was a challenge with Betamax since it could record for about one hour
    due to the length of its tape. Sony did not innovate in time to meet the real
    consumer requirements and did not understand the end consumer, resulting in the
    end of Betamax.

  zh: 与任何新的技术创新一样，区块链技术被企业和消费者接受的价值存在挑战。这些挑战可能围绕技术、成本模型，甚至人们的认知展开。例如，在20世纪70年代和80年代，我们有贝塔克斯（索尼）和VHS（JVC）之战。贝塔克斯在很多方面都更胜一筹，它比VHS的画质更优秀，使用起来更简单。其磁带更小，更容易存放。你会认为贝塔克斯会赢得这场战争。然而，VHS能够将录制时间延长到约4小时。消费者更喜欢录制电影，而这对贝塔克斯来说是一个挑战，因为它只能录制大约一小时的磁带长度。索尼没有及时创新以满足真正的消费者需求，也没有理解最终的消费者，导致贝塔克斯的终结。

- en: I appreciate how companies can view peer-to-peer (P2P) networking negatively
    and want to shut down discussions about it. Centralization is comfortable for

- en: At its truest sense, decentralization is all about trust. Successful blockchains

    could have 10, 20, or even hundreds of microservices. Microservices can aid in
    the development of an application and provide significant cost savings around

- en: Removing manual processes through the implementation of smart contracts provides
    clear efficiencies around costing models, error rates, and the processing speed
    of a transaction. For example, if your bank once had transactions, such as a wire

    type of process would be a great target for a smart contract to provide value
    and, therefore, a possible use case.
