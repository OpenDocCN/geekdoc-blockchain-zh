    use cases that can provide value to not only the organization but also their suppliers,
    customers, and partners. I will touch on just a few of the use cases that have
    been announced, although new announcements are made every day.

    enterprise to consider the initial use case for a blockchain solution. In other
    words, the blockchain use case needs to address at least the technical or business
    merits; ideally, however, it will address both. Companies really need to have
    merits that make both business and technical sense and that drive value for the
    company.

    technologies. Generally, companies that are behind on initiating innovation can
    derive value from an innovation easier.

    how a blockchain can provide for a consistent solid return of investment (ROI)
    or does that new blockchain application provide a more consistent user experience.
    A company might realize technical benefits but not any tangible business benefits
    such as cost savings. However, this is becoming less of an issue as the evolution
    of blockchain value is properly defined, especially to organizations that are
    reaching end of life on some of their current legacy applications.

    Merits of Blockchain Acceptance'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with any new technological innovation, there are challenges to the acceptance
    of the value of blockchain technology to the enterprise and the consumer. These
    challenges can revolve around the technology, costing models, and even human perception.
    For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, we had the war of Betamax (Sony) and VHS
    (JVC). Betamax was superior in many ways, and it became simpler to use with more
    excellent picture quality than VHS. Its tapes were smaller and easier to store.
    You would think that Betamax would have won the war. However, VHS was able to
    extend its recording time to around 4 hours. Consumers preferred recording movies,
    and this was a challenge with Betamax since it could record for about one hour
    due to the length of its tape. Sony did not innovate in time to meet the real
    consumer requirements and did not understand the end consumer, resulting in the
    end of Betamax.

    the implementation of smart contracts. These technical merits are generally accepted

    They are, for the most part, built from a molding of three existing technologies

    results in numerous other benefits.

    each technology could be applied at a high level. For example, encryption is used
    to ensure that your message data is sent securely from the sender to the receiver
    in such a manner that it cannot be read by anyone other than the receiver. Privacy,
    security, and confidentiality could all be achieved.

    and want to shut down discussions about it. Centralization is comfortable for
    companies since they're in the driver's seat. With decentralization, companies
    are effectively in the passenger seat regarding control and governance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    work in a manner of true consortium with a shared responsibility model. A shared
    responsibility model is where all the consortium members collaborate and contribute
    finances and labor.

    aka computer code. Essentially, either we receive a positive result or the smart
    contract (code) does not execute the proposal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smart contracts provide the greatest benefits when there is an intermediary
    process that was once a manual process that now can be removed. Smart contracts
    are not complex. There are containers in most blockchains with limited functions
    that could be executed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to describe a smart contract is as a microservice. A microservice
    contrasts to a traditional, monolithic application, which, from a software development
    perspective, is designed and built as one integrated application. An application
    could have 10, 20, or even hundreds of microservices. Microservices can aid in
    the development of an application and provide significant cost savings around
    manual processes. Smart contracts are microservices, and microservice, which can
    be combined to create a distributed application.

    clear efficiencies around costing models, error rates, and the processing speed
    of a transaction. For example, if your bank once had transactions, such as a wire
    transfer, that would take hours or even a day to be executed and confirmed, this
    type of process would be a great target for a smart contract to provide value
    and, therefore, a possible use case.

    historical record, for example, of a mining operation and for its material purchases
    the ability to validate when a specific lot of gold, diamonds, or other commodities

    that is gaining a significant amount of interest. The convergence of blockchain
    and IoT has been prioritized by the blockchain industry as one of the most promising

    can be tracked and analyzed by any party authorized to connect to the network.

    immutability but for data standardization. For example, a blockchain platform
    called *IOTA* is a decentralized transactional platform on various development
    projects. IOTA's Tangle is a transactional data transfer and settlement system
    for connected devices. These connected devices could be connected and validated
    to a decentralized ledger.

    Farm to Table'

    in the agriculture sector. Farms are generally slow to invest and adapt to technology,
    and record keeping is not a consistent process. Blockchains could resolve a significant
    issue around recording where a product came from, where it is in the supply chain,
    and when it will arrive at its destination. A significant number of blockchain-focused
    agricultural solutions focus on improving food source traceability as well as
    accountability.
  prefs: []

    and food suppliers. There is clearly a need for a more transparent producer-to-consumer
    system.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    traceability. This would enable a true use case of transparency for a food chain
    entirely verified by the consortium members. For example, if there were a concern
    around food safety, then all parties involved would have clear transparency, provenance,
    and even the ability to address other concerns through a blockchain-based implementation
    of a farm-to-table solution.

    trust, and provenance. Enabling blockchains can provide significant advantages
    to stakeholders, including real-time access, trusted data, and peer-to-peer networking.
    When blockchain is combined with IoT, the benefits can easily be realized during
    the logistics processes. For example, some benefits could be that farmers are
    paid more quickly traceability is immediate, insurance claims could be processed
    faster and so on.

    Healthcare Use Cases'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Healthcare can be complex and challenging with compliance issues such as having
    to meet strict privacy data requirements. Patient data is generally held across
    multiple different institutions which have been traditionally in a legacy application
    silo. This means that the health network is closed and not well integrated with
    open systems. The historical use of different standards poses challenges for interoperability
    and sharing of medical data effectively.
  prefs: []

    256 or ECC can facilitate compliance around a more secure approach to patient

    for mishandling patient data—not just in fines but in company image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    by blockchain is Medicalchain. Medicalchain uses blockchain technology to securely
    store patient health records. Medicalchain maintains a single version of what

    truth is maintained on a blockchain ledger, and participating health organizations
    can request permission to access medical records.
