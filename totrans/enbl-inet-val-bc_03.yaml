    combined with high-level automation. The common share traded publicly on a traditional

    generation, classical blockchain and thus most cryptocurrencies, established a

    “truth” about how many coins are held by each address. The second generation introduced
    smart contracts and DAOs through *consensus about procedure*. Effectively, this
    began with Ethereum endowing all nodes with a common Turing-complete programming
    language. This generation allows smart contracts to be combined to create entire
    virtual organisations devoid of humans. Limitations of foresight that materialised
    in this generation (“The DAO”) spurred the third generation, engineering a decentralised
    *consensus on agency*. Within this third generation, the governance structure

- en: Although first-generation blockchains effectively provided a shared ledger of

    stipulations. Ethereum (Buterin [2014](#CR2)) was the first to offer, with its
    Solidity, a Turing-complete programming language for code, which will be executed
    by all the nodes in the network on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Effectively,
    this provides a method to write programs which then run on other people’s computers
    without leaving to their discretion the integrity of execution. The distributed
    nature of the network ensures multiple independent verifications of the calculation,
    and the consensus algorithm ensures no single entity controls what is considered
    the output of the execution. Consensus based on procedure ultimately introduces
    “an un-ownable computer”, programmable and usable by anyone. Many business models
    have sprung from this, most fundamentally in competition as an alternative DLT
    solution, but far more commonly in developing smart contracts and decentralised
    applications running on a major established platform such as Ethereum, Hyperledger,

    What has been flippantly called “attaching a banknote to an e-mail” has revolutionised
    more than just payment systems. DLT has not only allowed decentralised systems
    to reach consensus on potentially controversial states of nature, but has evolved
    to engineer consensus about procedures (with smart contracts and ultimately DAOs)
    and even agency (enabling governance structures that we have only marginally started
    to utilise; see Chapter “Governance and Privacy Issues from the Internet of Value”).

    despite the conceptual difficulty of DLT and certain inherent inefficiencies limiting
    its applicability, many more non-financial business cases are becoming visible.
    Regardless of the current state of the volatile cryptocurrency prices, a factor

  zh: 摘要
- en: The Internet of Value (IoV) with its distributed ledger technology (DLT) underpinning
    has created new forms of lending markets. As an integral part of the decentralised
    finance (DeFi) ecosystem, lending protocols are gaining tremendous traction, holding
    an aggregate liquidity supply of over $40 billion at the time of writing. In this
    paper, we enumerate the challenges of traditional money markets led by banks and
    lending platforms and present advantageous characteristics of DeFi lending protocols
    that might help resolve deep-rooted issues in the conventional lending environment.
    With the examples of Maker, Compound and Aave, we describe in detail the mechanism
    of DeFi lending protocols. We discuss the persisting reliance of DeFi lending
    on the traditional financial system and conclude with the outlook of the lending
    market in the IoV era.

    of years, with the first evidence of loans in human history taking place in Mesopotamia
    approximately 5,000 years ago (Freas [2018](#CR6)). Since then, lending markets
    have evolved to assume many different forms including consumer lending, student
    loans, mortgages, corporate debt and government bonds.

- en: Fundamentally, lending is intricately related to the concept of trust and the
    promise of repayment. The act of lending is to lend money, to earn interest, and
    to be paid back. The term “credit” itself comes from the mid-sixteenth century
    French, meaning to believe and trust.

- en: In the lending market, banks hold a unique position as that of a “money creator”
    (Werner [2014](#CR21)). When providing a loan, a bank simultaneously extends its
    balance sheet by increasing its assets (loans receivable) and its liability (borrower’s
    deposit) (Lindner [2013](#CR10)). The amount that commercial banks can lend is
    not as simple as a multiplier effect of the reserves they hold at the central
    bank; instead, it depends on various factors to do with market forces, risk, interest
    rates, borrower behaviour and regulatory policy. The majority of broad money in
    economies (with particular reference to the UK) are bank deposits, accounting
    for 97% of the total amount of money in circulation, created via loans (McLeay
    et al. [2014](#CR12)). Let us look at central banks and commercial banks in more
    detail below.

  zh: 在贷款市场中，银行拥有独特地位，充当“货币创造者”（Werner [2014](#CR21)）。在提供贷款时，银行同时通过增加其资产（应收贷款）和负债（借款人的存款）来扩展其资产负债表（Lindner
    [2013](#CR10)）。商业银行能提供的贷款额度并不像其在中央银行持有的准备金那样简单的乘数效应；相反，它取决于与市场力量、风险、利率、借款人行为和监管政策有关的众多因素。经济体中大部分流通货币（特别参考英国）是银行存款，占流通总货币的97%，是通过贷款创造的（McLeay
    et al. [2014](#CR12)）。让我们在下文更详细地了解一下中央银行和商业银行。
- en: '**Central banks** A new loan issued by a central bank can increase the central
    bank’s outstanding money supply. Thus, a central bank is the “lender of last resort”
    as it is technically capable of issuing large-scale loans commonly used as a rescue
    plan to “bail out” commercial banks in a financial crisis. This practice has been
    occasionally employed since the global financial crisis of 2007–2009 in the form
    of Quantitative Easing (QE), where central bank reserves are created to purchase
    financial assets, mainly from non-bank financial companies (McLeay et al. [2014](#CR12)).
    Naturally, a central bank’s excessive loan issuance inflates monetary supply,
    which potentially leads to currency depreciation. Bailout plans of this sort–where
    central banks “print” fresh money to ensure market liquidity–have historically
    received criticism as the action dilutes the money’s value.'

  zh: '**中央银行** 中央银行新发行的贷款可以增加中央银行的流通货币供应量。因此，中央银行是“最后贷款人”，因为从技术上讲，它有能力发行大规模贷款，通常用作救助计划，以“救助”商业银行在金融危机中。自2007-2009年全球金融危机以来，这种做法偶尔被采用，即量化宽松（QE），中央银行储备被创造出来购买金融资产，主要来自非银行金融机构（McLeay
    et al. [2014](#CR12)）。自然地，中央银行过度的贷款发行会导致货币供应膨胀，这可能导致货币贬值。这种救助计划——中央银行“印刷”新钱以确保市场流动性——历史上一直受到批评，因为这种行动会稀释货币的价值。'
- en: '**Commercial banks** For commercial banks, newly created deposits through loan
    issuance can also be used as money in the sense that they can be accepted as a
    form of payment by non-banks. In effect, a deposit at a commercial bank represents
    the bank’s promise to pay central bank money. Failure to collect a sufficient
    amount of outstanding loans as a result of, e.g. borrowers not being able to repay,
    thus induces a breach of promise on the part of the commercial bank, potentially
    resulting in bankruptcy and, more severely, mistrust in the overall banking system.
    This was precisely the story of the global financial crisis, where banks collapsed
    due to the high rate of default in the secondary mortgage market.'

  zh: '**商业银行** 对商业银行来说，通过贷款发行创建的新存款也可以作为货币使用，因为它们可以被非银行机构接受作为一种支付形式。实际上，商业银行的存款代表了银行承诺支付中央银行货币的承诺。例如，由于借款人无法偿还，未能收回足够的未偿还贷款，从而使商业银行违反了承诺，可能导致破产，更严重的是，可能对整个银行系统产生不信任。这正是全球金融危机的故事，银行因次级抵押贷款市场的高违约率而崩溃。'

    commercial banks: issuing a loan by creating a new deposit in the form of “promise
    to pay central bank money”, in which case, deposits would not need to fully cover
    loans. Critically, however, the “promise” from lending companies—unlike commercial
    banks—cannot be used as legal tender. Consequently, borrowers would find it difficult

    both lenders and borrowers at the same time. Lenders on these types of platforms
    can be either institutional wealth managers or retail investors, as seen on UK-based
    [Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com/global/capitalmarkets/) and US-based
    [LendingClub](https://help.lendingclub.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009000328-How-LendingClub-balances-different-investors-on-its-platform).
    The market trend has been that more and more institutional funding is being drawn
    to these platforms, and preferred by the platforms due to the economies of scale
    when dealing with larger investors (Ziegler et al. [2020](#CR25)). The borrowers
    are often individuals or small and medium enterprises, who apply for a loan by
    supplying relevant information such as loan principal required, borrowing period
    and credit history. While acting as an agent without taking any credit risk, a
    lending platform usually performs some degree of risk assessment of borrowers
    based on their profile to ensure the minimum quality of listed loans.^([1](#Fn1))
    Rather than linking individual quotes from lenders and borrowers, most platforms
    nowadays pull funds and manage a diverse set of borrowers to better diversify
    risks for their pool of investors. Loans are fractionalised such that lenders
    can invest in a large number of these smaller loan chunks to reduce idiosyncratic
    risks, and can achieve exposure based on their risk appetite.'

    for the borrower’s particular request and credibility. The request is subsequently
    posted on the platform where lenders can choose to fulfil individual requests.
    Peer-to-peer lending platforms, such as the China-based [PPDai](https://invest.ppdai.com/loan/listpage),

    not been efficiently passing them along (Barrett et al. [2020](#CR1)). The passthrough
    of changes in the interest rates were also delayed, resulting in a high lending
    rate in a low savings interest environment, which is detrimental to borrowers.

- en: Maker protocol revolves around DAI, a stablecoin whose value is soft-pegged
    to the US dollar. Users who wish to borrow DAI must first lock collateral in a
    smart contract named the Maker collateral vault. The collateral can be ETH (the
    native coin on Ethereum) or certain ERC-20 tokens (digital assets on Ethereum).
    The collateral can constitute one single asset or multiple assets. The smart contract
    calculates the collateral value based on its quantity and its market price, where
    the market price is input through an oracle, i.e. an external data feed provider.
    The borrower can then request the smart contract to issue him some DAI amount
    below a predetermined threshold fraction of the collateral value. This threshold
    fraction determines when the collateral will liquidate. Borrowers are thus advised
    to request the issuing amount of DAI to be moderately below the threshold, such
    that the slight downward price movement of the collateral against DAI will not
    render the collateral available for liquidation.

- en: There is no margin call with the Marker protocol. It is the borrower’s responsibility
    to keep the borrow position overcollateralised by topping up collateral or repaying
    DAI in case of unfavourable price change. As soon as a borrower’s loan-to-value
    ratio exceeds the liquidation threshold, any network participant is entitled to
    bid for the collateral by repaying part of the loan, thus liquidating the position.

    loan and the loan interest, termed the “stability fee”. The stability fee accrues
    over time. Its value is dynamically adjusted. When the stability fee is high,
    the borrower is incentivised to pay back some DAI, which is subsequently burned
    by the smart contract. Thus, this stability fee serves as a mechanism to steer
    the circulating supply of DAI, ensuring that the currency value does not deviate
    too much from its peg. There is no fixed loan period; DAI can be repaid partially
    or entirely at any time.

    will receive some cToken (e.g. cETH, cDAI) of an equivalent value, which can be
    used in exchange for the deposited asset plus interest in the future. A cToken
    is an interest-bearing token, whose exchange rate against the deposited asset
    increases over time (Leshner and Hayes [2019](#CR9)).

    on the amount deposited and locked, as well as the amount borrowed.

    maximum amount of funds that the user can borrow against his collateral. The market
    value of assets is determined through the protocol’s price oracle. As both borrowed
    assets and collateralised assets experience price movements and accrue interest,
    the collateralisation ratio of a borrower’s position changes continuously. Despite
    the absence of a fixed loan term, the borrower needs to ensure the overcollateralisation
    of his borrow position, such that the collateral does not become available to
    be liquidated by other network participants.

    pegged to the deposited asset. For example, if a user deposits 12 ETH, they will
    receive 12 aETH as proof of deposit. The balance of aETH automatically increases
    over time, mirroring the interest payment against the ETH deposit (Aave [2020](#CR23)).
    aToken holders can always redeem the underlying asset with a 1:1 exchange rate
    by sending aToken to the smart contract and receiving an equivalent amount of
    the underlying asset from the smart contract.

    security requirements for protocols are exceptionally high. Unfortunately, there
    persist vulnerabilities and loopholes in smart contracts which attackers—rightfully
    albeit not righteously—exploit and profit from (Qin et al. [2021](#CR17)). In
    particular, malicious users are seen to abuse certain features of DeFi lending
    protocols to perform, e.g. flash-loans-funded price oracle attacks (Xu et al.
    [2022](#CR24)). The pseudonymous nature of blockchain, plus the absence of central
    authority, makes it challenging for attack victims to claim damage. As it stands,
    the community still resorts to regulations to deter malicious activities. In the
    long run, an improved protocol governance will lead to system resilience and a
    dependence on law enforcement external to the decentralised ecosystem will be
    reduced.

    majority of these companies, reflected in the bottom-left part of Fig. [1](#Fig1),
    are yet to make a profit. While many have floated on international stock exchanges,
    their share prices have tumbled since their Initial Public Offerings (Sanborn
    [2019](#CR18)). Their problem has not only been the high costs of funding versus
    the incumbent commercial banks. Their technology advantage and abandonment of
    legacy infrastructure have not sufficed to outplay the competition. Furthermore,
    consolidation is occurring in the traditional part of the sector (Megaw [2020](#CR13)).
    Commercial banks are buying marketplace lenders who are in trouble and combining
    the latter’s technological advantage with their own lower funding costs. Hopefully,
    this can only be good news for borrowers.

    greater than that of equities and debt securities and valued at over $250 trillion
    (Barnes [2018](#CR3)). Out of the global real estate market, residential real
    estate accounts for the largest share at approximately 80%. Although enormous
    in size, the impact of technology in general in the real estate sector has been
    limited. The main act of purchase and sale is still a predominantly manual and
    paper-based process. Land Registries have a limited degree of digitisation, and

    opacity and general slow turn-around times.

    designed to make buying and selling a property more straightforward, quicker and
    cheaper through the innovative use of technology. The first trial of this approach
    for partial completion of the exchange process took place in March 2019 and forms
    part of the HMLR *Digital Streets* project. Finally, we conclude the chapter by
    discussing some of the strategic questions that require consideration before the
    technologies gain wider market adoption.

    methodology or technology used to facilitate this information exchange may have
    advantages, not only to individual parties in terms of efficiency and cost savings
    but also to the entire market. For example, sharing information between parties
    to speed up transactions might enable the markets to clear faster, leading to
    higher volumes or more efficient price discovery. Alternatively, sharing data
    more efficiently between parties or aggregating it in new ways may facilitate
    the creation of new measures of counter-party risk and allow market participants
    to benefit from this new information (Stiglitz [2000](#CR12)). Some of these considerations

- en: Building Information Management (BIM) is utilised to track the various parts
    of a building as they are being constructed. BIM not only ensures that components
    are going in the right places but provides information on maintenance issues that
    may arise once the building is built. The utilisation of DLT here as a tool to
    track and audit the various parts of a building as it is being constructed can
    ensure a better reconciliation trail for any changes that are made to the model.
    Linking the various components of a building from their source to where they are
    utilised in the construction process provides a wealth of information ensuring
    the provenance of materials and parts of a building. Placing this information
    onto a DLT with clear governance and audit protocols allows for easy verification
    that a building has been constructed as expected and that various components have
    been checked, fitted and maintained as the design intended. Linking this information
    to the property title ensures that historical information is carried throughout
    the life cycle of the property. The utilisation of IoT sensors can facilitate
    automatic processes updating various features of a build. For example, one could
    use sensors to measure that building components have been maintained on time.
    Currently, BIM processes are seldom linked to asset registries and often are siloed
    away from other property information. A DLT system can help to ensure a common
    store of information for each property.

    to destination is often susceptible to human error, omission or at worse a laborious
    audit process. Indeed, it isn’t easy in most supply chains to know for certain
    where goods are at any time. This is especially important for goods that have
    certain properties, such as temperature sensitivity. DLT utilised along a supply
    chain can ensure a single view of how components and supplies have moved from
    their source to their destination. Furthermore, the implementation of IoT sensors
    can help automate record-keeping processes. Smart contract technology can also
    be utilised for speeding up payments along a supply chain once contracted players
    complete obligations.

    architecture, BIM and relevant supply chain information at the point of creating
    the title deed. Integration of various stakeholders in creating a title with HMLR
    would ensure a higher degree of data integrity for a property, making it increasingly
    useful when this information is required for property due diligence. A good example
    of this is the solution being developed by Lantmateriet, the Swedish land authority,
    which uses a digital blockchain-based solution to store digitised contracts for

    or held by agents can be frequently inaccurate and lack standardisation. Furthermore,
    data about properties can be fragmented across several different platforms. The
    utilisation of DLT can directly link property information to its title, including
    all the relevant information on the building construction, maintenance and historical
    performance. Creating a distributed infrastructure would ensure that information
    is shared and accessible by various stakeholders and ensure more reliable information
    is available to all at a cheaper price point. This would reduce the cost of search
    and acquisition of real estate assets.

    to be consolidated and attached to a distributed asset registry, this information

    and financial evaluation processes. For instance, granting access to property
    information on an asset registry during a transaction due diligence process or
    when a financial loan is considered would enable these processes to be sped up
    significantly, and result in more transparency and fewer errors. An example of
    this is from the Bank of China which utilises a private blockchain to process
    85% of all real estate appraisals in financial evaluation processes (Antonovici

- en: Real estate investing has historically been a non-fungible asset class. This
    has traditionally meant that one requires a lump sum of capital and a loan for
    the property’s remaining portion. This creates a barrier to entry for those seeking
    to augment their portfolios with specific assets and exposure. There are also
    many intermediaries involved in a transaction that increase the costs associated
    with transactions. Portfolio investment is also available but is often confined
    to the commercial real estate domain, and portfolios are not specific or geographically
    specific. International real estate transactions in this domain are also challenging
    to facilitate. In short, for the average investor, it is hard to invest in a diversified
    real estate portfolio or specific assets. Tokenisation of real estate could be
    achieved by making real estate investments fungible. Utilising a token mechanism,
    or the concept of a digital share of a property that DLT underpins, would enable
    entities to trade parts of a property and create dynamic portfolios. This would
    also disintermediate many of the intermediaries involved with the real estate
    process as direct ownership of assets could be completed and logged on an asset
    registry, whereby all relevant information regarding a property would be available.
    In many respects, DLT enables an efficient mechanism to facilitate the transfer
    and clearing of real estate as a fungible asset, ultimately increasing asset utilisation.
    Smart contracts can also facilitate automatic payments and pass-through of income
    on property assets as well as provide voting facilities for any decisions that
    must be made regarding property maintenance. All of this must be supported by
    correct regulatory guidance as property investment in a fungible way is a regulated
    financial investment activity. There are several projects involved with tokenising
    real estate that includes Fluidity^([3](#Fn3)) and Consensys.^([4](#Fn4))

    would enable transparency, error reduction, reduced fraud and efficient transfer
    of assets between stakeholders. Land registries are digitised in some countries
    (not on DLT infrastructure); however, land titles are still paper-based in many
    countries (including the US). The utilisation of paper-based processes ultimately
    increases the scope for errors in title information, time for cross-validation
    of information and access to this same information. Once titles are placed on
    to a DLT, further relevant information regarding that property can be appended
    to it. Decentralising the asset registry to all the stakeholders involved in dealing
    with titles would enable lower-cost access and more transparent and higher integrity
    of information. Smart contracts could also be linked to the title to allow automatic
    processes to be enacted. This would enable asset transfer for buyers and sellers,
    verifying a transfer process or automated enforcement of certain conditions on
    loan payments on the property.

    payment information or tenant rental payments, which can serve as reputational
    and credit enhancement for various records for financial evaluation or due diligence.
    When considering cross-border payments, utilising certain token-based payment
    rails could be a way to streamline and reduce the cost of international payments
    when used in real estate transactions.

- en: Conveyancing is the transfer of a legal title of real estate from one person
    or organisation to another. This also includes the granting of an encumbrance
    such as a mortgage or a lien. Typically there are two major phases to a conveyancing
    transaction. The first is the exchange of contracts (when equitable interests
    are created), and the second is completion (also called settlement, when legal
    title passes and equitable rights merge with the legal title). In England and
    Wales, conveyancing is usually done by a solicitor or a licensed conveyancer (it
    does not have to be, but is quite a labour intensive). If the transaction involves
    a mortgage, it’s almost certain that the lender will insist that a solicitor is
    used for the conveyancing. Under English law, agreements are not legally binding
    until contracts are exchanged. This affords both the advantage of freedom before
    completion and the disadvantage of wasted time and expense in the event the deal
    does not complete.

    interactions with various counter-parties, can be seen in Fig. [1](#Fig1). The
    normal practice is for the buyer to negotiate an agreed price with the seller,
    organise a survey and have the solicitor (or conveyancer) carry out their searches
    and pre-contract enquiries. The seller’s solicitor or conveyancer will prepare
    the draft contract to be approved by the buyer’s solicitor. The seller’s solicitor
    will also collect and prepare property information to be provided to the buyer’s
    solicitors, in line with the Law Society’s National Protocol for domestic conveyancing.
    When undertaking property transactions, the conveyancer’s role is to carry out
    due diligence by submitting queries—known as Conveyancing Searches—about the transacted
    property. These are designed to uncover factors the estate agent or surveyor may
    not know about, which could impact the buyer’s enjoyment of the property. It takes
    on average 10–12 weeks to complete a conveyancing transaction, but while some
    transactions are quicker, many take longer. The timescale is determined by a host
    of factors: legal, personal, social and financial. During this period before the
    exchange of contracts (exchange being the point at which the transaction becomes
    legally binding), either party can pull out of the transaction at any time and
    for any reason, with no legal obligation to the other. This gives rise to a risk
    of gazumping and its converse, gazundering. Conveyancing is a component of the
    cost of moving home in the United Kingdom.'

- en: As it stands currently, there are several problems with the conveyancing process.
    Conveyancing is labour-intensive and full of redundancy and duplication of effort.
    This results in a lengthy time for transactions to be processed and makes the
    process error-prone. In today’s environment, where property transactions are often
    chain-dependent, errors in conveyancing in different parts of the transaction
    chain can compound delays. These delays are the result of several reasons, primarily
    around disparate technologies being utilised by the different stakeholders in
    the conveyancing process and little transparency in the process for both sides
    at any one time. In particular, at the points of exchange and competition, there
    is no way to verify what has occurred and understand where delays are in the chain.
    Both the buyer and the seller have their conveyancers and are siloed in the transaction
    process. There is no single point of truth to refer to with regards to the transaction
    process. Previous attempts to create solutions to address this have not been successful
    due to having to create replicating processes for all stakeholders.

    Yoti, Natwest, My Home Move and HMRC. Before moving on, several of the participants
    mentioned above summarise what they see as the biggest problems with existing
    processes and infrastructure in conveyancing. Nick West, Chief Strategy Officer,
    Mishcon de Reya,^([5](#Fn5)) states that the technologies and systems currently
    used are disparate. Legacy systems cause delays in transaction times. Currently,
    there is no way for a seller or buyer to independently verify if exchange or completion
    has taken place or to understand where a delay is being caused in a chain. A number
    of the processes are undertaken manually, which makes transactions slow, time-consuming
    and frustrating.

    the biggest pain points in the property transaction process is the mix of methodologies
    used to identify and engage with buyers and sellers across each organisation that
    services the transaction. Estate agents, mortgage lenders, and conveyancing solicitors
    must identify the participants in a property transaction formally, yet their customers
    need to go through multiple identity verification processes to achieve this. Some
    of these processes involve insecure and easily defrauded practices such as posting
    documents, emailing document images and in-person document checks by untrained
    staff.

    interoperability and sharing of data between systems is one of the biggest problems
    with conveyancing today. Each law firm, lender, estate agent, insurer, search
    provider, HM Revenue and Customs, and HMLR all have different systems that are
    not interconnected or interconnectable. To a certain extent, APIs are available,
    but this happens in silos on each side of the transaction. The Buy-side lawyer
    may well have excellent connections to the relevant stakeholders via API but no
    connection to what is happening on the Sell-side. There is no central point that
    allows all parties to a transaction to see the transaction’s progress. Others
    have previously made attempts to join up the parties of property transactions
    on a single system, but these types of systems were not/have not been widely adopted
    because each party is required to re-enter information they have into a further
    system, and it requires buy-in from all stakeholders to be taken up.

    significant pain points in the current buying and selling process. Buyers and
    sellers commonly complain that they don’t know where they are in the process,
    while much of conveyancers’ time is spent providing updates to their clients.
    ID checks can also take a long time and are often performed multiple times throughout
    the process.![../images/508554_1_En_7_Chapter/508554_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/508554_1_En_7_Chapter/508554_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.png)

    the next 12 months, a DLT-based transaction will take place; whether that is entirely
    end to end or will still require certain legacy processes to complete registrations
    remains to be seen. Seeing wide adoption of such DLT systems stems partially from
    the need for HMLR to have the ability to service this (3–4 years) and for there
    to be a critical mass of law firms and lenders willing to participate (3–4 years).
    The barriers to adoption will be the resistance to change from key stakeholders,
    particularly from law firms and lenders. There will also need to be common standards
    and reliance on identity verification of underlying customers as well as actors
    on the DLT.

    adopt and agree on a system’s parameters. In a market where stakeholders are working
    together to facilitate processes for their mutual benefit, this is fine. But in
    a market where natural competitors must come together to share information on
    a common data level, “for example, brokers”, then there occurs a paradox on how
    natural competitors should start to cooperate. There are two possible solutions
    to this, with one of particular relevance to the real estate sector. The first
    is that in the face of impending disintermediation, competitors realise that they
    can reduce the costs of information asymmetry by working together. In this scenario,
    although unit costs would decrease, the business volume would increase as asset
    utilisation increases. The second is that where there is a strong influencer who
    can essentially dictate to other stakeholders what they should be doing, for instance,
    HMLR, this can lead to the stakeholders in the ecosystem adopting a particular
    version of the technology.

    layer of the Internet. As the Internet transformed how individuals and businesses
    communicated, blockchain seeks to change how information is verified, and networks
    are created. In the context of real estate, these two factors are vitally important.
    Recording information related to a building’s facilities, maintenance and a tenant’s
    rent and attaching that information to the building’s title itself is an example
    of what can be achieved with better information verification. Along with this
    comes the benefits of reducing costs, more efficient processes and enriched data
    paving the way for new business models to be applied. Consider the example of
    the conveyancing proof of concept discussed earlier—what would be possible once
    the purchase and sale of a building went from weeks and months to mere minutes?
    The possibilities are not currently known—but surely there will be many!

    Real estate is often considered an asset class out of the reach of many with significant
    barriers to entry, particularly for the young. The potential for tokenising real
    estate assets and enabling direct fractional participation rather than entirely
    owning gives a chance to many excluded from this market to access its returns.
    Moreover, the possibilities once again to think of new shared ownership, partial
    ownership and real estate access business models are endless.
  id: totrans-326

- en: Ultimately, as the largest asset class globally, real estate has surprisingly
    not seen the digital transformation in many other industries. Blockchain, along
    with many other emerging technologies, is making its mark on this sector right
    now. How quickly more than incremental shifts in the industry occur is dependent
    on how many existing participants will accept this new technology and where regulation
    will adapt to it. With the likes of HMLR and many other Land Registries around
    the world experimenting, it should be a case of when, and not if and sooner rather
    than later.
