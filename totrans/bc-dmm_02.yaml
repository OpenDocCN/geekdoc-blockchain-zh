    ledger of data and share it among a network of independent parties. There are
    many different types of blockchains.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Public blockchains:** Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin, are large distributed
    networks that are run through a native token. They’re open for anyone to participate
    at any level and have open-source code that their community maintains.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Permissioned blockchains:** Permissioned blockchains, such as Ripple, control
    roles that individuals can play within the network. They’re still large and distributed
    systems that use a native token. Their core code may or may not be open source.'

    utilize a token. Their membership is closely controlled. These types of blockchains
    are favored by consortiums that have trusted members and trade confidential information.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All three types of blockchains use cryptography to allow each participant on
    any given network to manage the ledger in a secure way without the need for a
    central authority to enforce the rules. The removal of central authority from
    database structure is one of the most important and powerful aspects of blockchains.

- en: '![remember](images/remember.png) Blockchains create permanent records and histories
    of transactions, but nothing is really permanent. The permanence of the record
    is based on the permanence of the network. In the context of blockchains, this
    means that a large portion of a blockchain community would all have to agree to
    change the information and are incentivized *not* to change the data.'

    remove it. When someone wants to add a record to a blockchain, also called a *transaction*
    or an *entry,* users in the network who have validation control verify the proposed
    transaction. This is where things get tricky because every blockchain has a slightly
    different spin on how this should work and who can validate a transaction.

- en: A blockchain is a peer-to-peer system with no central authority managing data
    flow. One of the key ways to removing central control while maintaining data integrity
    is to have a large distributed network of independent users. This means that the
    computers that make up the network are in more than one location. These computers
    are often referred to as *full nodes.*

    but they often also utilize a cryptocurrency. A *cryptocurrency* is a digital
    token that has a market value. Cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges like stocks.

    the software pays the hardware to operate. The software is the blockchain protocol.
    Well-known blockchain protocols include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Hyperledger,
    and Factom. The hardware consists of the full nodes that are securing the data
    in the network.  ### Why blockchains matter'

    into a blockchain database, it’s nearly impossible to remove or change it. This
    capability has never existed before.

    online in ways that, in the past, were only possible offline. Everything that
    has stayed analog, including property rights and identity, can now be created
    and maintained online. Slow business and banking processes, such as money wires
    and fund settlements, can now be done nearly instantaneously. The implications
    for secure digital records are enormous for the global economy.

    value transfer that blockchains enable through the trading of their native tokens.

    cryptocurrency as their primary objective. But all blockchain do record the movement
    of their cryptocurrency or token. Think of the *transaction* as simply being the

    is used to interpret what that data means.

    them together. This is one of the most difficult concepts in blockchain to comprehend.

    mathematical trust.'

    new innovation, hashing is not. Hashing was invented over 30 years ago. This old
    innovation is being used because it creates a one-way function that cannot be
    decrypted. A hashing function creates a mathematical algorithm that maps data
    of any size to a bit string of a fixed size. A bit string is usually 32 characters
    long, which then represents the data that was hashed. The Secure Hash Algorithm
    (SHA) is one of some cryptographic hash functions used in blockchains. SHA-256
    is a common algorithm that generates an almost-unique, fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte)
    hash. For practical purposes, think of a hash as a digital fingerprint of data
    that is used to lock it in place within the blockchain.'

    difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to operate a full node, so people don’t

    cryptocurrency. The underlying blockchain algorithm rewards them for their service.

    It has around 5,000 full nodes and is globally distributed. It’s primarily used
    to trade Bitcoin and exchange value, but the community saw the potential of doing
    a lot more with the network. Because of its size and time-tested security, it’s
    also being used to secure other smaller blockchains and blockchain applications.

    the traditional blockchain structure and adds a programming language that is built
    inside of it. Like Bitcoin, it has over 5,000 full nodes and is globally distributed.
    Ethereum is primarily used to trade Ether, make smart contracts, and create decentralized
    autonomous organizations (DAOs). It’s also being used to secure blockchain applications
    and smaller blockchains.

    a lighter consensus system, incorporates voting, and stores a lot more information.
    It was built primarily to secure data and system. Factom operates with federated
    nodes and an unlimited number of auditing nodes. Its network is small, so it anchors
    itself into other distributed networks building bridges across the carries blockchains.  ##

    among a group of commonly mistrusting shareholders. These are the full nodes on

    on the entries being added. There are many different models for creating consensus
    because each blockchain is creating different kinds of entries. Some blockchains
    are trading value, others are storing data, and others are securing systems and
    contracts.

    its network. The tokens have a market value, so the requirements related to performance,
    scalability, consistency, threat model, and failure model will be higher. Bitcoin
    operates under the assumption that a malicious attacker may want to corrupt the
    history of trades in order to steal tokens. Bitcoin prevents this from happening
    by using a consensus model called “proof of work” that solves the Byzantine general’s
    problem: “How do you know that the information you are looking at has not been
    changed internally or externally?” Because changing or manipulating data is almost
    always possible, the reliability of data is a big problem for computer science.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most blockchains operate under the premise that they will be attacked by outside
    forces or by users of the system. The expected threat and the degree of trust
    that the network has in the nodes that operate the blockchain will determine the
    type of consensus algorithm that they use to settle their ledger. For example,
    Bitcoin and Ethereum expect a very high degree of threat and use a strong consensus
    algorithm called *proof of work.* There is no trust in the network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'On the other end of the spectrum, blockchains that are used to record financial
    transactions between known parties can use a lighter and faster consensus. Their
    need for high-speed transactions is more important. Proof of work is too slow
    and costly for them to operate because of the comparatively few participants within
    the network and immediate finality need for each transaction.  ## Blockchains

    other forms of hacking. IoT devices have also become more pervasive, and security

    of the equation. Where before asking for “trust” was a big deal, with blockchains
    it’s small. Also, the infrastructure that enforces the rule if that trust is broken
    can be lighter. Much of society is built on trust and enforcement of rules. The
    social and economic implications of blockchain applications can be emotionally
    and politically polarizing because blockchain will change how we structure value-based
    and socially based transactions.
