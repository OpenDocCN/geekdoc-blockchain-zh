    design the products, as it can recommend solutions based on the detailed brief
    provided by the engineers and designers by way of generative design software (AI-powered
    software). The brief can include different parameters like available manufacturing
    methods and material types as well as restrictions like time and budget constraints.
    The software can process the detailed brief, explore different permutations and
    combinations, and recommend most optimum product options. The recommended solutions
    can then be tested for actual performance across different manufacturing conditions
    and scenarios for finding the best of all proposed solutions.'

    tackled with the help of predictive maintenance, facilitated by BoIT. Predictive
    maintenance leverages AI’s key components—artificial neural networks and machine
    learning—to formulate predictions related to asset malfunction. The AI algorithms
    continuously assess the production process and flag anomalies (even microscopic
    faults) in order to take timely maintenance and repair actions for reducing the
    risk of unplanned downtime. It can also help in prolonging the Remaining Useful
    Life (RUL) production machineries. The minute-by-minute update on production gathered
    and studied by the AI algorithms offers the technicians with insight into the
    components that need inspection in the cases where maintenance is necessary.'

    under constant pressure of very short time-to-market deadlines, offering a product
    with high quality that meets quality standards and regulations can give a manufacturer
    sleepless nights. Industry 4.0 has given way to the new Quality 4.0 model, under
    which traditional quality methods are combined with the new technologies like
    machine learning, Big Data, and AI among others to attain operational excellence.
    AI algorithms can alert the production teams about emerging faults like subtle
    abnormalities in the functioning of machines, deviations from recipes, and other
    such issues that can cause issues with product quality.'
