    in our society. Digitization started with the introduction of mainframe computing
    that uses a large sized computer to connect people. Next, came the era of microcomputers
    which facilitates every individual to afford their own computational device. The
    first instance of the Internet called Advanced Research Projects Agency Network
    (ARPANET) came in the late 1960s with the interconnection of four university computer
    systems. Later, the TCP/IP protocol suite development expanded the network size.
    However, during the 1990's, the computing framework became more personal until
    the introduction of the World Wide Web (WWW). In 1991, the world's first website
    came online. The early days of the Internet were only popular for WWW, an interconnected
    network of HTML documents. This kind of web was just a source for military and
    scientific purposes. Next, this static HTML pages framework was upgraded to Web
    2.0 that involves user participation and interactions (social network sites, blogs,
    e-commerce, etc.). Since then the number of Internet connected devices has been
    increasing at an exponential rate. Currently, the web era we are a part of is
    Web 3.0 (also known as smarter web) which is moving beyond and toward Internet
    of Things. [Fig. 1.1](02chap_01.xhtml#fig1_1) shows the evolution of computing

    2.0，涉及用户参与和交互（社交网络站点、博客、电子商务等）。从那时起，互联网连接设备的数量呈指数增长。目前，我们所处的网络时代是Web 3.0（也称为智能网络），它正在超越并朝向物联网。[图

    1999\. However, this technology gained popularity after the year 2008\. Besides
    academic research, IoT is an area of interest for the industrial sector as well.
    In today's scenario, sensors are embedded in everyday things, such as lamps, watches,
    and mobile phones to name a few. With the usage of IoT, the life of a human being
    becomes easy and comfortable. Depending on the IoT application, various sensors,
    such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR),
    infrared, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) are used. The IoT is an emerging
    computing topic where everyday used physical objects are connected to the Internet
    (via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), bluetooth, RFID, near-field communication,
    LoRa, etc.) with minimal or no human input. Also, these devices are programmed
    to be controlled remotely with authorized access. The gateway layer connects IoT
    devices to the external world for remote control. Infact, WSN is a technology
    used within an IoT system, which enables aggregation of small sensor nodes to
    perform multiple tasks, including collection, aggregation, processing, and analyzing
    data [[199](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-199)], [[190](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-190)], [[201](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-201)].
    Smart devices in IoT networks involve machine-to-machine (M2M) communication to
    achieve tasks without any human intervention. Apart from (M2M), RFID, near-field
    communication (NFC), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) are some
    of the other technologies involved in realizing the idea of IoT. The IoT can range
    from wearable accessories to large electric machines, each embedded with a sensor
    chip. For example, the Apple watch contains sensors that provide tracking support,
    physical activity data, and heart rate data to be analyzed. Likewise, large electric
    machines, such as washing machines and refrigerators can be made fully automated
    with IoT enabled implementation. The future Internet will have heterogeneous devices
    connected together with new capabilities. Notably, IoT has proved to be the front-runner
    for strengthening the concept of ubiquitous computing [[127](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-127)].
    As the popularity of IoT is increasing, it is spreading into every aspect of life.
    Infact, the advancements in hardware techniques (such as improving bandwidth by
    using radio cognitive based network) and better connectivity services have made
    IoT more popular [[202](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-202)]. Other than personal use, IoT
    provides services to the community as well. It covers many commercial and industrial
    fields including healthcare, sports, transportation, entertainment, smart home,
    etc. [Fig. 1.2](02chap_01.xhtml#fig1_2) depicts the layerwise architecture of
    IoT for collection, transmission, and processing of data.

    billion Internet connected devices and it is predicted that over 75.44 billion
    smart devices will be connected with the Internet by the year 2025 [[223](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-223)]
    (as presented in [Fig. 1.3](02chap_01.xhtml#fig1_3)). The continuous contribution
    given by academia government, and private industries has definitely achieved new
    service requirements for IoT. Moreover, IoT technology has changed the scenario
    of storage from hard-disk with limited storage space to cloud storage with unlimited
    space.

    “Big Data.” Big data is a new era in the field of data utilization. It refers
    to a collection of large datasets having structured and unstructured data that
    is analyzed further to take intelligent decisions. The big data is assumed to
    be increased to 163 ZB by 2025 as per a report by International Data Corporation
    (IDC) [[2](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-2)]. Big data is characterized by 3 V's, i.e., volume,
    velocity, and variety. Although other research has introduced veracity, value,
    variability as additional characteristics [[85](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-85)]. Big data
    is used by many organizations to solve business problems and to bring innovations.
    New data sets from IoT system, satellites, social media, online gaming, etc. is
    a leading factor for the big data revolution. The dataset is so complex and voluminous
    that conventional software can't handle them [[205](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-205)].
    Additionally, in this abundance of generated data, there lacks the insight of
    useful data. However, data analytics are trying to develop sophisticated languages
    to analyze these huge data. However, as an advantage, an increase in data leads
    to an increase in accuracy and more confident decision making [[178](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-178)],

    advanced technologies to meet customer requirements. Also, this popularity of
    IoT has made analytics of big data more complicated due to the collection of data
    through heterogeneous devices in the IoT environment. The basic concept behind
    IoT is to connect all physical devices in the world (i.e., at home, workplace,
    in moving vehicles) via the Internet and then processing the information from
    collected data in order to take meaningful decisions. IoT generates data from
    different sources (variety) which may contribute to structured and unstructured
    data. Furthermore, the amount of IoT data can vary from gigabytes (GB) to zettabytes
    (ZB) (volume) and generated data may be collected in batches or streams (velocity)
    [[192](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-192)], [[50](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-50)]. Hence, with this
    enormous amount of data generated by IoT devices, we require an advanced data
    processing system. IoT data analysis can provide big insights into hidden analysis
    for a variety of areas, such as- health analysis, malware detection, business
    market analysis, and prediction, etc. Some of the IoT big data applications are
    shown in [Fig. 1.6](02chap_01.xhtml#fig1_6). Data mining, machine learning, deep
    learning, statistical analysis, etc. are some of the latest data analysis techniques
    to analyze data independently [[101](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-101)], [[211](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-211)].
    Over and above, IoT analytics are still not fully developed as most of the IoT
    generated data is still unexploited. Additionally, with the massive increase in
    data generation by IoT devices, a major concern is data storage and how to query
    such a large set of data in single pass [[150](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-150)]. In particular,
    big data analysis tools are utilized by researchers to solve the above mentioned
    challenges. [Fig. 1.7](02chap_01.xhtml#fig1_7) presents factors leading to big
    data revolution. The convergence of IoT and big data creates new opportunities
    in various sectors. The data generated from IoT sensors is then fed to big data
    framework for exploration and analysis. The aim of integrating big data with IoT
    is to analyze large amounts of data and to process it in real-time. Big data systems
    are adopting the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model to handle IoT data in a flexible
    and scalable way. In some cases, IoT analytics and processing are also collaborated
    with edge computing services which decentralizes IoT processing at the edge of
    the network [[162](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-162)]. However, selected data from edge
    nodes is still transferred to the cloud. Clearly, more the IoT system grows, the
    more it will create demand on business with respect to big data capabilities.

    by the time it is processed and analyzed. In contrast, stream processing of data
    is often more time sensitive over batch processing. Streaming data refers to data
    that is continuously generated by various data sources and collected simultaneously.
    For example, data generated from traffic light has no start or finish. Processing
    real-time streaming data as soon as it is collected can lead to an efficient system.
    Notably, the streaming data framework always assumes that data is being continuously
    generated and always moving. Most of the IoT data can be characterized as streaming
    data. Health sensors, traffic light sensors, temperature sensors, etc. are good
    studies for data streaming. Data streaming enables data to be analyzed in real-time
    and provides decisions for a wide range of activities. Therefore, to achieve real-time
    analytics, many researchers have adopted stream processing of data over batch
    processing. Hadoop MapReduce is the best and popular platform for batch processing
    whereas Apache Kafka, Apache storm, Apache Samza are some open source platforms
    for stream processing of data. Also, Apache flink is a popular open source data
    flow engine to achieve data distribution and fault tolerance over data streams
    with distributed computations. It offers almost zero latency as data is streamed
    in real-time. Notably, due to poor Internet connectivity and bandwidth limitations,
    earlier years of research refrains streaming data to reach the destination in
    a continuous fashion. However, streaming data faces challenges for scalability,
    data durability, and data storage. Therefore, in order to make real-time decisions
    on streaming data, a new paradigm is required that can process the data at a very
    high throughput speed. [Table 1.1](#tab1_1) shows the difference between batch
    and stream processing of data.

    data structures (PDS) as they have the capability to handle scalable and dynamic
    data efficiently. PDS are useful for applications that demand real-time response
    in performing queries on large data sets. Also, PDS optimizes time and space complexity
    for various queries, such as- membership, cardinality search, and frequency count,
    etc. The future chapters will discuss PDS and its types in detail.

- en: Edge computing is defined as a distributed computing architecture that supports
    data processing close to the place where things are located and generates the
    data. Edge computing is taking computing era towards more distributed architectures.
    Edge computing was introduced because of the exponential growth of IoT devices
    that further communicates with cloud [[123](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-123)]. This technology
    brings data storage, processing, and computations closer to the devices instead
    of relying on thousands of miles away from central location. As per a report from
    Gartner, 75% of the data will be produced outside the cloud by the year 2020 [[3](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-3)].
    In an edge computing scenario, sensors and devices transfer data to a nearby edge
    computing device (such as- a gateway, switch, router, and micro datacenter, etc.)
    that processes the data rather than sending it to a remote data center. The main
    purpose of designing edge computing is to address the cost of bandwidth while
    data travels long distance from data generation point to cloud storage. With this,
    data can be processed easily in real-time with significantly reduced latency in
    order to improve application performance. Security and privacy services can also
    be improved by storing sensitive data closer to the device. Also, with the local
    processing of data, a significant amount of money can be saved. The increasing
    growth and wide adoption of IoT within organizations are expected to rely more
    the edge computing market. It is expected that market size for edge computing
    world wide can reach 9 billion by the year 2024 as shown in [Fig. 1.9](02chap_01.xhtml#fig1_9)
    (a). Also, [Fig. 1.9](02chap_01.xhtml#fig1_9) (b) represents application wise
    market share of edge computing for year 2019 in $. Over and above, edge computing
    promotes new possibilities for IoT applications, in particular for using ML services
    for tasks such as- object detection, language processing, etc. This implies that
    there could be more efficient processing of data and less centralization of attributes.
    Many IoT applications including smart grid, Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV), Internet-of-Drones
    (IoD), autonomous vehicles, etc. can take benefits of edge computing. Some of
    the benefits of edge computing are depicted in [Fig. 1.10](02chap_01.xhtml#fig1_10).

- en: The global electricity consumption of users is predicted to rise by 30% by the
    year 2040 (compared to 2017) as reported in [[30](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-30)]. This
    ever-increasing demand is due to urbanization, increasing appliances craze, and
    population growth. In order to satisfy this demand, the issue of environmental
    pollution due to CO2 combustion has been raised as a critical issue. To design
    a complete IoT based smart homes and smart cities, an intelligent electricity
    distribution approach is required. Adopting renewable energy resources, Electric
    Vehicle (EV's), smart grids are some of the most effective solutions to deal with
    this problem. With the usage of distributed energy resources, the energy system
    is shifting towards decentralization. Additionally, the concept of local energy
    market is also getting popularity which involves local trading of electricity
    among different nodes of the network. Similarly, the smart grid provides an autonomous
    platform for generation, distribution, storage, and transmission of electricity.
    A smart grid framework maintains stability by balancing electricity generation
    and consumption among different utilities [[117](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-117)]. To
    collaborate a smart grid with distributed energy resources, microgrids are effectively
    used. With the usage of microgrids, it becomes easy for energy traders and consumers
    to trade energy locally which clearly minimizes transmission power loss. Over
    and above, EV's and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology are an important part of
    smart grid that contributes to developing a green eco-friendly environment. EV's
    enable better storage and energy balancing services in collaboration with wind
    and solar plants. Similarly, V2G technology facilitates EV's to act as an energy
    storage medium so that energy could be transfer back to the grid during peak hours
    for load balancing purposes. The owner of EV's gets paid in return for discharging
    electricity.

    challenges including software heterogeneity, verification, and validation of data
    and latency [[187](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-187)]. Recently, the integration of cognitive
    computing with IoT has achieved greater popularity as self-learning models are
    included in smart things with an aim to simulate human thought processes. This
    technology is referred to as cognitive Internet-of-Things (CIoT). Among various
    applications of CIoT, autonomous vehicles are a new craze among developers. Due

    time savings, improved traffic flow, autonomous parking, new business opportunities,
    customer-centric experience, and accident reduction are some of the key objectives
    to be achieved by autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles consist of programmed
    controlled AI agents to supervise, take decisions, and self-manage without human
    intervention. Autonomous vehicles are supposed to perform tasks including sensing
    neighborhood environment, control speed, and implement driverless driving without
    any human control. Additionally, requirements for physical road signals, vehicle
    insurance, and traffic police will get reduced with autonomous vehicle usage [[158](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-158)].
    Autonomous Vehicles: Autonomous vehicles are connected via a dedicated short-range
    communication (DSRC) protocol. These vehicles are equipped with a wide variety
    of sensors and actuators (piezoelectric sensors, microwave doppler RADAR sensors,
    inductive loop sensors, IR sensors, acoustics sensors, etc.) to process real-time
    traffic data for better operation and decision-making. These sensors help to provide
    information regarding speed, lane occupancy, object detection to accomplish tasks
    including traveling time delay, and traffic flow prediction. In particular, camera
    sensors are meant to support the surrounding view, RADAR sensors help in object
    detection whereas LIDAR sensors are used for collision avoidance. Also, software
    define networking (SDN) brings flexibility, programmability, and some other extensive
    advancements to autonomous vehicles [[43](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-43)], [[42](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-42)],

    connected with GPS based taxis and cellular record data. Autonomous vehicles demand
    lots of data collection and processing. All data shared among connected cars,
    access points, and Road Side Unit (RSU''s) is uploaded to a cloud server for processing
    and decision-making. Nevertheless, there is considerable cost of maintaining the
    collected data from different sources. Therefore, the nature of this collected
    data (volume, variety, velocity, quality) should be considered.'

    whereas sustainability, quality of life, urbanization, and smartness are the various
    attributes of smart cities [[147](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-147)]. The sustainability
    defines city infrastructure, climate change, social issues, waste management,
    water management governance, etc. The quality of service is calculated from the
    emotional and financial well-being of the citizens. The urbanization includes
    aspects, such as- infrastructure, technology, and economics. The smartness includes,
    aspects such as- smart living, smart economy, smart mobility, etc. Design cost,
    reliable communication, operational efficiency, disaster resilience, system failure,
    public safety, and carbon emission are the few challenges for building smart cities.

    integrity, authentication, authorization, and availability are important to achieve.
    Notably, IoT components are unattended mostly, so it is easy to compromise them.
    Also, adopting weak passwords and using default passwords are common loopholes
    for authentication attacks [[186](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-186)]. Moreover, device connection
    via web interface opens up chances for attacks, such as- Structured Query Language
    (SQL) injection and cross-site scripting. Similarly, in order to provide remote
    services, IoT devices use telnet services to which attacks, such as Distributed
    Denial of Service (DDoS), eavesdropping and TCP SYN can be launched easily [[219](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-219)].
    For example, the Mirai botnet attack on Oct. 21, 2016 infected multiple IoT devices.
    Next, these attacked IoT devices were used to flood Domain Name System (DNS) service
    provider “Dyn” by launching DDoS attack. As a result, this botnet brings down
    various social network sites. Similarly, attacks such as- Sybil and spoofing attacks
    can be launched on IoT devices to lower down network performance and to destroy
    data privacy. [Fig. 3.1](04chap_03.xhtml#fig3_1) (a) shows security spending worldwide
    on IoT for the year 2016-2021\. Hence, it is important to build IoT devices with
    high security control.

    network due to the presence of heterogeneous data generated from variety of sensors.
    Also, security is a prominent challenge due to openness of system which has inter-connection
    to the Internet via a wireless communication medium. Additionally, conventional
    security solutions including firewall, and anti-virus are not convenient for IoT
    because of limited space and energy [[33](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-33)]. Hence, designing
    optimal energy consumption based security solution is one of the important issues
    in IoT that needs special attention [[188](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-188)]. Literature
    supports various cryptographic protocols including Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA),
    Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), Diffie Hellman (DH) key exchange, etc. to handle
    these security problems. Security solutions that use encryption are also not suitable
    for IoT as these constrained devices are not capable of implementing complex encryption
    and decryption. Additionally, all these security protocols rely on a pair of cryptographic
    keys and for generation, management of these key pairs, IoT manufacturers are
    dependent on a centralized, trusted third-party. Over and above, digital certificate
    checking, maintenance, and revocation are also dependent on a centralized party
    called “Registration authority”. Notably, having a centralized party can become
    a single point of failure and also a reason for privacy attacks on data. Furthermore,
    it is problematic to issue a digital certificate to each and every object as strength
    of IoT objects in quite large. Hence, key requirements including authorization,
    authentication, availability, non-repudiation, and trust need to be addressed
    for future IoT networks.

    in real-time. The current framework of the data center is not efficient to deal
    with the heterogeneous nature of data. A lot of research is going in both academic
    and industrial areas to handle data management issues in IoT. As per a report
    from the international Data Corporation the data generated by IoT devices is expected
    to grow to 79.24 ZB by the year 2025 from 33 ZB in the year 2018 [[7](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-7)].

- en: One of the major concerns for data management is data storage. There are basically
    three types of IoT data storage, i.e., local, distributed, and centralized. The
    local type signifies that data generated by IoT sensors will be stored on the
    IoT device itself. The distributed processing signifies that data will be stored
    at the edge and processed via distributed technologies whereas the centralized
    type means that collected data is stored at a data center. As mentioned, IoT devices
    lack power and have limited storage, so data storage on IoT devices is not possible.
    Also, data centers employed to store data generated by IoT devices should have
    enough energy and power resources in order to process queries when required. However,
    in future, the forecasted data generated by IoT devices can overload cloud infrastructure.
    Moreover, storing data at a distant and centralized location can lead to high
    response time while processing any query. Therefore, IoT data should be stored
    at a distributed location that is closer to the data-generation point.

    data having privacy-sensitive information. For example, smart health wearables
    and equipment generate a large amount of IoT data that contains the user's location,
    health conditions, sleeping patterns, etc. Notably, this data is stored on third-party
    cloud providers. Additionally, the user's behavior from its browsing Internet
    interest is collected by third-party in order to enrich the user's experience.
    Hence, providing privacy is often required in such scenarios including healthcare,
    electricity data, military applications, etc. [[207](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-207)].
    Privacy is the ability of the devices to have a check on when and with whom personal
    information of the devices is to be shared [[217](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-217)]. Also,
    the personal data being collected should be accessed by authorized service providers.
    Traditional privacy-preserving methods are expensive for IoT due to high energy
    consumption and processing overhead. Notably, by relying on a centralized cloud
    server (third-party auditor), users are not aware of how much personal information
    is being shared with other parties. Additionally, most of the state-of-the-art
    privacy framework is based on centralized structure and hence not suitable for
    IoT because of scalability issues and single point of failure. Hence, the IoT
    system requires a lightweight, scalable, and distributed privacy safeguard.

- en: IoT connects different IoT entities with different complexities and different
    vendors. Recently, researchers have developed multiple hardware and software platforms
    for IoT. Instead of involving one particular type of hardware device or software,
    interactions in IoT depend on a sea of different types of smart and connected
    devices. The date release, version, technical interfaces, and bitrates of IoT
    devices may be different. Moreover, the IoT system depicts heterogeneity in terms
    of communication protocol, data format, and infrastructure. As many heterogeneous
    things are connected to the Internet, a specified architecture that supports for
    easy connectivity, control, and communication is required. Over and above, to
    support automation, different devices should have synchronized clocks. Also, the
    environment for IoT is dynamic, i.e., a device might have a connection to an entirely
    different set of devices than at another time. Due to high heterogeneity of devices,
    IoT lacks scalability, interoperability, reliability, availability, and security
    in the network. Therefore, interoperability must be deployed among all network
    technologies taking into account their mode, network providers, and vendors.

    Delay in network operation degrades IoT system performance and quality-of-service
    (QoS) [[169](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-169)]. Generally, IoT data has to be sent to the
    cloud for computational processing because of limited computational capabilities
    of these devices. However, IoT users request for accessing this data from different
    parts of the globe. So, to handle such multiple requests is a difficult task for
    a centralized cloud server. Moreover, due to the presence of cloud server at a
    distant location, latency in accessing services is obvious. Besides, there are
    some delay-sensitive applications (military, health, transportation) that demand
    immediate processing of queries. Hence, it is important to design a computing
    infrastructure that supports low latency and fast response time. Along with high
    delays, communicating directly with the cloud creates network bandwidth overload.
    Nevertheless, with the recent advancements including fog/edge computing the problem
    of latency is mitigated with a little investment on computing and storage resources
    [[126](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-126)], [[189](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-189)]. Hence, some
    information should be processed near to devices in order to implement IoT with
    fewer challenges. It can be noticed from [Fig. 3.2](04chap_03.xhtml#fig3_2), that
    cloud framework had a greater delay as compared to edge/fog computing technologies.
    Therefore, it is preferable to use fog/edge computing for latency sensitive services
    [[184](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-184)]. Fog/edge computing supports an intelligent layer
    between cloud and IoT devices that enables low latency, location awareness, and
    geographical distribution for IoT [[128](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-128)], [[206](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-206)].
    Clearly, cloud computing supports centralization whereas fog computing gives rise
    to decentralization. Moreover, a recent technology named Tactile Internet has
    been used as a latest Internet network that achieves ultra low latency along with
    high availability, reliability, and security [[57](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-57)], [[100](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-100)],
    [[56](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-56)], [[115](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-115)].

    via the Internet. IoT communication is the base for remote monitoring, data analytics,
    and information exchange. To fully connect IoT devices, a reliable and bidirectional
    signaling is required for collection and transferring data between devices. In
    this context, IoT supports divergent wireless network. Also, the latest technology
    in wireless communication is more concerned with delivering sensitive information
    to destination including energy, latency, reliability, and security [[191](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-191)].
    However, IoT network is prone to security attack due to wireless nature of sensor
    network, attack such as- spoofing, sink hole attack, Sybil attack, worm hole attack,
    and DDoS. Therefore, to utilize the full potential of IoT, some challenges faced
    by IoT communication must be addressed.

    for IoT that needs to be considered for effective development of IoT use cases
    as most IoT services are meant to be delivered to mobile users [[175](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-175)].
    This is an important assertion of IoT to make sure that IoT nodes are connected
    anywhere and anytime. Smart mobile phones sometimes experience interruption due
    to device mobility. Therefore, an effective mobility system is required to manage
    the growth of connected devices in IoT. The existing cellular network needs to
    deploy some more base stations to efficiently connect all devices of the network
    together.

    in the implementation of IoT as smart devices are contributing to drive up signaling
    load in the network as compared to conventional human-to-human (H2H) traffic.
    With high network congestion, IoT performance and Quality-of-Service (QoS) of
    the network degrades. Therefore, the TCP/IP protocol has to deal effectively with
    the network congestion problem [[204](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-204)]. However, the current
    TCP implementation is not applicable for IoT application scenarios as the traffic
    pattern of IoT networks is totally different from the traditional network.

    To deal with this problem, communication technology should enforce minimal battery
    drain and minimum power consumption. Along with this, bandwidth consumption is
    another issue for IoT connectivity. Moreover, optimal energy utilization is one
    of the important issues in IoT that needs attention [[188](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-188)],
    [[200](bib.xhtml#ch00-bib-200)]. Therefore, a lightweight network is required
    to seamlessly transfer data among devices and server.

    has several limitations. In particular, the data stored on cloud face privacy
    issues as the third-party may alter the user's data without consent. Also, centralized
    servers are more vulnerable to DDoS attack. Moreover, in case of heavy load, centralized
    server may not generate quick response for user's queries. Most importantly, centralized
    server may lead to a single point of failure.
