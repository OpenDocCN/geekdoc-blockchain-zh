    potential targets for the blockchain, and they are related to the economy, industries,
    government, or society. Some of these problems are rooted by philosophical or
    ideological underpinnings. Pick your flavor of grievance or issue around the world,
    and there might be a decentralization-based alternative flavor for a solution
    that is undoubtedly linked to a blockchain.

    points to no incumbents in that equation. The new startups give no regards to
    existing central services, and they attempt to build a better service that takes
    advantage of the decentralization features of the blockchain.

    Semi-public to be precise, because the information is cryptographically secure,
    and only visible if you have access rights. It means anyone can publish data on
    the blockchains. Previously, everything important was behind hidden databases,
    or a physical service counter, and we had to go somewhere to verify something.
    Now, we will learn to expose data, and break databases into pieces, without security
    fears.'

    Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) whose governance and operations run
    on the blockchain. Arguably, this could be the epitome of business decentralization.

    and benefit economically from it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of a Distributed Autonomous Organization/Corporation (DAO/DAC) is
    an idealistic outcome of the crypto-tech revolution. Its roots originate in themes
    on organizational decentralization that were depicted by Ori Brafman in *The Starfish
    and the Spider* (2007), and ones about “peer production,” aptly described by Yochai
    Benkler in *The Wealth of Networks* (2007). But these two themes were recently
    joined by the advent of cryptocurrency-related technologies by Dan Larimer who
    observed that Bitcoin is the original DAC, and Vitalik Buterin who expanded on
    that construct by generalizing it further as a DAO, noting that the DAO has “internal
    capital.” Deregulation of crowdfunding and unbundling of services were two aliitionally
    paired themes that alied to this combustion, and the whole thing was turbo-charged
    by a crypto-tech governance layer of technologies and trust-based automations
    to allow DAOs to “run without any human involvement under the control of an incorruptible
    set of business rules.”^([1](part0012.xhtml#c05-note-1))

    that data is owned by the user, and only accessible in a specific aggregate or

    there needs to be a specific linkage between user actions and the resulting effects

    value of the cryptocurrency that is underlying it. That is where entrepreneurial
    creativity needs to take place, and where business models will be concocted.

    Yes, this is a a warning. Many of these DAOs will be theoretical in their inception
    stages. A cryptocurrency crowdsale only enables the DAO to start on a path. At
    the end of the day, a new DAO is like a startup. It requires a product/market
    fit, business model realization, and a lot of users (customers) to move forward.
    Early on, a lot of assumptions are made, and the DAO may resemble a science fiction
    project, until the product or service hits the reality of market forces that decide
    its viability. The “proof of success” will be sustainability in the market, not
    the crowdfunding success.
