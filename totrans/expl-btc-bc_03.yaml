    a decade it has been! Bitcoin is the first purely decentralized currency that
    does not need any trusted third-party to mediate a transaction, making it the
    digital equivalent of physical cash. Today, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies,
    and many are having different value propositions. And it is not just cryptocurrencies;
    the whole ecosystem continues to evolve, bringing fresh innovations.

    all the cryptocurrencies combined is $1.8 trillion. There are a few hundred thousand
    tokens written over various cryptocurrencies. There are over 500 exchanges where
    you can buy or sell cryptocurrencies. There are over 10,000 cryptocurrency ATMs

    is a record of the transfer of the cryptocurrency between the funding parties
    and the receiving parties. Later, we built other distributed ledgers storing asset
    transfer information and self-enforcing agreements between parties. These distributed
    ledger systems relied on the blockchain. Then, a few innovative ideas appeared

    consists of immutable lists of transactions or smart contracts. Similar to a ledger,
    it is a book of records. It is shared with others in the network. DLT is an umbrella
    term, and blockchain falls under it. DLT stands for **Distributed Ledger Technology**
    (**DLT**); it can be classified as blockchain-based implementations and non-blockchain-based
    implementations. Few cryptocurrencies use some other methods of storing records;
    for example, IOTA uses **Directed Acyclic Graph** (**DAG**). Hashgraph is yet
    another technology used for distributed record keeping. These are also referred
    to as DLT.

    implementations and platforms that had access control and were built to keep records
    safe behind firewalls. These blockchain implementations were created for use within
    an organization or between a consortium of organizations, and they are called
    private blockchains. The private blockchain implementations for consortiums provide
    federated architecture consisting of multiple chains.

    an inflation rate is a rate at which the prices of goods and services rise over
    a period. In Bitcoin terminology, inflation is the rate at which new bitcoin is
    mined or minted, or created. Inflation is controlled by an algorithm, and it reduces
    by half nearly every 4 years. Different cryptocurrencies have different inflation
    rules.

    transferring a bitcoin did not require payment to Bitcoin miners as anyone could
    mint a bitcoin on their laptop. Large supply, low value, zero transaction fee,
    and global presence made Bitcoin a good medium of payment. However, as time passed,
    bitcoin value increased, network fees increased, and supply started going down,
    which made it an incredibly good appreciating asset. It is still used as medium-of-exchange,
    and many merchants across the globe accept it.

    smart contract. The scripting language is very primitive and does not provide
    a viable platform for building complex real-world contracts. To address this,
    *Vitalik Buterin* created a cryptocurrency called Ethereum that supported Turing
    complete *solidity language* for writing contracts. This language allowed developers
    to create tokens much faster than creating a cryptocurrency. This led to **Initial
    Coin Offering** (**ICO**) for raising funds through a token sale, Security Tokens,
    Utility Tokens, **Decentralized Finance** (**DeFi**), and recently **non-fungible
    tokens** (**NFT**). This attracted massive interest in blockchain technology to

    computers, and laptops around 2013, the first ASIC hardware hit the market, raising
    network fees. It became clear that if network fees keep on increasing, bitcoin
    as a payment instrument for buying low-value items like coffee will not remain
    viable. The Bitcoin development community was divided on whether to increase block
    size for reducing transaction fees or to keep it the same so that the Bitcoin
    network does not have to compromise on security.
  prefs: []

    ASIC-resistant mining algorithm. The idea was to use algorithms that require memory
    instead of faster processing as ASIC hardware is efficient at solving CPU-intensive
    problems and not good for memory-hard problems.

    buy bitcoin from an exchange, we need to provide KYC to the exchange. The exchange
    knows about your transactions, and all related transactions are also on the blockchain.
    Exchanges can leak this information to criminals, hackers, foreign governments,
    advertisers, etc. Exchanges can also link other transactions on the blockchain,
    and you may lose your financial privacy. There are a few methods that provide
    ways to make Bitcoin transactions more private, but these are not as good as cryptocurrencies,
    which are designed with privacy as the goal. Monero, Dash, Zcash, and Zcoin are
    some of the cryptocurrencies designed specifically with privacy as the goal.
