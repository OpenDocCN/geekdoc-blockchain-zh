    data to help develop new business models. This led to more efficient customer
    engagements, and the rise of online services has opened up a whole new way of
    working in many industries. Over the last 20 years, data strategy has become the
    foundation, and digital transformation is now largely reliant on data.

    more things digitally, it has much broader scope than that. Digital transformation
    is about improving customer experiences and understanding the customers and competitors
    much better and using technology to address the business demands. On the other
    side, enterprises can also achieve efficiency in their operations with digital.
    To achieve these goals, enterprises need insights which purely come from data.
    This is one of the core reasons why data has become so much more important and
    hence why the “data-first” philosophy has become so popular. Data first effectively
    means that for any enterprise, data is the first thing to look at when making

    accurate. This means that related and relevant data from different devices and
    systems needs to come together at the same time which needs to be correlated in
    real time to make sense of the data. As an example, if we are reading a temperature
    data from a sensor related to the environment and if there is a failure in an
    equipment, it is essential that the exact time and the exact temperature data
    are correlated to derive a meaningful insight from the data. If we are unable
    to correlate these two data points, it is meaningless and there is no point in
    even collecting this data. This means that data from different devices needs to
    come with minimal to zero latency, else there is no value for this data later.
    Apart from timeliness and accuracy of the data, enterprises need to look at solutions
    that can bring both these data points together just in time to make sure that
    they are able to take some actions based on the insights generated from this data.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third area which enterprises need to focus on while embarking on their IoT
    journey is to determine where the complex process of data management happens.
    Once data is picked up from the sensors, it is ingested into the Smart IoT Gateways
    and in some cases is sent to the IoT Cloud Platform where data is cleansed and
    transformed, after which insights are generated from the data. Whether this needs
    to happen at the Smart IoT Gateway level or the IoT Cloud Platform or on the devices
    needs to be answered based on which appropriate solutions need to be chosen. Such
    a decision depends on the use case and the industry for which use cases are being
    developed. As an example, in a smart agriculture use case, if a certain plant
    does not get enough water, we can come back the next day and water the plant.
    There is no major impact even if actions are taken at a later point in time or
    even if analytics goes wrong – in all such cases, economically it will still be
    all right to perform data management by the IoT Cloud Platform, where data latency
    will not cause major impact to the IoT use case. However, in use cases such as
    mining where we need to actually control the crude oil that comes out from the
    pipes, we need to be able to divert the crude oil at the right time to the right
    unit for processing, else there are massive losses that enterprises can incur.
    Furthermore, in a self-driving car use case, latency can lead to deaths or accidents.
    For all such time-critical use cases, it is important that data management and
    insights happen at the IoT Gateway level with a mandate that these Gateways will
    reside just near to the devices. In some cases, data management and insights need
    to be performed by the device itself.

    round of the satellite data collection. However, the agility required was not

    higher demands on agility. Data is transmitted and needs to be collected at second
    levels or sometimes subsecond levels, and in many use cases, data would be relevant
    for that moment of time, such as temperature data. So enterprises need to be able
    to process the data as soon as they receive it, perform analytics and take actions,
    and then discard the data and keep storage free for the next set of data to come
    in. This brings in a key expectation from a data perspective in IoT use cases,

    standards and policies that also control data usage. Effective DG ensures that
    data is consistent and trustworthy and does not get misused. It is increasingly

    works well if the baseline (e.g., requirements) for the project does not change
    during the course of project execution. In an IoT context, the baselines are ever
    changing – as an example, there may be 100 devices to connect today, and we would
    have 10,000 tomorrow. This is one of the reasons why organizations following a
    project model for IoT use cases are failing even though they are delivering on
    cost, time, and scope. A scope cannot be fixed in an IoT context for longer durations.

    even in a normal software development engagement. A quote of the former CEO of
    a large phone manufacturer named ABC Mobile, who lost their business to their
    competitor (Apple), comes to my mind during this discussion. He said that he did
    not do anything wrong, but somehow he lost. The projects his company was performing
    were all running fine, they embraced the Agile methodology, and they had an awesome
    track record of really building phone after phone. But while ABC Mobile was building
    phones in a project approach, the market changed, and people were not buying the
    kind of phones which this company was selling, and they lost their complete user
    base to another company (Apple).

    scope, ignoring the market, and by the time the project is delivered, the market
    changes.

    another interesting perspective about ABC Mobile is that they realized a year
    before that something is going to change fundamentally with phones. They knew
    that there was going to be phones with large glass screens, and Apple was going
    to make something called an iPhone. With that, ABC Mobile realized that customer
    experience with the mobile phones was going to be basically driven by software
    (with widgets and app stores), and it will no longer going to be physical buttons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of people think that ABC Mobile missed the revolution by not realizing
    that they needed big glass screens. However, the reality is that they knew a year
    before that the industry will move toward software-driven phones. Once they realized
    it, they brought in some of the best consultants, they hired more developers,
    and they realized that they needed to become software innovators and develop in
    a more iterative manner – and they did this all. They embraced the Agile methodology
    to develop phones. In 2009, I remember ABC Mobile was the poster child to adopt
    the Agile methodology, their employees were trained in Agile, and everyone started
    developing using the Agile methodology. The main focus for ABC Mobile during that
    time was on agile trainings and embracing the Agile methodology. This is what
    ABC Mobile called the transformation. Within the company, developers were trained
    on Agile, they were using agile tools, using agile methods, and building the phones,
    but nothing was moving faster. The CEO was measuring the transformation through
    these metrics, whether people were trained on Agile and whether they were using
    the agile toolkits, and with these metrics it appeared to the executive that the
    whole transformation was on track.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then this way of working was actually not solving their core problem. The
    core problem ABC Mobile had was with their software architecture. The operating
    system they had did not allow them to fit the big screens effectively or support
    an app store. By the time they realized this gap, iPhone was released, and ABC
    Mobile went out of the market. ABC Mobile adopted a project-based structure, though
    they adopted Agile which was the main reason for this failure. They operated in
    a project-based structure with a fixed scope, time, and cost (using Agile), and
    this turned out to be quite disconnected in terms of how they were measuring their
    agility and how value is actually flowing in the organization.

    IoT product organization also has a measurable outcome, offers quicker business
    results, improved customer experiences, improved efficiency, reduced friction

    trust across the business since an IoT use case has its own measurable business
    benefit. A product-centric setup allows for better engagement and full ownership
    between IoT team and business units since product owners from the business side
    are part of the team delivering the IoT use case end to end. The measurable outcome
    in a product-based organization for every enhancement or new business functionality
    is based on how fast the new functionality is released to the market, how many
    new customers a new feature is able to attract, and if the customer satisfaction
    has improved after adding a new feature to the overall product. Alternatively,
    if an IoT use case is developed to increase operation efficiency, outcomes are
    measured as how much gain the product has brought to the business, such as reducing
    machine downtimes or increasing utilization of machineries in a manufacturing
    context or automatic detection of diseases with accuracy in a healthcare context.
    This measurement contrasts with traditional metrics in a project organization
    where for every new business functionality development, teams are measured on
    the number of defects in production, quality of the resources, and so on. Traditional
    metrics in product organizations do not vanish but are treated as secondary measures

    teams and over a period of time. Agile methods generally promote a lightweight
    product management process that includes frequent monitoring and adapting to changes
    quickly that encourages teamwork, self-organizing, and self-accountability. In
    addition, there is a set of good practices that allows for rapid delivery of high-quality
    products, as well as a business approach that aligns development with business
    needs and the organization’s goals. Scrum is one such Agile methodology where
    software is built in smaller increments called sprints. A sprint is a short, timeboxed
    period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at
    the very heart of Scrum and Agile methodologies. A combination of multiple sprints

    operations. They ensure that all control and automation technologies enable seamless
    production and operation processes. OT has been intentionally separated from IT,
    and they have different people, goals, policies, and projects. This independence
    drives OT teams to be agile and efficient on the shop floor. In recent years,
    IT-OT integration has taken several industries by storm and represents a new source
    of data that can be leveraged to increase factory efficiency using IT. This new
    era of connectivity presents the OT team with many opportunities to further manage,
    automate, and optimize the shop floor and production processes. Unfortunately,
    without IT and OT team integration  , these opportunities cannot be capitalized
    upon in IoT use cases. Consider this: if shop floor data is not integrated with
    data from IT systems, operational excellence and production optimization are difficult

    machines, and these machines generate a lot of data that needs to be analyzed
    in real time to give a full picture of what is happening on the floor or even
    in a single machine. For example, in a shoe manufacturing plant, the machine creating
    soles can notify the team responsible for sole stitching when there is an unexpected
    delay or backlog, allowing them to switch to other tasks while maintenance is
    carried out. This facility-wide visibility is simply impossible without data connectivity,
    and as such having a big data platform is a must for enterprises embarking on
    an IoT journey. As we discussed in Chapter [11](517610_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml),
    with a big data platform enterprises will be able to bring in all kinds of data
    from the operational equipment and create a centralized IoT network. Subsequently,

    first started leveraging client/server networks and the Internet, they did not
    think about security until criminals realized they could hack into IT systems
    to manipulate them and steal money and data. OT environments today face similar
    challenges when connecting industrial control system (ICS) technologies to the
    Internet. Until recently, OT was interconnected with proprietary, vendor-based
    closed connections and protocols that could not be accessed remotely. Now that
    ICS technologies are moving toward exposing themselves to the Internet, IT security
    challenges have become part of OT environments. This is one of the reasons why
    security considerations should be planned from day one in IoT, and a security
    advisor is the one who plays this role.

    thoroughly from a cyber security perspective. Security in the context of IoT means
    how IT systems will interact with the devices that are part of the OT systems
    and the security pertaining to these systems, sensors, and devices. Choosing devices
    that have built-in security features, and shortlisting capable IoT device vendors
    who manufacture those devices, is another important role a security advisor performs.

    target IoT devices using the Gateway. The security advisor disagreed for these

    cycle (formerly known as release engineering) using automation. DevOps focuses
    on continuous integration and [continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)
    of software by leveraging on-demand IT resources (infrastructure as code) and
    by automating the integration, test, and deployment of code. This merging of software
    development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) reduces time to deployment, decreases
    time to market, minimizes defects, and shortens the time required to resolve issues.
    By introducing security controls as part of the DevOps cycle, enterprises can
    achieve speed of development with increased security, and such a practice is called
    DevSecOps.
  prefs: []

    been able to reduce their product release cycle time from months to (literally)
    days. This has enabled them to grow and lead in fast-paced, emerging markets,
    and IoT is one area where [DevSecOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) brings
    in a lot of value. Companies like Google, Amazon, and many others now release
    software many times per day. By improving the quality and cycle time of product
    releases and with the introduction of security in DevOps, DevSecOps has gained
    in popularity and been a great success for a number of enterprises in IoT product
    development. Traditionally, what happens in the legacy world is that developers
    create their code and pass it to quality assurance or testing teams, who then
    test the code, identify any bugs, and pass it back to developers. Developers will
    then fix the code and return it for more testing, before it is handed over to
    the operations teams for support and maintenance of the product. This is a common
    practice which is followed in a waterfall development methodology. An agile software
    development process also partly follows this model with an exception that developers
    and testers within the development cycle work in tandem without any handoffs,
    although handoffs are still passed to the operations team after testing for deployment.
    This clearly shows a lack of collaboration between development, testing, and deployment
    teams, which ultimately leads to a slow development and deployment cycle. DevSecOps
    eliminates this challenge completely since there is only one team for development,
    security, and operations, and therefore there are no handoffs.

    shop floors. If there is a feedback from the connected devices, the ability to

    they should quickly scale from a couple of devices (during the pilot stage) to
    thousands of devices (production stage) in a matter of weeks; so systems should
    be designed to manage this load. Once DevSecOps is enabled in enterprises for
    their IoT use cases, the setup can scale to any number of use cases and devices.

    an individual is assessed on their development skills from several angles, such
    as code quality, security, reliability, and maintainability. This clearly articulates
    the coding style of an individual and provides a view on their strengths and weaknesses,
    based on which decisions can be made. This implies that projects will be far more
