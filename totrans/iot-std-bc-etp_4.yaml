    real time to make sense of the data. As an example, if we are reading a temperature
    data from a sensor related to the environment and if there is a failure in an
    equipment, it is essential that the exact time and the exact temperature data
    are correlated to derive a meaningful insight from the data. If we are unable
    to correlate these two data points, it is meaningless and there is no point in
    even collecting this data. This means that data from different devices needs to
    come with minimal to zero latency, else there is no value for this data later.
    Apart from timeliness and accuracy of the data, enterprises need to look at solutions

  zh: 数据管理和洞察应该发生在哪里
- en: The third area which enterprises need to focus on while embarking on their IoT
    journey is to determine where the complex process of data management happens.
    Once data is picked up from the sensors, it is ingested into the Smart IoT Gateways
    and in some cases is sent to the IoT Cloud Platform where data is cleansed and
    transformed, after which insights are generated from the data. Whether this needs
    to happen at the Smart IoT Gateway level or the IoT Cloud Platform or on the devices
    needs to be answered based on which appropriate solutions need to be chosen. Such
    a decision depends on the use case and the industry for which use cases are being
    developed. As an example, in a smart agriculture use case, if a certain plant
    does not get enough water, we can come back the next day and water the plant.
    There is no major impact even if actions are taken at a later point in time or
    even if analytics goes wrong – in all such cases, economically it will still be
    all right to perform data management by the IoT Cloud Platform, where data latency
    will not cause major impact to the IoT use case. However, in use cases such as
    mining where we need to actually control the crude oil that comes out from the
    pipes, we need to be able to divert the crude oil at the right time to the right
    unit for processing, else there are massive losses that enterprises can incur.
    Furthermore, in a self-driving car use case, latency can lead to deaths or accidents.
    For all such time-critical use cases, it is important that data management and
    insights happen at the IoT Gateway level with a mandate that these Gateways will
    reside just near to the devices. In some cases, data management and insights need
    to be performed by the device itself.

  zh: 企业在开展物联网之旅时需要关注的第三个领域是确定复杂的数据管理过程发生的位置。一旦数据从传感器中提取出来，它就被输入到智能物联网网关中，在某些情况下，数据被发送到物联网云平台，数据被清理和转换，然后从数据中生成洞察。这是否需要在智能物联网网关级别、物联网云平台级别或设备上进行需要根据需要选择适当的解决方案来回答。这样的决定取决于正在开发用例的用例和行业。例如，在智能农业用例中，如果某种植物没有得到足够的水，我们可以在第二天回来给植物浇水。即使在以后的某个时间点采取行动，或者即使分析出现错误
    - 在所有这些情况下，经济上仍然可以通过在物联网云平台执行数据管理来处理，其中数据延迟不会对物联网用例造成重大影响。然而，在需要实际控制从管道中流出的原油的采用案例中，例如采矿，我们需要能够在适当的时间将原油转移到适当的单位进行处理，否则企业可能会遭受巨大损失。此外，在自动驾驶汽车用例中，延迟可能导致死亡或事故。对于所有这些时间关键性的用例，重要的是数据管理和洞察发生在物联网网关级别，并要求这些网关将位于设备附近。在某些情况下，数据管理和洞察需要由设备本身执行。

    higher demands on agility. Data is transmitted and needs to be collected at second
    levels or sometimes subsecond levels, and in many use cases, data would be relevant
    for that moment of time, such as temperature data. So enterprises need to be able
    to process the data as soon as they receive it, perform analytics and take actions,
    and then discard the data and keep storage free for the next set of data to come

    have 10,000 tomorrow. This is one of the reasons why organizations following a

    not do anything wrong, but somehow he lost. The projects his company was performing
    were all running fine, they embraced the Agile methodology, and they had an awesome
    track record of really building phone after phone. But while ABC Mobile was building
    phones in a project approach, the market changed, and people were not buying the

    Mobile以项目方式建造手机的同时，市场发生了变化，人们不再购买这家公司销售的那种手机，他们将完整的用户群体失去给了另一家公司（苹果）。

    another interesting perspective about ABC Mobile is that they realized a year
    before that something is going to change fundamentally with phones. They knew
    that there was going to be phones with large glass screens, and Apple was going
    to make something called an iPhone. With that, ABC Mobile realized that customer

  zh: 上面是关于 ABC Mobile 的一个观点。与前面的讨论相比，关于 ABC Mobile 的另一个有趣的观点是，他们在一年前意识到手机将会发生根本性的变化。他们知道将会有大屏幕玻璃的手机出现，而且苹果将会推出一种叫做
    iPhone 的东西。由此，ABC Mobile 意识到手机的客户体验基本上将由软件驱动（带有小部件和应用商店），而不再是物理按钮。
- en: A lot of people think that ABC Mobile missed the revolution by not realizing
    that they needed big glass screens. However, the reality is that they knew a year
    before that the industry will move toward software-driven phones. Once they realized
    it, they brought in some of the best consultants, they hired more developers,
    and they realized that they needed to become software innovators and develop in
    a more iterative manner – and they did this all. They embraced the Agile methodology
    to develop phones. In 2009, I remember ABC Mobile was the poster child to adopt
    the Agile methodology, their employees were trained in Agile, and everyone started
    developing using the Agile methodology. The main focus for ABC Mobile during that
    time was on agile trainings and embracing the Agile methodology. This is what
    ABC Mobile called the transformation. Within the company, developers were trained
    on Agile, they were using agile tools, using agile methods, and building the phones,
    but nothing was moving faster. The CEO was measuring the transformation through
    these metrics, whether people were trained on Agile and whether they were using
    the agile toolkits, and with these metrics it appeared to the executive that the
    whole transformation was on track.

  zh: 很多人认为 ABC Mobile 错过了革命，因为他们没有意识到他们需要大屏幕玻璃。然而，事实是，他们在一年前就知道行业将转向由软件驱动的手机。一旦他们意识到了这一点，他们引进了一些最优秀的顾问，他们聘请了更多的开发人员，他们意识到他们需要成为软件创新者，并以更迭的方式开发
    - 他们做到了。他们采用了敏捷方法来开发手机。我记得在 2009 年，ABC Mobile 是采用敏捷方法的楷模，他们的员工都接受了敏捷培训，每个人开始使用敏捷方法进行开发。在那个时候，ABC
    Mobile 的主要焦点是敏捷培训和接受敏捷方法。这就是 ABC Mobile 所称的转型。在公司内部，开发人员接受了敏捷培训，他们使用敏捷工具，使用敏捷方法，构建手机，但是没有什么是在更快地进行。首席执行官通过这些指标来衡量转型，看人们是否接受了敏捷培训，是否使用了敏捷工具包，而根据这些指标，高管似乎整个转型都在按计划进行。
- en: But then this way of working was actually not solving their core problem. The
    core problem ABC Mobile had was with their software architecture. The operating
    system they had did not allow them to fit the big screens effectively or support
    an app store. By the time they realized this gap, iPhone was released, and ABC
    Mobile went out of the market. ABC Mobile adopted a project-based structure, though
    they adopted Agile which was the main reason for this failure. They operated in
    a project-based structure with a fixed scope, time, and cost (using Agile), and
    this turned out to be quite disconnected in terms of how they were measuring their
    agility and how value is actually flowing in the organization.

    IoT product organization also has a measurable outcome, offers quicker business
    results, improved customer experiences, improved efficiency, reduced friction
    within the organization, and more flexibility. All of this results in increased
    trust across the business since an IoT use case has its own measurable business
    benefit. A product-centric setup allows for better engagement and full ownership
    between IoT team and business units since product owners from the business side
    are part of the team delivering the IoT use case end to end. The measurable outcome
    in a product-based organization for every enhancement or new business functionality
    is based on how fast the new functionality is released to the market, how many
    new customers a new feature is able to attract, and if the customer satisfaction
    has improved after adding a new feature to the overall product. Alternatively,
    if an IoT use case is developed to increase operation efficiency, outcomes are
    measured as how much gain the product has brought to the business, such as reducing
    machine downtimes or increasing utilization of machineries in a manufacturing
    context or automatic detection of diseases with accuracy in a healthcare context.
    This measurement contrasts with traditional metrics in a project organization
    where for every new business functionality development, teams are measured on
    the number of defects in production, quality of the resources, and so on. Traditional
    metrics in product organizations do not vanish but are treated as secondary measures
    to the product success.

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we discussed about the challenges enterprises face with a project
    organization and the importance of transforming to a product-centric organization.
    We discussed that a product organization is all about delivering business outcomes
    or business value in shorter intervals, keeping in mind the market changes or
    changes within the enterprise and adapting immediately to these changes. In an
    IoT world, it is essential to think about IoT use case development with a product
    mindset rather than a project mindset.

- en: Subsequently, we discussed the five phases of an IoT use case life cycle which
    constitutes of introduction, growth, maturity, decline, and abandonment. Introduction,
    growth, and maturity are the three phases where most IoT use case development
    and enhancement happens, and this is where the Hypothesis to Cash model is applied
    for each new feature that is added to a use case. The Hypothesis to Cash model
    has four phases, namely, the hypothesis (new idea generation), funding (idea funding),
    development and test, and finally production release.

    operations. They ensure that all control and automation technologies enable seamless
    production and operation processes. OT has been intentionally separated from IT,
    and they have different people, goals, policies, and projects. This independence
    drives OT teams to be agile and efficient on the shop floor. In recent years,
    IT-OT integration has taken several industries by storm and represents a new source
    of data that can be leveraged to increase factory efficiency using IT. This new
    era of connectivity presents the OT team with many opportunities to further manage,
    automate, and optimize the shop floor and production processes. Unfortunately,
    without IT and OT team integration  , these opportunities cannot be capitalized
    upon in IoT use cases. Consider this: if shop floor data is not integrated with
    data from IT systems, operational excellence and production optimization are difficult
    to achieve since gaps in the current business process cannot be easily determined.'

    is to integrate IT and OT teams to make IoT aspiration a success for enterprises.
    As we discussed earlier, security is one of the major concerns in IoT, but this

    OT devices, and traditional data management systems simply cannot handle such
    a load. It is impossible to use traditional IT systems for real-time decision-making
    with such huge and disparate sets of data. With IoT, enterprises will have interconnected
    machines, and these machines generate a lot of data that needs to be analyzed
    in real time to give a full picture of what is happening on the floor or even
    in a single machine. For example, in a shoe manufacturing plant, the machine creating
    soles can notify the team responsible for sole stitching when there is an unexpected
    delay or backlog, allowing them to switch to other tasks while maintenance is
    carried out. This facility-wide visibility is simply impossible without data connectivity,
    and as such having a big data platform is a must for enterprises embarking on
    an IoT journey. As we discussed in Chapter [11](517610_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml),
    with a big data platform enterprises will be able to bring in all kinds of data
    from the operational equipment and create a centralized IoT network. Subsequently,
    this network can be connected with the existing IT to generate insights.

    to manipulate them and steal money and data. OT environments today face similar
    challenges when connecting industrial control system (ICS) technologies to the
    Internet. Until recently, OT was interconnected with proprietary, vendor-based
    closed connections and protocols that could not be accessed remotely. Now that
    ICS technologies are moving toward exposing themselves to the Internet, IT security
    challenges have become part of OT environments. This is one of the reasons why
    security considerations should be planned from day one in IoT, and a security

    that have built-in security features, and shortlisting capable IoT device vendors
    who manufacture those devices, is another important role a security advisor performs.

    target IoT devices using the Gateway. The security advisor disagreed for these
    devices to be used in a as it is version and recommended new devices to be procured
    to continue development. We brought new devices from Particle IO which is a widely

    been able to reduce their product release cycle time from months to (literally)
    days. This has enabled them to grow and lead in fast-paced, emerging markets,
    and IoT is one area where [DevSecOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) brings
    in a lot of value. Companies like Google, Amazon, and many others now release
    software many times per day. By improving the quality and cycle time of product
    releases and with the introduction of security in DevOps, DevSecOps has gained
    in popularity and been a great success for a number of enterprises in IoT product
    development. Traditionally, what happens in the legacy world is that developers
    create their code and pass it to quality assurance or testing teams, who then
    test the code, identify any bugs, and pass it back to developers. Developers will
    then fix the code and return it for more testing, before it is handed over to
    the operations teams for support and maintenance of the product. This is a common
    practice which is followed in a waterfall development methodology. An agile software
    development process also partly follows this model with an exception that developers
    and testers within the development cycle work in tandem without any handoffs,
    although handoffs are still passed to the operations team after testing for deployment.
    This clearly shows a lack of collaboration between development, testing, and deployment
    teams, which ultimately leads to a slow development and deployment cycle. DevSecOps
    eliminates this challenge completely since there is only one team for development,
    security, and operations, and therefore there are no handoffs.
