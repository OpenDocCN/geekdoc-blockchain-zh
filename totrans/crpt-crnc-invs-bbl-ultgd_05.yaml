- en: People dealing with cryptocurrency use a wallet as a safe depository and an
    instrument for incoming and outgoing payments. Let's analyze the available types
    of wallets and choose the most suitable one based on your computer's resources
    and tasks.

- en: There are hot and cold wallets. There are also warm wallets, but they are used
    much less often. Cold wallets are used to store money, while hot wallets are used
    to send and receive the currency quickly.

- en: As a rule, a wallet has a Private key and a Public key. The Private key belongs
    only to you, and you should never show it to anyone. You must keep it in mind
    as you sign all transactions with this key. At the same time, someone can use
    public keys to transfer money to your account, for example, for a new Ferrari
    car . In such a case, you should give this person your public key. This key can
    even be published on social networks. There is nothing to worry about here.

- en: Bitcoin Сore will be the very first wallet to consider. It is the original Bitcoin
    wallet from the legendary Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. It is the only officially
    supported wallet which is constantly updated by the professional Bitcoin community
    and stores the entire Bitcoin database on your computer, automatically supporting
    the network. Bitcoin Сore is highly secure and user-friendly. However, I do not
    recommend installing this wallet on your computer. The first synchronization takes
    a very long time, and the size of a fully synchronized wallet reaches 100 GB,
    which is a significant drawback.

- en: I consider Blockchain to be the ideal wallet for users, especially lazy ones.
    It does not require the installation of third-party applications on the computer.
    It allows you to create a Bitcoin wallet within seconds and use it immediately.
    This wallet guarantees a high level of safety for your Bitcoin, enjoys an impeccable
    reputation, and offers 24/7 support. The interface is simple and intuitive, even
    for beginners. The theoretical disadvantage lies only in the fact that your Bitcoin
    wallet is located on a third-party resource, not on your computer.

    for participation in ICOs (Initial Coin Offering). We’ll go through ICOs later
    in the book, but for now, it’s only important to know that it’s very similar to
    an IPO.

    to transfer money to, indicate the sum, and transfer it. This wallet is called
    "warm" because it contains a file you need to download to your computer and only
    then enter a login for your wallet.'

    there are quite a lot of them for other cryptocurrencies.

    storing money, making transactions, for one-time use only.'

- en: For example, you can store Ethereum and all ICO tokens related to it on the
    MyEtherWallet wallet. I also recommend using the Mist wallet when dealing with
    Ethereum, though it takes much time to download it to a computer. There are also
    multi-currency wallets that support several cryptocurrencies such as Metamask
    and Jaxx.

- en: Assuming that you want to learn how to store cryptocurrency correctly, I will
    dwell in more detail on the issue of cold storage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Cold storage is a term referring to private keys, which are usually created
    and stored in a secure, isolated environment. This means that your money will
    not be located on any site. This wallet looks like a USB flash drive: you can
    connect it to a computer and make a transaction quickly.'

- en: This method is very popular for storing a significant amount of funds in cryptocurrency.
    Transactions are seldom performed, and security is one of the top priorities.
    Therefore, the cold storage suits you the best if you decide to hold your funds
    for the long haul.

    Bitcoin debit cards.

- en: The essence of these cards is also quite simple. You register a wallet on the
    site and transfer bitcoins to it. After that, the service sends your Bitcoin debit
    card, linked to your mobile phone number, to the indicated address. It is very
    convenient to pay for purchases using this card. However, I warn you that this
    method of storage is not cheap. Each time you pay with this card, there’s a fee
    of about 3%. Therefore, this method of storing Bitcoin is not entirely suitable
    for daily use. However, this card is the perfect choice for people who get their
    salary paid in Bitcoin and want to pay for their purchases with this card anywhere
    in the world.

    a certain level of risk. Take the same approach as with your bank cards: do not
    store all your money on a single bank card. You need hot wallets to add money
    to your account on the cryptocurrency exchange and to make transactions. They
    are also used to participate in the ICO. However, I recommend you hold most of
    your money in a cold wallet. It is not connected to the Internet so it cannot
    be hacked, which makes it way more secure.'

    it with two-factor authentication, and, most importantly, write down all your
    passwords on paper.
