    Mumbai Industrial Corridor, which is a 620-mile (1,000km) stretch between Delhi

    many blockchain startups out of NYC. The license itself costs $5,000 and can be
    up to 500 pages. It requires the fingerprints of each company’s leaders and an
    extensive background check on the applying businesses. The chief complaint is
    the roughly $100,000 in expenses associated with the application. This estimate
