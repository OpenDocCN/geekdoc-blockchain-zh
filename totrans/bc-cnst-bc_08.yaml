- en: The UK (United Kingdom) government published a guidance document in 2012 stipulating
    the use of project bank accounts (PBA) to promote fair and prompt payment practices
    in the construction industry. This article provides a high-level conceptual model
    utilising blockchain to automate project bank account payments. In PBA, project
    funds are partitioned in a separate bank account, like an escrow. Traditionally,
    before PBA, the main contractor would use the client’s project payments to reinvest
    in new work, or strategically withhold supply chain payments to sustain positive
    cash flow. PBA revokes the main contractor as the sole recipient of the project
    budget and provides the client with transparency over project expenditures. The
    proposed conceptual model allows project participants to approve and execute automated
    payments through user dashboards. Part of the security of smart contracts is their
    unchangeable properties once deployed; however, this is problematic, as construction
    projects regularly undergo change orders and programme alterations. Furthermore,
    Ethereum-based smart contracts in the current environment are limited due to the
    costs associated with auditing and on-chain hosting fees. To mitigate this, transactions
    in the PBA blockchain model are instantiated through an off-chain application,
    which stores pre-executed transactions in the form of signed messages. These messages
    are pushed to the blockchain and converted to transactions once they are approved
    by validating authorities. The result is a strategy to achieve payment automation
    at a more economical cost. The proposed model illustrates a high-level amalgamation
    of PBA, blockchain, off-chain, and asset tokenization. A limitation of this article
    is that it does not include any programming and the ideas are presented in the
    form of a flowchart. Future work includes programming the solution.

- en: The construction industry is known for having bad payment practices like overextended
    periods of delayed payments [[1](#CR1)]. Furthermore, the industry is still recuperating
    from the pertaining effects of the 2008 financial crisis, which left many construction
    companies with elevated capital expenditure, increased competition, and greater
    exposure to financial uncertainty [[2](#CR2)]. Commercial solutions to mitigate
    this include parent company guarantees, collateral warranties, and counterparty
    risk assessments [[3](#CR3)]. However, these do not address the primary concern
    of reducing delayed payments. Solving this problem would increase the stability
    of the industry by improving liquidity and reducing supply chain insolvencies,
    which leads to increased trust and reduced project risk [[4](#CR4)]. Data from
    the UK National Office of statistics in 2019 suggested that for every large company
    in the construction industry, there are on average 1000 small and medium enterprises
    [[5](#CR5)]. This imbalance creates over-competition and forces subcontractors
    to accept unfair contractual conditions, such as high-risk work for less pay [[6](#CR6)].

    From a structural perspective, the risk of collapse is linked to public safety;
    therefore, by default, safety standards are high [[7](#CR7)]. From a financial
    perspective, innovation is challenging due to low margins, which results in the
    overuse of legacy systems [[8](#CR8)]. Lack of innovation in technology systems
    is the principal contributor to poor productivity, adversarial supply chain relationships,
    and negative workflow fragmentation [[9](#CR9)]. Neighbouring industries such
    as manufacturing have managed to increase efficiencies annually throughout many
    generations, resulting in progressive productivity year after year [[10](#CR10)].
    Due to a lack of innovation, infrastructure projects are on average 80% over budget
    and 20% behind schedule; furthermore, productivity has been declining since 1990
    [[11](#CR11)]. Construction also suffers from a lack of transparency in company
    reports, whereby, stakeholders are subjected to inaccurate feedback on the state
    of a project [[12](#CR12)].

    industry to build more with less, whilst in a skills shortage [[13](#CR13)]. Additionally,
    the industry is facing pressure to incorporate smart technologies and decarbonization
    solutions throughout the lifecycle of built assets [[14](#CR14)]. The demand for
    digital reform is required to meet the industrial dependencies of the modern economy
    [[15](#CR15)]. Blockchain includes the potential to increase efficiencies in multiple
    areas, such as payments, data management, automation, and systems integration
    [[16](#CR16)]. However, blockchain alone cannot be relied upon to drive the digital
    revolution. It is one of many components that need to work in harmony as part
    of an ecosystem of technology services.

    was in 2005, through a joint venture between the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD)
    and the main contractor, which was created to ensure the auditability of government
    funds throughout an entire project [[17](#CR17)]. The UK government PBA guidance
    document was published in 2012, which discussed the partitioning of the project
    account away from the contractor to mitigate against cash farming and cascading
    payments down each tier of the supply chain [[18](#CR18)]. Cash farming is when
    a contractor unfairly withholds payments to their supply chain to improve internal
    cash flow.

    to automate the processing of supply chain payments, without having to use an
    intermediary to manage the PBA. In the proposed model, the partitioned account
    is represented by an off-chain database that controls the release of funds from
    the client to the supply chain. The PBA blockchain model attempts to bypass hosting
    on-chain (on the blockchain) smart contracts to mitigate transaction fees, development
    costs, and recoding when projects undergo change orders. The off-chain database
    is used to store pre-executed transactions that covert to transactions at a later
    point in time. This article provided a high-level process flow of the PBA blockchain
    model and the responsibilities of each transacting party.

    were documented in the 1964 Banwell Report [[19](#CR19)], authored by Sir Harold
    Banwell, who was tasked with documenting the state of the industry. The construction
    industry is a large contributor to global GDP (Gross Domestic Product); however,
    it can increase its contribution further through innovating longstanding and outdated
    processes [[20](#CR20)]. The industry is particularly known for having a lack
    of trust caused by poor procurement practices, cash flow, and lack of collaboration
    [[21](#CR21)]. As a result, clients are hesitant to take on new work due to undisclosed
    risks and tight margins, which results in projects being selected based on low
    cost rather than long-term value [[22](#CR22)]. Innovation remains a perpetuating
    problem despite advancements in digital solutions such as building information
    modelling (BIM) [[23](#CR23)].

    fragmented systems that do not integrate efficiently [[24](#CR24)]. These systems
    make it difficult to accurately report the state of a project with transparency
    and traceability [[24](#CR24)]. Despite this, the industry is pushing towards
    greater standardisation to increase productivity through bodies such as the International
    Standard Organisation (ISO), Industry Foundation Class (IFC) by building Smart,
    and governmental mandates that support digital tools such as BIM [[25](#CR25)].

- en: The construction industry is dominated by a small selection of main contractors
    who provide work for many small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which causes over-competition
    amongst SMEs and provides main contractors with controlling authority over the
    supply chain [[26](#CR26)]. SMEs are forced to accept unfair contractual conditions
    with overextended payment terms due to the hierarchical nature of the industry;
    whereby, contractors exercise *cash farming* techniques and *pay when paid* clauses
    [[4](#CR4)]. Cash farming is a strategy implemented by contractors to improve
    internal cash flow at the cost of delayed payments to their supply chain, furthermore,
    it allows the project budget to be used for investing in new work rather than
    paying outstanding debts [[27](#CR27)]. Despite the benefits of cash farming to
    contractors, it is the primary cause of SME insolvencies [[28](#CR28)]. Data from
    the Office of National Statistics suggest that the average quantity of individual
    insolvencies in the UK construction industry is recorded at 2595 cases annually,
    which accounts for 18% of the overall insolvent population in the UK and is the
    highest across all other industries [[29](#CR29)]. The danger of bad cash flow
    management is exemplified by the insolvency of Carillion, who in 2017 was the
    second-largest construction company in the UK (based on turnover); however, at
    the time of liquidation in 2018, it owed GBP 1.3 billion worth of unpaid liabilities
    to SMEs [[30](#CR30)]. From 2009 to 2018, Carillion’s debt increased from GBP
    242 million to GBP 1.3 billion; furthermore, they imposed payment terms of 120 days
    to SMEs, which is four times the duration of what is typically agreed in construction
    contracts in the UK [[31](#CR31)].

    mediation, which is a lightweight process that involves an impartial third party
    to manage and settle the dispute; however, large companies can enforce costlier
    methods against unsatisfactory settling, through methods such as litigation [[32](#CR32)].
    This places SMEs at a disadvantage because payments to the supply chain are withheld
    until a court settlement takes place, which can take over 12 months to process
    [[32](#CR32)]. Countries such as France and Australia include regulations that
    allow SMEs to request overdue payments directly from the client; furthermore,
    Japan includes severe governmentally enforced penalties on construction companies
    that impose unfair payment terms [[33](#CR33)].

    promote fair payment practices. A common trend in this includes how to protect
    small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from unfair contract conditions, through the
    incorporation of reduced payment terms and requesting that contractors provide
    promissory notes as proof of goodwill to their supply chain. These legislations
    are variants of the same solution, as the payment problem remains unsolved and
    different approaches are incorporated. The UK Government has requested that some
    of these listed legislations be compulsory; however, construction companies in
    the UK continue to treat these as advisory documents due to a lack of governmental
    oversight. The following is an overview of several payment legislations that are
    currently active in the UK.

    invoices that have been left unpaid for 30 days [[39](#CR39)]. However, this does
    not include a 30-day checking period, therefore, contractors can strategically
    delay payments for up to 60-days before interest is charged (30 days to check

    was in 2005, through a joint venture between a public sector client (UK Defence
    Estates) and a main contractor; furthermore, the PBA was set up due to the adversarial
    nature of the construction industry and the client having a trusted relationship
    with their SMEs [[17](#CR17)]. The result was successful, with the PBA managing
    all payments to subcontractors on time and within the agreed budget; furthermore,
    all expenditures were openly auditable throughout the entire construction process
    [[17](#CR17)]. According to the UK Office of Government Commerce report on PBA
    implementation, clients can save up to 2.5% on public sector projects [[45](#CR45)]*.*
    PBA was trialed in the public sector between 2012 and 2015 and was used to manage
    over GBP 4 billion worth of work [[18](#CR18)]. In 2013, the Northern Ireland
    government has mandated PBA in construction projects worth over GBP 1 million
    GBP; similarly, in the same year, Wales mandated the use of PBA in projects worth
    over GBP 2 million [[46](#CR46)].

    to protect themselves against legal disputes [[47](#CR47)]. A barrier to SMEs
    requesting PBA in contracts is the fear of potential reprisal from main contractors,
    which may include exclusion from future work [[48](#CR48)]. In a questionnaire
    conducted by PhD researchers Rachel Griffiths and Wayne Lord from Loughborough
    University on the topic of PBA adoption, consisting of a total sample of 58 respondents
    from the construction supply chain, 42% voted *fear of reprisal* as the principal
    factor preventing the adoption of PBA, followed by 34% *legal expenses*, and 25%
    *culture of the industry* [[49](#CR49)]. Additionally, standard forms of contracts
    include various certifications, valuations, and compliance checks that require
    amending to suit the implementation of PBA; however, the interviewees suggested
    these as non-technical barriers [[49](#CR49)]. Furthermore, the UK governmental
    department Cabinet Office asserted that PBA would not cause interference with
    contract valuations and certifications [[50](#CR50)].

    working practices [[50](#CR50)]. Progress on the uptake of PBA in existing contracts
    such as NEC, JCT, and FIDIC has steadily increased; however, PBA is challenging
    to enforce across all built environment contracts due to the diverse and bespoke
    nature of construction projects [[51](#CR51)]. A similar variant to PBA emerged
    in Canada, called the Ontario Construction Lien Act, which discussed using a multi-project
    bank account [[52](#CR52)]. Whereby, a partitioned bank account is used for executing
    payments across multiple projects [[53](#CR53)]. The payment duration for this
    is 28 days from the client to the contractor and seven days from the contractor
    to the subcontractors; however, it permits a *paid when paid* clause, thus is
    prone to delays caused by cascading payments down the supply chain [[54](#CR54)].
    Furthermore, it suffers from liability and trust issues regarding the appointment
    of an account manager that can oversee private/sensitive data across multiple
    projects.

    directly to signed approvals, through smart contracts that automate the release
    of payments to the supply chain [[55](#CR55)]. Benefits include reduced delays
    caused by administrative processing, and increased transaction traceability [[56](#CR56)].
    Payments can be automated through preprogrammed functions that control the execution
    of transactions; furthermore, these codified instructions can be audited by regulatory
    controls to ensure compliance with government-enforced legislation [[57](#CR57)].
    The inbuilt properties of blockchain, such as immutability and data trust, make
    it a suitable medium for value transfer, which provides a reliable data trail
    in the event of dispute resolution [[58](#CR58)]. Data stored on the blockchain
    can be relayed into enterprise systems through an application programming interface
    (API) that integrates blockchain with legacy systems [[59](#CR59)]. For example,
    services that are typically managed across various IT systems such as asset ownership
    certificates, accounting data, and signed contract agreements can potentially
    be integrated through a blockchain-based system [[60](#CR60)].

    cryptography), which comprises the use of a public–private key pair [[61](#CR61)]*.*
    These keys serve two main functions, encryption, and signatures [[62](#CR62)].
    The public key is the digital address that is used for receiving funds (like the
    account number written on a person’s bank card), while the private key provides
    the authority to execute transactions from a user’s wallet (like a person’s card
    number on their bank card) [[63](#CR63)]. Due to asymmetric encryption, public
    keys can be shared openly without the risk of revealing their associated private
    key [[64](#CR64)]. It was invented in 1976 and is the evolution of symmetric encryption
    [[65](#CR65)]. Symmetric encryption uses only one key to encrypt and decrypt data,
    while asymmetric encryption uses two keys, a public–private key pair [[66](#CR66)]*.*

    application that is used ubiquitously across blockchain is a decentralised exchange
    (DEX), which allows users to trade currencies peer-to-peer without a centralised
    exchange. Decentralised applications such as DEXs mitigate against hacks, provide
    lower transaction fees, and allows users to trade peer-to-peer [[122](#CR122)].
    DEXs include a unique property, whereby, the public keys of transacting parties
    are not required to perform the trade, therefore, swaps take place anonymously
    [[124](#CR124)]. The off-chain features of a DEX are adapted and implemented into

    to 100,000 each [[74](#CR74)]. The number of smart contracts required to fully
    automate payments in a construction project can realistically reach thousands,
    due to the volume of participants and activities involved in a typical project.
    Additionally, including more technical features into a smart contract simultaneously
    increases its cost, thus there is a level of diminishing returns that applies
    to smart contracts as they increase in complexity [[75](#CR75)].

    transaction is a signed message which states the intention to send cryptocurrency
    from one person to another [[76](#CR76)]. However, this intent can be stored off-chain
    and is the basis of the proposed dApp. The rules that permit the release of messages
    to the blockchain would be governed by conditions pre-programmed into an off-chain
    database. The conditions would be openly auditable for all users to verify its
    terms and conditions before entering blockchain-based agreements. A downside to
    using off-chain as opposed to on-chain is the higher rate of centralization [[77](#CR77)].
    To increase security, the PBA dApp would need to be hosted by many nodes to revoke
    any one party from having controlling authority over the dApp. The most practical
    selection of participants would be the ones directly involved in the project,
    such as the client and the supply chain. External participants of the dApp could
    include banks, governmental authorities, and standards organizations.

    that a payer wishes to send cryptocurrency from their wallet to a recipient. However,
    these messages can be instantiated and managed off-chain, which is the purpose
    of the proposed application. The intention is to use signed messages that include
    instructions to execute project payments to the supply chain participants upon
    validated completion of works. Each message would be signed with the account holder’s
    private key, which provides the authorization for the message to convert to a
    transaction when it is uploaded to the blockchain [[81](#CR81)]. Furthermore,
    signed messages can be used in conjunction with a promissory note, which provides
    evidence of the client’s intention to make fair payments. The message signing
    process is displayed in Fig. [1](#Fig1) and is numerically annotated to discuss
    the sequential steps of the message signing function.

    of the PBA blockchain model is taken from a decentralised application. It includes
    payment conditions preprogrammed into a blockchain application to automate the
    execution of payments to the supply chain. The proposed PBA blockchain model assumes
    that banks have adopted blockchain and can offer payment guarantees through tokenised
    collateral; however, the readiness of banks to provide blockchain services to
    the construction industry requires further research [[110](#CR110)]. If banks
    are reluctant to assist in providing guarantees, opportunities exist with decentralised
    finance (DeFi), and asset tokenisation through collateral-backed lending [[111](#CR111)].
    However, the technical aspect of DeFi for enterprise is in the conceptualisation
    and testing stage and requires regulatory maturity. Furthermore, insuring against
    blockchain-related risks is difficult to forecast in the current environment due
    to the nascency of the technology. This disincentivizes an already risk-averse
    construction industry. DeFi came into fruition in 2020, and in the same year,
    a USD 25 million USD hack of a DeFi platform took place, which was untraceable
    due to the pseudonymous nature of public blockchains [[112](#CR112)]. Collateral
    lending through DeFi is currently only available for peer-to-peer borrowing/lending,

    auditing and education company, the estimated cost for auditing a smart contract
    can range from USD 4000 to 100,000 each, depending on how advanced the coding
    is [[74](#CR74)]. While iOlite, a non-profit organisation for smart contract technologies,
    estimated that the cost of developing a smart contract can range from USD 7000
    to 100,000 each, based on the complexity of its business logic [[73](#CR73)].
    Furthermore, deploying smart contracts directly on the blockchain incurs hosting
    fees that need to be considered. Despite the generalised nature of these costs,
    even the lowest spectrum is uneconomically feasible, as potentially thousands
    of smart contracts would be required to fully automate payments in a construction
    project, due to the volume of participants and activities that occur in a typical

- en: From 1996 to 2021, six major UK governmental legislative documents were published
    to address the payment problem in the construction industry. From these, the project
    bank account (PBA) strategy was identified as an area that could benefit from
    the integration of blockchain. Despite its nascency, blockchain is rapidly evolving
    and changing the outlook of how businesses, people, and services operate. In a
    report which discusses the potential impact of blockchain, it was identified as
    potentially transforming 58 industries globally, which includes the construction
    industry [[121](#CR121)]. The proposed PBA blockchain model provides a high-level
    overview of how project participants could interact with a blockchain application
    to upload payment activities, validate works, and automate the execution of liabilities
    to the supply chain. The PBA model also discussed potential blockchain solutions
    regarding how to mitigate the risk of non-payment from the client, through tokenised
    collateral that can be used as a medium of exchange with a bank, thereby allowing
    the bank to automate the execution of overdue payments in exchange for collateral.

- en: The values of PBA and blockchain harmonise across several key attributes such
    as transparency, auditability, and disintermediation. However, this study requires
    further investigation through developing and codifying the proposed PBA blockchain
    application and simulating its process flows. Additionally, interviews with industry
    practitioners knowledgeable in PBA would provide constructive criticism on areas
    within the proposed model that were overlooked, such as formal decision processes
    that are required in setting up the PBA.
