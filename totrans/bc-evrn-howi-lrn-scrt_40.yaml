    table to talk about blockchain. Then trying to squeeze my own Ping-Pong table
    into my tiny electric car. Getting quotes for Ping-Pong table delivery. I had
    been practicing for weeks! But Ping-Pong is a game of finesse, not force. Accepting
    defeat, I prepared a Ping-Pong video instead.

    MIT Sloan School of Management, a school that had minted its fair share of tech
    millionaires. Blockchain investing was all the rage in China, all the more so
    because Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) had recently been banned by the Chinese
    government.

    why I was standing in a lecture hall at MIT, speaking to a small room of wealthy

    I was bringing up Ping-Pong.

    great nations, and the danger is that we fall into another cold war like the one
    that existed between us during the 1950s and 1960s.” I acted like I was in China,

    off against Japan’s world champion, Jun Mizutani. The volleys grow more and more
    frenetic, with both opponents several feet from the table, swinging their paddles
    full force, the ball a blur. Then Ma Long goes in for a final return, checks himself,
    and the ball misses the table by inches. Ma Long’s point. The crowd on the video
    goes berserk, and even in the room people caught their breath.

    in the form of town meetings. These are regular meetings, held since our town
    was founded in the 1600s, where the townspeople meet to vote on policy and budgets.
  prefs: []

    call him Lester—who has opinions on every topic imaginable. At one town meeting,
    there was discussion on what the animal control department should do about the
    gophers.

    and Lester never misses an opportunity. “Gophers are evil!” he proclaimed. “They
    dig up your yard, chew up your grass, they mate and lay their babies in your holes.
    Get yourself a shotgun!”

    and in fact only one stoplight.) Could the highway department cut down a large,
    rotting stump? A woman—I’ll call her Dolores—fought for that stump as if it were
    a memorial to her dead husband.

    or indeed any rodent, ever.

    network runs too slowly and uses too much power, and it costs too much to make
    a transaction. It needs an upgrade, but what’s the best path forward?

    in time—parallel realities, if you will.
