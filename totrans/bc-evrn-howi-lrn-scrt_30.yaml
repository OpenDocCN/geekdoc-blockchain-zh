    TechLab!

- en: One of the world’s oldest offices, the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of London
    is an elected position that serves to represent and promote businesses and individuals
    in London. The Lord Mayor, along with a delegation of banking and financial leaders,
    was stopping by our incubator to learn about blockchain.

- en: We had prepared exhaustively for the event, lining up a panel of Boston’s best
    and brightest. I had been up all night prepping my presentation. I was making
    last-minute arrangements with the team in TechLab’s common area, where the caterers
    were setting out food, when Benedict approached me.

- en: “Let’s make sure this room is a hive of activity today,” I instructed the team
    as I stood up. “And have the photographer get pictures over to Cliff for sharing
    on social media ASAP.” I turned to Benedict, who weirdly was not smiling. “Big
    day!” I exclaimed, clapping him on the shoulder.

    no smile. This was bad.

    I was contacted by TechLab offices in Silicon Valley and London. They both want
    to build blockchain hubs in their locations.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    value of TechLab.” I pulled out my Moleskine notebook. “You know how we have TechLab
    credits, right?”
  prefs: []

    use to book conference rooms or buy food at any TechLab worldwide. That is a currency.
    We already have our own currency! The idea is to put TechLab credits on the blockchain,
    to make it a digital currency.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If blockchain is a technology that lets us share value, how about letting us
    share all those valuable rewards points? Frequent-flier miles, coffee cards, shopping
    points—these are all “virtual currencies,” little economic systems that businesses
    create to encourage your loyalty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You probably have a wallet full of these cards. Coffee points: Buy nine coffees,
    get the tenth one free. Supermarket points. Gas points. Retailer points. Credit
    card points.'
  prefs: []

- en: What if we set all these points free?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine you’re trying to book a holiday with frequent-flier points. You have
    40,000 points but you need 50,000 to buy the ticket. The airline will sell you
    10,000 at a ridiculous price, but what if you could buy the points on a public
    market?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Better yet, what if these rewards points were interchangeable? What if you could
    give up 10,000 of your supermarket points and receive 10,000 frequent-flier points
    in return?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Behind the scenes, a blockchain (we’ll call it RewardChain) will “buy” the 10,000
    supermarket points from you, then transfer them into a common token (we’ll call
    it RewardCoin). Then you use your RewardCoin to purchase the 10,000 points you
    need for your flight.

    to transfer points between each other. But the rewards of RewardChain will outweigh
    the risks: every retailer who participates in a decentralized marketplace like
    RewardChain gets exposed to more shoppers. It’s like a mall.'

- en: To be sure, retailers will have to carefully manage the redemption rates for
    their loyalty points so they don’t lose money giving away free coffee and free
    flights. It won’t be easy, but those who figure it out first will be amply rewarded.

    a number at the bottom.

    placing a pen in front of me.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    studio. You are constantly doing things without permission. You act like you own
    this place.”

    a confidentiality clause. So you want to pay me off in exchange for my silence?”

    biggest mistake of your career?”

    ways.”

  prefs: []

    of London is due to arrive in a few minutes. They are looking at best practices
    for starting their own blockchain incubator. So if you would like to make the
    blockchain presentation, then be my guest.”

    the end of the day.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Where would we go? How would we rebuild? This blockchain incubator, lovingly built
    to nurture these little eggs, had been flash-frozen. Because Benedict had unplugged
    the power cord.
  prefs: []

- en: I brushed away tears and steeled myself for the two-hour seminar on blockchain,
    one of the most important moments of my professional career. My voice choked as
    I ironically rehearsed my opening line. “This is the greatest time to be alive.”
