    leaders. “The purpose of our fact-finding meeting today is to gather information.

    investments, the Securities Act of 1933 created a special class of accredited
    investors. To qualify today, you must have a net worth of at least $1 million
    (your house doesn’t count), or make at least $200,000 per year.

    dropped. The market cooled. That trickle began to freeze.
