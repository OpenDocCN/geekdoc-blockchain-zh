    ComputingConsensusPrior to examining the implications and applications of blockchain
    technology on the financial services landscape and practitioners employed therein,
    it does appear appropriate to, at least at first, acknowledge the importance of
    cryptocurrencies on the broader conversation. Beginning during 2017, and accelerated
    during the fourth quarter mirroring the rise in price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,
    the amount of interest and investment in the broader cryptocurrency area attracted
    the attention of both individuals and institutions. While the cryptocurrency applications
    and use cases are only a part of the wider blockchain conversation and analysis,
    it may very well be the most high profile example of how blockchain entered the
    market lexicon. Drilling down and taking into account just what cryptocurrencies
    are, what they are not, and what they may mean for the financial services landscape
    appears to be an appropriate first step toward understanding how emerging technology
    forces are driving the profession forward.![../images/467992_1_En_3_Chapter/467992_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_3_Chapter/467992_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png)

    completely contradictory to the current financial market system. Currently, the
    forces of centralization appear to dominate virtually every aspect of the finance
    and business landscape – governments, banks, financial institutions, market regulators,
    and payment processing organizations. Even paying online, via a mobile device,
    or from logging into a payment processing VPN does not represent a difference
    from traditional centralized processing and verification. In addition to forming
    a central clearinghouse for the processing of individual payments between individuals
    and institutions, there is also the data and identify verification that accompanies
    the payment process. Although organizations, ranging from Google to Netflix to
    the array of financial institutions that dominate the payment and saving landscape,
    have invested billions of dollars and put thousands of people to work in these
    areas, the frequency and severity of data breaches and hacks continues to increase
    over time.

    fiat and centralized currency and payment options, but in that context the broader
    cryptocurrency conversation has failed in the initial value proposition of this
    asset class. Due to the complexity of how the underlying technology works (more
    on blockchain shortly), actually using cryptocurrencies as a currency remains
    difficult. In addition to the slow processing that continues to plague many of
    the highest profile cryptocurrency options in the marketplace, actually using
    these items as a medium of exchange continues to be a work in progress. Rather,
    these items and assets have been, for the time being, used primarily as an investment
    option or tool similar to equity securities or commodities. This shift and development
    from a currency tool to an investment tool and option represents a fundamental
    change in how investors and institutions approach this situation. Figure [3.1](#Fig1)
    highlights and shows some of the core issues that continue to arise for accounting
    and financial services professionals connected to the treatment, reporting, and
    custody of cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets.

    the development and rollout of stablecoins, payment channels, lightning networks,
    and other emerging cryptocurrency tools, the rise of cryptocurrencies appears
    to be continuing virtually unabated. While the runup in prices associated with
    numerous cryptocurrencies and coins may have attracted the interest and attention
    of investors, even following the decline in prices during 2018 the levels of interest
    and investment appear to be continuing. Even with this increased level of interest
    and investment, however, an important question remains unanswered; should cryptocurrency
    be classified as an asset or as a currency item, which will drive further conversations
    (Parashar and Rasiwala [2019](#CR9)). Different cryptocurrencies have been developed
    for different areas of the economy, and specialized coins have even been introduced
    for distinct industry applications. That said, and acknowledging the rapid increase
    in in interest and development of the cryptocurrency space, it is important to
    recognize the following reality. Blockchain may appear to be the unsexy foundation
    that powers cryptocurrenices, but that foundation is what powers the entire cryptocurrency
    space.

- en: Few technology tools or platforms have managed to generate more buzz, analysis,
    debate, and conversation than blockchain, especially since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    burst onto the scene in 2016 and 2017\. Every accounting and finance conference,
    regardless of their geographic location, will inevitably have blockchain in the
    top 2 or 3 topics to be discussed and examined. Books, articles, podcasts, videos,
    and seminar series are also proliferating throughout the marketplace, so it is
    easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of opinions, conversations, and debates
    surrounding this technology. That said, it can also be just as easy to feel like
    it is too late to jump on, what seems like, the blockchain express as it barrels
    through the marketplace. An example of this is represented by the continuing lack
    of clarify and certainty with regards to how blockchain intersects with both accounting
    and other enterprise technology tools (Barnes [2018](#CR1)). This combination,
    the virtually limitless amount of information and the variety of opinions on the
    topic, can also lead to confusion and a misunderstanding of just what blockchain
    technology represents. Although the technology itself is comprised of facets and
    functions that, by themselves, are not particularly new or innovative, the combination
    of technology is what drives the innovation and business case generating such
    high levels of excitement. Before an objective conversation can be had about the
    potential for blockchain in the financial services landscape, an analysis must
    be conducted of what exactly blockchain is, what the core components of this platform
    are, and what those core components actually mean.

    was developed or introduced to the marketplace, but in order to grasp just how
    powerful this technology is for the financial services landscape, financial services
    professionals must understand just why this technology exists. An origin story
    of blockchain and bitcoin would not be complete if the first chapter began in
    2016, 2015, or even 2010, but rather it should begin in the 1980s. Beginning and
    growing out of the cypherpunk movement of 1980s, the movement that blended together
    both a libertarian political perspective and computer science expertise, the trend
    toward a digital and decentralized currency began to grow. Many attempts were
    launched during the 1980s and 1990s, seizing on the growing proliferation and
    integration of the internet into business practices. Ironically enough, especially
    given the fact that bitcoin itself may seek to disrupt the current financial system,
    some of the earliest developers and proponents of cryptocurrencies were financial
    institutions.

    in their attempts to develop a digital and decentralized method of transmitting
    financial information across geographic and political boundaries. Said failures
    were not the result of a lack of technical expertise, vision, or ability, but
    rather were linked to a fundamental flaw in how the internet interacts with the
    financial system. Put simply, and boiling down all extraneous data and information,
    the internet is extremely efficient and effective at the following two functions.
    First, creating copies of information for distribution lies at the core of the
    true value that the internet providers to both individuals and institutions. The
    ability to distribute information across the world in, literally, the blink of
    eye completely transformed how commerce is conducted. On top of the rather obvious
    implications for data transmission, the way in which this data was communicated
    between different individuals and institutions was already permanently transformed
    by the proliferation of the internet. Even with these possibilities, however,
    the internet by itself only obtained paradigm shifting levels of adoption when
    personal computers become more widespread (more on this later).

    that had been copied, and resend it or post it back to other users as new versions
    was a game changer. Think of a simple email attachment, be it a slide deck, word
    document, or excel worksheet that is able to transmitted back and forth between
    different actors, with everyone (for the most part) having the ability to make
    changes, relabel, and reattach this document. While this might come in handy for
    making changes to files in a workplace setting, or for editing media files, this
    exposes a core problem with the idea of a decentralized monetary unit or unit
    of exchange. The following point cannot be over emphasized, or stated as something
    that is of minor importance. In order for bitcoin or any other aspect of the cryptocurrency
    to exist, much less achieve the level of excitement and investor interest that
    currently dominates the marketplace, the underlying blockchain technology must
    have been operational first.

    and cryptocurrency technology is that without blockchain, the entire cryptocurrency
    economy and landscape would not exist (Limón [2018](#CR6)). The “crypto” in cryptocurrency

    technology had not been fully developed. Remember, and that in face of the buzz
    and excitement that currently dominates most conversations surrounding blockchain
    this can be difficult to remember, none of the core technologies embedded and
    that drive blockchain are necessarily new or innovative. The movement and shift
    toward a digital and decentralized currency has been underway for decades, and
    the technology used to anchor bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a result of
    that. Let’s take a look at some of these foundational technologies and how they

    service professionals first encountered and became engaged with blockchain technology
    was via Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, or other altcoins. Understanding both the risks
    and opportunities connected with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology at
    large is an important first step for organizations seeking to successfully integrate
    and deal with cryptocurrencies. Blockchain, however, is so much more than simply
    a methodology and technology for using cryptocurrencies; the very components that
    make blockchain technology interesting and exciting can also make the concept
    somewhat abstract and difficult to understand for some professionals. Hundreds,
    literally, of articles and books have been written that have definitions of blockchain
    included therein, but for the purposes of this conversation let’s use the following
    definition.

    applications it will, and already is, having for financial services professionals,
    is the distributed ledger technology that underpins the system. Put simply, a
    blockchain can be summarized and described as a distributed ledger system that
    allows all members access to encrypted and secure information in a near continuous
    manner. Now, this may not sound, in and of itself, revolutionary, but this encrypted
    transmission of information is augmented by the development and implementation
    of peer to peer applications. Namely, and something that will be examined in more
    depth throughout this text, the most prominent applications connected to blockchain
    technology seem to be cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

- en: Encryption and security  , as opposed to being added on from a top down manner,
    or added as a supplemental resource to be purchased or installed after the installation
    of the core software, is an embedded component of how blockchain functions. Now,
    every blockchain is different and can be constructed with different security,
    encryption, and cryptographic settings, but when having conversations with clients –
    internal and external – this is a critical point to emphasize.
  prefs: []

- en: Taking a step back to view the blockchain landscape and conversation from a
    higher level perspective, the ramifications of decentralized ledger technology
    and system are profound, including from a regulatory and data security perspective
    (Herian [2018](#CR5)). It is important to remember that the entire current construct
    and set up of the financial services landscape is a centralized model and platform.
    In addition to the payment processing and other financial transactions that will
    be transitioned and further developed, there is also the fact that core functions
    of the profession will change. Auditing, attesting to the veracity and accuracy
    of the information published and reported by the organization is a core way in
    which accounting professionals deliver value to the marketplace. As information
    is uploaded and stored on various different blockchain platforms, obtaining approval
    and consensus based verification linked to the accuracy of that data, the need
    for auditing in a traditional sense will change. Put simply, the need for auditors
    to perform tasks and engage with organizations as they currently do will either
    decrease dramatically or disappear virtually entirely. Decentralization, however,
    will not simply have impacts on accounting; finance and the process of raising
    capital will also be dramatically impacted.

- en: For example, traditional lending almost always takes place via a centralized
    model, and with the exception of an occasional gofundme campaign or other crowdfunding
    initiative or project, relies on a centralized source of capital to drive organizational
    growth. The idea of financing an organization or major business idea via a decentralized
    business model may seem radical or unorthodox to put it mildly, but will inevitably
    become more the business norm as blockchain becomes more widespread. The very
    idea of a blockchain business is to decentralize the access to information and
    data stored on the blockchain itself; whether that information happens to be financial
    information or other types of records. Decentralizing access to this information
    and data is a core principle of blockchain technology; raiding capital and securing
    the path forward for an organization is a traditional financial role that will
    inevitably result (Douaihy [2018](#CR4)). Financial professionals, whether taking
    the form of market makers themselves, or advising client organizations seeking
    to raise capital, do spend a relatively large amount of time and resources in
    this area. More pointedly, this also represents an area of the marketplace where
    financial professionals are well compensated; both the time and the compensation
    will invariably change and shift as decentralized capital raising becomes more
    normal. That said, and even with the somewhat radical nature of blockchain technology,
    it is important to realize that blockchain itself is not an innovative or new
    technology platform.

    the idea of a blockchain network to that of a cloud based computing network. Put
    simply, since the idea of a blockchain is to allow real time access to data by
    a variety of members on a continuous basis, a hardwired and centralized setup
    will simply not be appropriate. If blockchain, as it often is, represents an evolution
    of the Internet, or the development of an Internet of value, thae what the new
    internet requires is a cloud based platform. Downloading and joining the Bitcoin
    blockchain, the largest such network to date, can be done by simply downloading
    the operating program from publicly available sources. Such ease and scalability
    are traits core to the idea of blockchain technology, and also why centralized
    clearing houses such as banks and accounting firms are so interested in researching
    and developing this technology.

    Hacking, breaches, and the deluge of consumer information that had allegedly been

    Ranging from financial services institutions, to insurance companies, to food
    organizations, and social media websites, the issues associated with hacking and
    data breaches is something that cannot be overlooked. Accounting information,
    financial information, and the data and information handled by financial services
    professionals represent a virtual treasure trove of data for hackers to exploit,
    steal, and hold for ransom (EWeek [2018](#CR2)). Now, it is also important to

    warehouse or a virtual hub of data stored in a cloud environment also creates
    a centralized opportunity for hackers and other unethical actors to attack. An
    analogy that would also make sense is to imagine that, instead of criminals having
    to search an entire building to discover where the valuables are stored, they
    are told exactly where to focus their efforts and activities. Drilling down and
    expanding this concept to the blockchain conversation, the implementation of blockchain
    technology appears to address this issue with the current trend toward increased
    centralization and analysis of data. Put simply, instead of relying on a specific
    organization – no matter how technologically oriented they may be – to secure
    and protect sensitive information – there is no need to rely on a single platform
    or technology to safeguard information. Again, since encryption and cryptography
    are core components of blockchain technology – instead of an additional service
    offered after initial sale or installation – every copy of the data records are
    protected.
  prefs: []

- en: The key takeaway here is that, instead of having to safeguard, increase controls,
    and continuously increase the financial spend toward safeguarding information,
    the very nature of blockchain technology increases the security and safety around
    valuable information and data. This is not merely an academic concern nor a theoretical
    conversation; some of the largest, most sophisticated, and most well funded financial
    institutions in the world have been the victims of hacking and data losses. Equipping
    every single copy of the record with an increased security protocol in the form
    of encryption, and providing every single member of the blockchain network with
    a copy of this encrypted record is a paradigm shift. Instead of having to hack
    or gain access to simply one record or copy of the information, hackers or other
    unethical actors would have to gain access to the entirety of the records.

    to liken it to the protocol (TCP/IP) that underpins the current internet; websites
    and other portals are applications that run on this underlying technology. Cryptocurrencies
    are applications and programs that run on the blockchain, but are not one in the
    same. Just like practitioners need not understand the specifics of TCP/IP to use
    the internet, practitioners are not going to have to understand the technical
    specifications of blockchain in order to use it successfully. That said, the developing
    and increased institutional focus raises the question as to where exactly cryptocurrencies
    fit in the current investable asset landscape (Sontakke and Ghaisas [2017](#CR10)).

    responding to client and customer demands that increasingly are centered around
    real time information, blockchain does present a possible solution to current
    bottlenecks. Even with applications and advances in current technology, there
    are still significant gaps in how data is communicated and transmitted between
    supply chain partners. Applications and examples linked to how blockchain is already
    impacting the supply chain angle of the market (which accounting and financial
    professionals are part of) include some of the following:'

    of concern for virtually every individual and, important for our purposes, organization.
    IBM, a leader in the blockchain space but by no means the only player in this
    area, has launched numerous pilot projects and initiatives to assist organizations
    with tracking, verifying, and pinpointing pain points in supply chains linked
    to food transportation.

    report referenced, between 20–25% of the U.S. economy, or between $4–5 trillion
    in economic activity. Regardless of views on either the efficiency or effectiveness
    of current healthcare policies and methodologies, there does appear to be room
    for reducing errors and omissions while also increasing the efficiency of operations.

    book and discussion, the implications for financial services appear to be simultaneously
    understated and perhaps over hyped. Blockchain itself is a potentially transformative
    technology, but many financial services individual and organizations were introduced
    to this technology via the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, or other altcoins. Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies may have received headlines and market coverage, but
    blockchain itself is already the focus of billions of investment throughout the
    financial services landscape.

- en: This book may have the words blockchain and artificial intelligence in its title,
    but the most likely way that many financial practitioners were introduced to blockchain
    was via what is arguably it most well known application; cryptocurrencies. Whether
    it is bitcoin (the first and largest cryptocurrency), or one of the thousands
    of other cryptocurrencies that have entered the marketplace since 2016, it is
    certainly something that every financial services professional needs to be aware
    of and know about. These issues and developments occurring in the broader cryptocurrency
    space continue to evolve and change at an accelerating pace, including the rise
    of stablescoins, decentralized finance, and how blockchain technology intersects
    with the cryptocurrency space. Even as these technological developments accelerate
    and continue to weave into, there remain multiple areas and open items that have
    yet to be addressed for both accounting and financial reporting services. Recording
    these assets, developing services and business lines related to said assets forms
    the basis of this chapter, as well as how emerging themes and directions will
    continue to drive change in the financial services space. Topics that are introduced
    here, but are also revisited throughout the book include stablecoins, regulatory
    updates, the potential for new types of financial institutions to handle crypto
    related activities, and the implications this may have on accounting and finance
    at large. In other words, if a practitioner or a client are looking for an overview
    and introduction to the cryptocurrency landscape this chapter is a great place
    to get the information you need.
