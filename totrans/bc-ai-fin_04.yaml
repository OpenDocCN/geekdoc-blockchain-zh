    ComputingConsensusPrior to examining the implications and applications of blockchain
    technology on the financial services landscape and practitioners employed therein,
    it does appear appropriate to, at least at first, acknowledge the importance of
    cryptocurrencies on the broader conversation. Beginning during 2017, and accelerated
    during the fourth quarter mirroring the rise in price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,
    the amount of interest and investment in the broader cryptocurrency area attracted
    the attention of both individuals and institutions. While the cryptocurrency applications
    and use cases are only a part of the wider blockchain conversation and analysis,
    it may very well be the most high profile example of how blockchain entered the
    market lexicon. Drilling down and taking into account just what cryptocurrencies
    are, what they are not, and what they may mean for the financial services landscape
    appears to be an appropriate first step toward understanding how emerging technology
    forces are driving the profession forward.![../images/467992_1_En_3_Chapter/467992_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_3_Chapter/467992_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.png)

    completely contradictory to the current financial market system. Currently, the
    forces of centralization appear to dominate virtually every aspect of the finance
    and business landscape – governments, banks, financial institutions, market regulators,
    and payment processing organizations. Even paying online, via a mobile device,
    or from logging into a payment processing VPN does not represent a difference
    from traditional centralized processing and verification. In addition to forming
    a central clearinghouse for the processing of individual payments between individuals
    and institutions, there is also the data and identify verification that accompanies
    the payment process. Although organizations, ranging from Google to Netflix to
    the array of financial institutions that dominate the payment and saving landscape,
    have invested billions of dollars and put thousands of people to work in these

    fiat and centralized currency and payment options, but in that context the broader
    cryptocurrency conversation has failed in the initial value proposition of this
    asset class. Due to the complexity of how the underlying technology works (more
    on blockchain shortly), actually using cryptocurrencies as a currency remains
    difficult. In addition to the slow processing that continues to plague many of
    the highest profile cryptocurrency options in the marketplace, actually using
    these items as a medium of exchange continues to be a work in progress. Rather,
    these items and assets have been, for the time being, used primarily as an investment
    option or tool similar to equity securities or commodities. This shift and development
    from a currency tool to an investment tool and option represents a fundamental
    change in how investors and institutions approach this situation. Figure [3.1](#Fig1)
    highlights and shows some of the core issues that continue to arise for accounting
    and financial services professionals connected to the treatment, reporting, and

    the development and rollout of stablecoins, payment channels, lightning networks,
    and other emerging cryptocurrency tools, the rise of cryptocurrencies appears
    to be continuing virtually unabated. While the runup in prices associated with
    numerous cryptocurrencies and coins may have attracted the interest and attention
    of investors, even following the decline in prices during 2018 the levels of interest
    and investment appear to be continuing. Even with this increased level of interest
    and investment, however, an important question remains unanswered; should cryptocurrency
    be classified as an asset or as a currency item, which will drive further conversations
    (Parashar and Rasiwala [2019](#CR9)). Different cryptocurrencies have been developed
    for different areas of the economy, and specialized coins have even been introduced
    for distinct industry applications. That said, and acknowledging the rapid increase
    in in interest and development of the cryptocurrency space, it is important to
    recognize the following reality. Blockchain may appear to be the unsexy foundation

- en: Few technology tools or platforms have managed to generate more buzz, analysis,
    debate, and conversation than blockchain, especially since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    burst onto the scene in 2016 and 2017\. Every accounting and finance conference,
    regardless of their geographic location, will inevitably have blockchain in the
    top 2 or 3 topics to be discussed and examined. Books, articles, podcasts, videos,
    and seminar series are also proliferating throughout the marketplace, so it is
    easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of opinions, conversations, and debates
    surrounding this technology. That said, it can also be just as easy to feel like
    it is too late to jump on, what seems like, the blockchain express as it barrels
    through the marketplace. An example of this is represented by the continuing lack
    of clarify and certainty with regards to how blockchain intersects with both accounting
    and other enterprise technology tools (Barnes [2018](#CR1)). This combination,
    the virtually limitless amount of information and the variety of opinions on the
    topic, can also lead to confusion and a misunderstanding of just what blockchain
    technology represents. Although the technology itself is comprised of facets and
    functions that, by themselves, are not particularly new or innovative, the combination
    of technology is what drives the innovation and business case generating such
    high levels of excitement. Before an objective conversation can be had about the
    potential for blockchain in the financial services landscape, an analysis must
    be conducted of what exactly blockchain is, what the core components of this platform
    are, and what those core components actually mean.

    both a libertarian political perspective and computer science expertise, the trend
    toward a digital and decentralized currency began to grow. Many attempts were
    launched during the 1980s and 1990s, seizing on the growing proliferation and
    integration of the internet into business practices. Ironically enough, especially

    in their attempts to develop a digital and decentralized method of transmitting
    financial information across geographic and political boundaries. Said failures
    were not the result of a lack of technical expertise, vision, or ability, but
    rather were linked to a fundamental flaw in how the internet interacts with the
    financial system. Put simply, and boiling down all extraneous data and information,
    the internet is extremely efficient and effective at the following two functions.
    First, creating copies of information for distribution lies at the core of the
    true value that the internet providers to both individuals and institutions. The
    ability to distribute information across the world in, literally, the blink of
    eye completely transformed how commerce is conducted. On top of the rather obvious
    implications for data transmission, the way in which this data was communicated
    between different individuals and institutions was already permanently transformed
    by the proliferation of the internet. Even with these possibilities, however,
    the internet by itself only obtained paradigm shifting levels of adoption when
    personal computers become more widespread (more on this later).

    was a game changer. Think of a simple email attachment, be it a slide deck, word
    document, or excel worksheet that is able to transmitted back and forth between
    different actors, with everyone (for the most part) having the ability to make
    changes, relabel, and reattach this document. While this might come in handy for
    making changes to files in a workplace setting, or for editing media files, this
    exposes a core problem with the idea of a decentralized monetary unit or unit
    of exchange. The following point cannot be over emphasized, or stated as something
    that is of minor importance. In order for bitcoin or any other aspect of the cryptocurrency
    to exist, much less achieve the level of excitement and investor interest that
    currently dominates the marketplace, the underlying blockchain technology must

    In addition to the payment processing and other financial transactions that will
    be transitioned and further developed, there is also the fact that core functions
    of the profession will change. Auditing, attesting to the veracity and accuracy
    of the information published and reported by the organization is a core way in
    which accounting professionals deliver value to the marketplace. As information
    is uploaded and stored on various different blockchain platforms, obtaining approval
    and consensus based verification linked to the accuracy of that data, the need
    for auditing in a traditional sense will change. Put simply, the need for auditors
    to perform tasks and engage with organizations as they currently do will either

- en: For example, traditional lending almost always takes place via a centralized
    model, and with the exception of an occasional gofundme campaign or other crowdfunding
    initiative or project, relies on a centralized source of capital to drive organizational
    growth. The idea of financing an organization or major business idea via a decentralized
    business model may seem radical or unorthodox to put it mildly, but will inevitably
    become more the business norm as blockchain becomes more widespread. The very
    idea of a blockchain business is to decentralize the access to information and
    data stored on the blockchain itself; whether that information happens to be financial
    information or other types of records. Decentralizing access to this information
    and data is a core principle of blockchain technology; raiding capital and securing
    the path forward for an organization is a traditional financial role that will
    inevitably result (Douaihy [2018](#CR4)). Financial professionals, whether taking
    the form of market makers themselves, or advising client organizations seeking
    to raise capital, do spend a relatively large amount of time and resources in
    this area. More pointedly, this also represents an area of the marketplace where
    financial professionals are well compensated; both the time and the compensation
    will invariably change and shift as decentralized capital raising becomes more
    normal. That said, and even with the somewhat radical nature of blockchain technology,
    it is important to realize that blockchain itself is not an innovative or new
    technology platform.

  zh: 例如，传统的借贷几乎总是通过集中式模式进行，除了偶尔的gofundme活动或其他众筹倡议或项目之外，都依赖于集中式的资本来源来推动组织的增长。通过去中心化的商业模式来为一个组织或重大商业理念提供资金的想法可能会被认为是激进或非正统，至少可以这样说，但随着区块链的普及，这将不可避免地成为更为常见的商业规范。区块链业务的核心理念是去中心化访问存储在区块链本身上的信息和数据；无论该信息是财务信息还是其他类型的记录。去中心化访问此信息和数据是区块链技术的核心原则；筹集资本和为组织的发展安全前进是传统金融角色，不可避免地将会发生变化（Douaihy
    [2018](#CR4)）。金融专业人士，无论是自己担任市场制造商，还是向寻求筹集资本的客户组织提供建议，都花费相当多的时间和资源在这个领域。更直截了当地说，这也代表了金融专业人士获得良好补偿的市场领域；随着去中心化筹资变得更为普遍，时间和补偿必然会发生变化和转移。尽管如此，并且即使区块链技术有些激进，重要的是要意识到区块链本身并不是创新或新技术平台。
- en: One additional point to emphasize and figure at this point is to also connect
    the idea of a blockchain network to that of a cloud based computing network. Put
    simply, since the idea of a blockchain is to allow real time access to data by
    a variety of members on a continuous basis, a hardwired and centralized setup
    will simply not be appropriate. If blockchain, as it often is, represents an evolution
    of the Internet, or the development of an Internet of value, thae what the new
    internet requires is a cloud based platform. Downloading and joining the Bitcoin
    blockchain, the largest such network to date, can be done by simply downloading
    the operating program from publicly available sources. Such ease and scalability

    are told exactly where to focus their efforts and activities. Drilling down and
    expanding this concept to the blockchain conversation, the implementation of blockchain
    technology appears to address this issue with the current trend toward increased
    centralization and analysis of data. Put simply, instead of relying on a specific
    organization – no matter how technologically oriented they may be – to secure
    and protect sensitive information – there is no need to rely on a single platform
    or technology to safeguard information. Again, since encryption and cryptography

- en: The key takeaway here is that, instead of having to safeguard, increase controls,
    and continuously increase the financial spend toward safeguarding information,
    the very nature of blockchain technology increases the security and safety around
    valuable information and data. This is not merely an academic concern nor a theoretical
    conversation; some of the largest, most sophisticated, and most well funded financial
    institutions in the world have been the victims of hacking and data losses. Equipping
    every single copy of the record with an increased security protocol in the form
    of encryption, and providing every single member of the blockchain network with
    a copy of this encrypted record is a paradigm shift. Instead of having to hack

    was via what is arguably it most well known application; cryptocurrencies. Whether
    it is bitcoin (the first and largest cryptocurrency), or one of the thousands
    of other cryptocurrencies that have entered the marketplace since 2016, it is
    certainly something that every financial services professional needs to be aware
    of and know about. These issues and developments occurring in the broader cryptocurrency
    space continue to evolve and change at an accelerating pace, including the rise
    of stablescoins, decentralized finance, and how blockchain technology intersects
    with the cryptocurrency space. Even as these technological developments accelerate
    and continue to weave into, there remain multiple areas and open items that have
    yet to be addressed for both accounting and financial reporting services. Recording
    these assets, developing services and business lines related to said assets forms
    the basis of this chapter, as well as how emerging themes and directions will
    continue to drive change in the financial services space. Topics that are introduced
    here, but are also revisited throughout the book include stablecoins, regulatory
    updates, the potential for new types of financial institutions to handle crypto
    related activities, and the implications this may have on accounting and finance
    at large. In other words, if a practitioner or a client are looking for an overview
    and introduction to the cryptocurrency landscape this chapter is a great place
    to get the information you need.
