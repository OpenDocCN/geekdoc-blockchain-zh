    network effects apply to solving blockchain problems as well. Problems are more
    likely to be solved as more parties work together to solve problems. The Kitty
    Core team quickly grew into a “Kitty Crisis” team; this kind of decentralized
    development is common to successful blockchain projects.

    to settle, and transaction fees can be unpredictable—user education was important
