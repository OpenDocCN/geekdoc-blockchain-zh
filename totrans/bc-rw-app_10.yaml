    happen only when the channel is closed. Once the channel is closed, only information
    about the initial contribution and the final balance on the blockchain is transmitted.

    which is used by cryptocurrencies. It is different from existing financial networks
    by being open and programmable. Anyone with an internet connection can use it
    without the approval of any authority. It operates via peer-to-peer financial
    networks, which use security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements.
    It works automatically without a central authority through smart contracts and
    the conditions underlying them, allowing developers to build secure decentralized
    financial applications. It enables developers to conceptualize new models for
    payment, investment, lending, trade, exchange, etc. without the control of banks
    and institutions. DeFi companies such as Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, and Uniswap
    are already developing such products that permit peer-to-peer finance, computing
    interest on cryptocurrency holdings, and trading through decentralized exchanges,
    etc.

    The current financial ecosystem falls under the category of a centralized finance,
    which includes centralized banks such as the Reserve Bank of India that fixes
    inputs around the repo rate. DeFi does not involve any such regulatory body or
    central bank and completely eliminates the control of banks and institutions over
    money, financial products, and financial services.

- en: In centralized finance, your money is held with banks, financial institutions,
    or corporations, which act as guarantors of transactions. This gives them immense
    freedom to make money. The financial system is full of third parties that facilitate
    the movement of funds between parties, and each entity charges a fee for its services.
    In DeFi, a smart contract takes the place of a financial institution in the transaction.
    A smart contract here is an Ethereum account that can hold, send, or return money,
    subject to a predetermined set of conditions. Smart contracts are always programmed
    for automation and cannot be changed once they go live. Consequently, it becomes
    easier for sellers, buyers, lenders, and borrowers to conduct peer-to-peer transactions
    rather than the company or institution facilitating it. As such, a farmer sells
    their produce directly to the end user without any middlemen. They get fresh access
    to a new buying community, and they will earn more dividend.

    loans. These loans are easier and more economical than loans taken from traditional
    banks. Users can keep their money in a secure digital wallet instead of in a bank
    and transfer funds as and when required.

    A P2P DeFi transaction is one in which two parties agree to exchange cryptocurrency
    for goods or services, without involving the third party. In a centralized bank
    system, when a customer visits the bank to apply for a loan, the bank checks his
    credit history, completes the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, and then calculates
    the value of the collateral, if any.

    to enter his loan requirements, and an algorithm matches his conditions with that

    to agree upon the terms of any one of those lenders to get the loan.

    is used to create a marketplace where users using the smart contract system lend,
    borrow, or exchange their cryptotokens by paying a fee. A part of this fee is
    given to the LP as a reward (proportionate to the amount of reward). The rewards,
    thus earned, can also be reinvested in other smart contracts. The rewards that

    model of public goods financing where a fund is provided by the government or
    philanthropic institutions that matches the individual contributions to a project.
    Quadratic funding strongly encourages people to contribute and ensures democratic
    allocation of funds. Matching amounts are calculated by using the quadratic funding
    formula, where the amount received by the project is proportional to the square
    of the sum of the square roots of contributions received.

- en: Prediction markets are exchange-traded markets where the outcome of events is
    traded. Market prices can indicate what the crowd thinks or what is likely to
    be the outcome of the event. It is a speculative market where participants do
    not bet on a product, option, or cryptocurrency, but rather, on information. Precisely,
    it’s a platform for buying and selling futures contracts on binary events. The
    market is structured such that individual contracts are priced between $0 and
    $1\. A participant buys a 50-cent contract for an outcome *x*, or its complement,
    *y*, and receives $1 if it results in *x*, or $0 if it does not. If we specify
    the contract price *x* as *px*, the price for *y* would theoretically be $1-*px*.
    Although, in practice, owing to market dynamics, contract prices may be a little
    lower or higher in order to generate revenue for the exchange or a fee to purchase
    the contract, or a pay-out to maintain equilibrium.

    are two possibilities here – it will survive or it will not survive. If you are
    confident that Ukraine will not survive, you can buy a number of “no” contracts.
    These can cost anywhere between $0 and $1\. If Ukraine does not survive, the “no”
    contracts will be redeemable for $1, and the “yes” contracts would have no value.
    Contrariwise, if it survives, a “no” contract would be worth nothing, while a
    “yes” contract would be worth $1.

    contract will fluctuate accordingly. If Russia continues to dominate Ukraine,
    then the “no” contract prices will escalate, and if Russia initiates a reconciliation,
    it can be assumed that Russia is becoming weak and the “yes” market will start
    picking up. Unlike the speculative market, contracts in the prediction market
    exist as securities rather than as isolated bets. This allows for significantly
    higher liquidity, given that participants do not need to wait until the event
    occurs. This liquidity, in turn, helps in price search because participants with
    relevant insights can take leverage of temporary mis-pricing rather than remain
    locked in their bets. Though it works like a standard speculative market, prediction
    markets are more advanced than an average speculative platform. It can prove to
    be a powerful forecasting tool when used correctly.

- en: James Surowiecki (2005), in his book, had expressed that a large sample of estimates
    of certain variables will likely be closer to the true value than most individual
    estimates. Prediction markets follow the same principle that the wisdom of the
    crowds will always be superior to the data known to a few experts. If individual
    estimates are based on esoteric knowledge and insight, a large-enough sample will
    be able to produce a desirable effect. However, participants’ estimates are independent,
    reflecting different perspectives, and this is why crowds can sometimes be extraordinarily
    foolish, such as when the stock market suddenly jumps or falls. Nevertheless,
    the prediction market can work only if such a mandatory disqualification factor
    is present. If everyone believes in the same thing, no one will take the other
    side of the contract. The antithesis to the potential for profit is certainly
    the potential for loss, which is equally valuable. The potential for profit entices
    people with unusual knowledge to join the market, but it is not possible for all
    members of a group to have perfect intuition, so the community pushes the market
    toward a price that is closer to reality.

    Whether due to local regulations or the reluctance of owners to list certain contracts,

    model can be replaced by decentralized alternatives with a blockchain-based approach.
    This can provide a number of benefits such as censorship resistance, elimination

    In fact, prediction markets are generally run by one party. This means that government
    authorities or terrible entities can easily shut them down. One advantage of adding
    cryptocurrency to prediction markets is that users can create arcades on the blockchain.
    Decentralized platforms are out of the grip of the government, so they cannot
    be taken down so easily. When the system is governed by smart contracts, no user
    can edit or delete the programs that underpin the market. The system executes
    the contracts by default, without the need for an intermediary (Garg, 2021b, 2022b).
    In prediction markets, smart contracts pool the money put in by speculators, and
    then automatically distributes it among the winners at the end of each market.
    The flip side, however, is that smart contracts are a relatively new technology
    and have been observed to result in loss of money in the past due to bugs or flawed

    stake if their predictions go wrong. It’s the only platform in the market that
    provides such features. It strives to change the way asset classes and events
    are predicted, owns losses for inaccuracies, provides more incentive for users
    to stake and make predictions, and encourages users to say what they believe events
    will result.

    of the event around which it is centered, those collaborators get the rewards.
    It promotes a true synergistic approach to prediction.
