    the banking industry can effectively adopt this technology. Perhaps, the very
    purpose of setting up the banking industry has a lot in common with the nature
    of blockchain. Banking institutions came into existence to make all kinds of trade

    mechanisms, such as smart contracts within a single platform, banks can reduce
    the interference of counterparties and middlemen. This can significantly reduce
    transaction fees by eliminating the overhead costs payable on creating, executing,
    and exchanging assets manually. The elimination of the middleman has also made
    processes, such as cross-border payments, trade, and settlements faster, more
    reliable, and less expensive. Moreover, blockchain does not require expensive
    proprietary infrastructure that further curtails the maintenance expenditure.

    double-entry bookkeeping. Instead of keeping separate records based on transaction
    receipts, businesses can directly combine transactions into a combined ledger.
    All entries in the ledger will be distributed. As a result, records will be more
    transparent and secure. A blockchain will act like a digital notary who verifies
    all transactions. Blockchain smart contracts can be used to pay invoices automatically
    in such applications.

    for a period of time, the whole system comes to a standstill. In 2014, the Real
    Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) of the United Kingdom experienced a downtime
    of nine hours (Deloitte, 2014). Though all the banks and other institutions were
    operational, the high-value transactions could not happen during this period.
    The advantage of using a distributed ledger is that the blockchain is partition

    of the nodes continue to function since all nodes carry a copy of the same data.

    transporters, agents, exporters, and importers – to share a common distributed
    ledger for trade practices. Business documents can be digitized to enable automatic
    implementation of trade processes through smart contracts. Since the flow of critical
    information between parties will be done through an event-driven mechanism, much
    of the trade friction and painful handover of goods can be turned into real-time
    response of workflow status. This will eliminate the repetitive manual checks
    used to verify business logistics, freight delivery, and payment references (see

    or corporations, which act as guarantors of transactions. This gives them immense
    freedom to make money. The financial system is full of third parties that facilitate
    the movement of funds between parties, and each entity charges a fee for its services.
    In DeFi, a smart contract takes the place of a financial institution in the transaction.
    A smart contract here is an Ethereum account that can hold, send, or return money,
    subject to a predetermined set of conditions. Smart contracts are always programmed
    for automation and cannot be changed once they go live. Consequently, it becomes
    easier for sellers, buyers, lenders, and borrowers to conduct peer-to-peer transactions
    rather than the company or institution facilitating it. As such, a farmer sells

    in the operating mechanism.
  prefs: []

    (LPs). The Ethereum blockchain is the most popular underlying technology for these
    types of applications. Literally, LPs are users who provide money or liquidity
    to a smart contract, primarily in exchange for a reward in the system. This pool
    is used to create a marketplace where users using the smart contract system lend,
    borrow, or exchange their cryptotokens by paying a fee. A part of this fee is
    given to the LP as a reward (proportionate to the amount of reward). The rewards,
    thus earned, can also be reinvested in other smart contracts. The rewards that
    LPs receive are also a type of ERC-20 token.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prediction markets are exchange-traded markets where the outcome of events is
    traded. Market prices can indicate what the crowd thinks or what is likely to
    be the outcome of the event. It is a speculative market where participants do
    not bet on a product, option, or cryptocurrency, but rather, on information. Precisely,
    it’s a platform for buying and selling futures contracts on binary events. The
    market is structured such that individual contracts are priced between $0 and
    $1\. A participant buys a 50-cent contract for an outcome *x*, or its complement,
    *y*, and receives $1 if it results in *x*, or $0 if it does not. If we specify
    the contract price *x* as *px*, the price for *y* would theoretically be $1-*px*.
    Although, in practice, owing to market dynamics, contract prices may be a little
    lower or higher in order to generate revenue for the exchange or a fee to purchase
    the contract, or a pay-out to maintain equilibrium.

    are two possibilities here – it will survive or it will not survive. If you are
    confident that Ukraine will not survive, you can buy a number of “no” contracts.
    These can cost anywhere between $0 and $1\. If Ukraine does not survive, the “no”
    contracts will be redeemable for $1, and the “yes” contracts would have no value.
    Contrariwise, if it survives, a “no” contract would be worth nothing, while a
    “yes” contract would be worth $1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meanwhile, there will be changes in the market sentiment, and the value of the
    contract will fluctuate accordingly. If Russia continues to dominate Ukraine,
    then the “no” contract prices will escalate, and if Russia initiates a reconciliation,
    it can be assumed that Russia is becoming weak and the “yes” market will start
    picking up. Unlike the speculative market, contracts in the prediction market
    exist as securities rather than as isolated bets. This allows for significantly
    higher liquidity, given that participants do not need to wait until the event
    occurs. This liquidity, in turn, helps in price search because participants with
    relevant insights can take leverage of temporary mis-pricing rather than remain
    locked in their bets. Though it works like a standard speculative market, prediction
    markets are more advanced than an average speculative platform. It can prove to
    be a powerful forecasting tool when used correctly.

- en: James Surowiecki (2005), in his book, had expressed that a large sample of estimates
    of certain variables will likely be closer to the true value than most individual
    estimates. Prediction markets follow the same principle that the wisdom of the
    crowds will always be superior to the data known to a few experts. If individual
    estimates are based on esoteric knowledge and insight, a large-enough sample will
    be able to produce a desirable effect. However, participants’ estimates are independent,
    reflecting different perspectives, and this is why crowds can sometimes be extraordinarily
    foolish, such as when the stock market suddenly jumps or falls. Nevertheless,
    the prediction market can work only if such a mandatory disqualification factor
    is present. If everyone believes in the same thing, no one will take the other
    side of the contract. The antithesis to the potential for profit is certainly
    the potential for loss, which is equally valuable. The potential for profit entices
    people with unusual knowledge to join the market, but it is not possible for all
    members of a group to have perfect intuition, so the community pushes the market
    toward a price that is closer to reality.

    Whether due to local regulations or the reluctance of owners to list certain contracts,
    whatever centralized platforms offer today is inadequate. Users need a platform
    that is quick and doesn’t levy charges for third parties. The traditional centralized
    model can be replaced by decentralized alternatives with a blockchain-based approach.
    This can provide a number of benefits such as censorship resistance, elimination
    of middlemen, and increased access.

    Right now the markets in the US are highly regulated, and participating in them

    on a central entity. With Ethereum, the idea is that the rules contained in its
    code can guide certain actions in the project.

    In fact, prediction markets are generally run by one party. This means that government
    authorities or terrible entities can easily shut them down. One advantage of adding
    cryptocurrency to prediction markets is that users can create arcades on the blockchain.
    Decentralized platforms are out of the grip of the government, so they cannot
    be taken down so easily. When the system is governed by smart contracts, no user
    can edit or delete the programs that underpin the market. The system executes
    the contracts by default, without the need for an intermediary (Garg, 2021b, 2022b).
    In prediction markets, smart contracts pool the money put in by speculators, and
    then automatically distributes it among the winners at the end of each market.
    The flip side, however, is that smart contracts are a relatively new technology
    and have been observed to result in loss of money in the past due to bugs or flawed
    code.
