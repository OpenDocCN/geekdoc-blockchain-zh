    the model for transactions and lead us to enter an entirely new world of businesses.
    Bitcoins can be thought of as a digital currency through a digital wallet which
    does not requires any trusted third party such as a bank or any other centralized
    authority for making transactions. In fact this digital transaction model uses
    a blockchain technology and is based on the concept of ‘proof of work’ where users
    execute their transactions by signing their transactions using digital signatures.
    As there is no concept for trusted third party hence implementations also provide
    a solution for double spending problems. This chapter presents the detailed discussions
    about the bitcoin as a cryptocurrency which uses blockchain as its medium of transactions.
    The transaction using bitcoins before entering into a blockchain must be validated
    by miners using blockchain mining. The miners, for validating a transaction, are
    awarded incentives that make the business of bitcoins based on blockchain alive.
    A Bitcoin Initial Coin Offering (ICO) can be broadly explained in terms of mechanism
    of crowd raising funds for entrepreneurial firms for their innovative and promising
    ideas where they are able to sell their tokens to investors in exchange funds
    for capital just like shares in Initial Public Offering (IPO). Studies have shown
    that bitcoins have been largely accepted by merchants for their businesses.

    which, with the help of cryptographic functions is able to perform financial transactions
    without the intervention of a trusted third party such as a bank or some other
    financial institution. Instead of creating a Trust-based model it uses a peer-to-peer
    network terminology creating a blockchain. This method of performing financial
    transactions is a transparent method which decentralizes the control of any governing
    body or trusted third party.

    buyer. On the other hand, unlike the currency that we use today, a Bitcoin is
    created using an address. It is traded using blockchain technology that maintains
    a distributed and decentralized open ledger for all its users making an entry
    for all financial transactions. These transactions are cryptographically encrypted

    This hash value is appended at the end of bitcoin under transaction. This complete

    of transactions to be validated. This *nonce* when combined with the data provided
    in the block and passed through a hash function, such as SHA256, must provide
    a result that matches the given condition, for example the corresponding hash
    must begin with a specified number of zero bits. If a matching result is found

- en: Start-ups and budding Entrepreneurs usually face many hurdles in terms of insuﬃcient
    funds or capital despite having a brilliant innovative idea to sell. A certain
    capital amount is required for growth and sustenance by a firm. Nobody will easily
    finance these new firms because of lack of trust as compared to already established
    businesses. Besides trust issues, distorted and insuﬃcient information, accountability
    issues, agency conflicts, and exorbitant transaction costs for funding agencies
    or financial backers such as banks, stock exchange, venture capitalist or public
    are a few major reasons for a lack of financing for these new firms [7].

    Coin Offering (ICO) came into existence. ICOs are primarily used by start-ups
    for raising funds in order to offer the products and services. ICO is based on
    the Blockchain technology, which was introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto in
    his white paper about “*Bitcoin*”.

    in terms of mechanism of crowd raising funds for entrepreneurial firms for their
    innovative and promising ideas where they are able to sell their tokens to investors
    in exchange for funds for capital just like shares in Initial Public Offering
    (IPO) [2]. ICOs are more or less similar to the stocks but they are utilized for
    services or products offered. But while using ICO for business one has to be careful
    as they can output huge returns for investors or they can be fraud or total failure
    to the businesses.

    etc. which is built on blockchain technology. A Bitcoin is a money equivalent;
    it has some value associated with it. You can buy a token with a coin but not
    a coin with a token. The value of cryptocurrency Bitcoin depends upon blockchain
    miners but the value of a token is independent of mining. If it is a Laptop manufacturing
    start-up, one token can be equal to one laptop or in an IT start-up firm, a token
    can be an annual license offer of software. Any service can be tokenized [8].

    token sale works, what is the timeline for that, general terms and token purchase
    agreement, etc. Once you go through the agreement, you must download the wallet
    as per recommendations by the ICO team. These agreements contains systematic guide
    for the token sale participation. Before the token transaction some operation
    fee called gas amount is decided. When the token sales start, there can be three
    possible scenarios. Firstly, you may receive the token right away, or you may
    need to wait for some time for collection of the token or lastly you may redeem
    your token manually. ICOs are unregulated and hence while using them one must
    be extra cautious and diligent in order to research, trade or invest in ICOs.'

    an open issue. Although cryptocurrency is the future considering today’s scenario
    accepting Bitcoin as a payment medium poses a big problem. Any merchant doing
    business must have a profit margin, say 5% or 10% or 30%. If someone is paying
    in bitcoins, the value of bitcoins may go up to say 5% or 10% or so and may also
    possibly go down to say 5% or 10% or so within a day. Hence, if one’s business
    is cash rich and doesn’t require money to continue this business, bitcoin transactions
    must be chosen as in long run say after a period of 5–10 years its value probably
    might increase and returns profit. Otherwise bitcoin payment may not be a good
    option. Despite all these facts, bitcoins are being accepted at various levels.

    has raised it in status over so many years, but by virtue of its design only a
    fixed number of bitcoins can exist. Bitcoins are being mined with never ending
    returns thereby generating new bitcoins until the maximum limit is reached. A
    maximum of twenty one million bitcoins [10] can be created. As the value of bitcoins
    is limited, no inflation will be there due to excess availability of bit-coins.
    Also these cryptocurrencies will be protected from inflation due to any changes
    in government or any restrictions [11]. Hence, they are safe for investors who
    want to invest their wealth into bitcoins. Besides not responding to inflation,
    the price of bitcoins can fluctuate due to some of the external factors. All these
    factors helped bitcoin to be the best performing currency for the year 2015 [9]
    and are the highest value currency in the entire world.
