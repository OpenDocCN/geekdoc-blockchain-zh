    applications governing pipeline operations at the Colonial Pipeline Company. They
    encrypted data and locked access to the system critical to the pipeline’s functioning
    and demanded ransom payments to release the data.[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en1) Colonial’s
    5,500-mile gasoline and diesel fuel infrastructure links refineries on the Texas
    Gulf Coast with most of the eastern seaboard, supplying 45 percent of the fuel
    consumed by individuals and enterprises in major metropolitan areas and states
    such as New York, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia. Such ransomware
    attacks are commonplace—and costly—for enterprises of all kinds. The attack forced
    Colonial to temporarily halt its pipeline operations, leading to regional gas
    shortages, long lines, price increases, and gas hoarding. It also revealed (again)
    the vulnerability of critical US infrastructure operations to cyberattacks. Colonial
    paid a ransom of around $5 million to be able to decrypt its data and regain access
    to computer systems.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en2) And in addition to paying the ransom,
    the company had to contend with lost revenue and reputational damage.

    to protect itself and its operations and databases against adversarial, ill-intentioned
    economic actors. A solution lies in distributed ledger technology (DLT), popularly
    referred to as blockchain. DLT was designed with the assumption that firms will
    be faced with untrustworthy counterparties who will attempt to exploit online
    transactions for private gain. In the case of Colonial, with its use of sensors,
    valves, and leak detection systems in controlling its pipelines, blockchain-based
    multitier cybersecurity protection in a smart metering environment could have
    provided protection.[3](14085-0014.xhtml#en3) An alternative would be using distributed
    data storage for critical data, linked to a permissioned blockchain.[4](14085-0014.xhtml#en4)

    exist, such as air-gapped systems,[5](14085-0014.xhtml#en5) offline cold backups,
    and a tested IT disaster recovery plan. In air-gapped systems (where the network
    is disconnected from outside networks, both wired and wireless, with WiFi transceivers
    prevented from being in the vicinity of the air-gapped systems), the only way
    to transfer data is to copy the information to a physical peripheral such as a
    tape backup or a hard drive and then connect it to a recipient system. Offline
    cold backups, done with all users offline, ensure that files cannot be changed
    during backup and are protected from live viruses and hacking attempts, with the
    backup data stored offline. Blockchain offers an alternative but must prove its
    superior effectiveness over legacy solutions to justify making the transition.
    While blockchain has existed for more than a decade, only in recent years has
    it matured to the point of becoming a potentially disruptive innovation. This
    book explores the opportunities blockchain makes possible, while also defining
    the limits of current blockchain applications, to provide leaders of legacy enterprises
    with strategies to leverage blockchain for maximum competitive advantage.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DLT relies on three interconnected concepts—distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networks,
    robust cryptography, and game theory–derived incentives known as tokens. Tokens
    are digital assets that have value and can be used as rewards to motivate desired
    behavior and as a means of payment within the DLT for services rendered by a participant,
    such as verifying authenticity or transferring asset ownership. Blockchain is
    one application of DLT and is perhaps the best known, and it specifically groups
    exchange transactions between counterparties into blocks and then cryptographically
    chains the blocks together, hence “blockchain.” Blockchain is the technology underlying
    Bitcoin creation and exchange, and since then its applicability has rapidly reached
    far beyond cryptocurrency. DLT uses robust encryption so that data is secure and
    available only to intended recipients. Copies of the data are distributed across
    nodes so that hacking data would require breaking into the multiple nodes and
    altering each copy, making tampering increasingly evident as well as increasingly
    difficult.

    stored in data silos at multiple locations, administrative costs can run up to
    20 percent of shipment value. Delays due to lost or damaged documents, or data

    That is a problem because cross-border payments are expected to total around $30
    trillion in 2022, incurring fees as high as 6–7 percent of the transfer amount,
    which could total over $2 trillion. Payments can take several days, and when a
    sending agent does not have a presence in the receiving country, they must rely
    on a local financial institution to complete the transfer. Those transfers can
    be opaque to clients who may not know in advance when the transaction will be
    completed and the specific exchange rate used for conversion, leaving them facing

    well as their industries—have struggled to protect the digital files of their
    work from being copied and/or stolen. Creators and companies primarily reach consumers
    through intermediaries whose fees can be a significant portion of the total transaction
    revenue. Music streaming services provided by Spotify, Apple, Amazon, Google,
    and the like pay musicians relatively small amounts for their art, with the bulk
    of profits from membership fees and purchases of music files going to global music
    recording companies and producers. If musicians made their music available on
    a blockchain, listeners could connect to that blockchain using an app. They could
    then pay with microtransactions in return for varying levels of access, for example,
    one-time listening, repeated listens over a certain duration, and sampling rights.
    This would help musicians cut out the streaming services as an intermediary and
    keep more revenue for themselves, disrupting Spotify, Apple, and others, just
    as those streamers once disrupted older music distribution businesses. Berklee
    College of Music launched its Open Music Initiative with this goal in mind, making

    reports without identifying themselves, ensuring their personal data is not linked
    to the encrypted genomic information stored off-chain. Companies offering genome
    sequencing can profit by sharing their customers’ data with third parties, and
    Nebula’s point of differentiation is that it allows its customers to decide whether
    to give permissioned access to their data to outside entities such as pharmaceutical
    companies or academic medical researchers. This allows customers to earn fees
    for their data while also contributing to medical research and without compromising
    their privacy. Nebula can protect privacy and guard against data misuse by restricting
    researcher data analysis to trusted execution environments (TEEs), wherein researchers
    can analyze data on Nebula’s computing equipment and storage devices, which anonymize
    individual data.[21](14085-0014.xhtml#en21)

    additional functionality and expand their ecosystems to create and deliver robust
    solutions. Promoting the development of ecosystems around the initial innovation
    allows blockchain-based customer solutions to be developed collaboratively across
    firms and industries, disrupting intermediary profit streams further still. Thus,
    in Filecoin’s case, third party apps such as Codefi’s Filecoin Storage app, provide
    additional capabilities, which allows potential users to search the Filecoin storage
    marketplace and compare prices, storage capacity and their reputation score.

    numbers, leading to significant shifts in market share, disruption is complete.
    However, we are not yet at the stage where any blockchain disruptor is showing
    a sign of breaking into the mainstream. Initially, blockchain primarily appeals
    to technologically savvy users comfortable conducting mobile e-commerce transactions
    on smartphones and using distributed apps (Dapps). Dapps are specific to blockchain
    in that they run on P2P networks with transactions recorded on nodes across the
    distributed network. This contrasts with traditional apps that run in a client
    server mode, with the app transacting with a centralized server, possibly in the
    cloud. In the case of an app, information is centralized at the server and can
    be hacked. Dapps are designed to take advantage of the tamper-evident and tamperproof
    nature of transaction validation and recording across distributed nodes in the
    P2P blockchain network.

    customers. Changing standard blockchain architecture to entice mainstream market
    customers may come at the price of some of blockchain’s innovative edge. In the
    case of financial applications, for example, incumbent enterprises would want
    to improve transaction processing speed while limiting the reproduction of transaction
    details at every node. “Permissioned blockchains,” which use permissioned nodes
    that grant read-and-write privileges to fewer nodes, may meet both needs. Restricting
    write privileges increases transaction processing speed, while limiting read access
    helps keep transaction details private and known only to the permissioned nodes,
    favoring their enterprise use.

    nodes, reducing visibility of transactions at every node. However, controlling
    the right to join the blockchain and specifically grant read-and-write privileges
    preserves the centrality of incumbent intermediaries, who would be able to exercise
    control and governance authority. In other words, intermediaries would be able
    to control access to the blockchain, set performance standards, and continue to
    charge intermediary fees, albeit at a lower level. This, of course, undoes one
    of blockchain’s signature innovations—disintermediation—raising costs and increasing
    network vulnerability if the central incumbent nodes are hacked and compromised.

    by incumbents. Blockchain, as discussed in the next chapter, needs to overcome
    various obstacles that currently make it less capable of satisfying the needs
    of large enterprises. As challengers upgrade their applications, incumbents will
    have the time and opportunity to learn from start-up missteps, which will allow
    them to study the underperformance of their challengers and to develop business
    use cases that can benefit from blockchain applications. Incumbents may then have
    a better understanding of their customers’ needs and frustrations. They can draw
    on longer-duration customer relationships and accumulated customer interaction
    data.

    and use such information to address product and service limitations. This backdrop
    allows them to combine customer data with advances in blockchain methodology to
    launch pilot projects and test how a blockchain application can improve customer
    outcomes. Of course, they might conclude that moving to blockchain is unnecessary
    and that challengers could be fought off with improvements to legacy applications
    that overcome their deficiencies. But for incumbents who find use in blockchain,
    their depth of knowledge and experience in their own arenas will empower them
    to head off possible inroads by challengers while taking the lead in enterprise
    blockchain implementation.

    disruptive capabilities. I show how these features can be leveraged to resolve
    long-standing problems affecting enterprises and their customers. I then highlight
    blockchain benefits for enterprises, discussing internal applications and customer-facing
    and ecosystem-wide applications, illustrating these application directions with
    examples. Internal applications are easier to develop and use, likely resulting
    in accurate, widely available data and transaction records (a single source of
    truth) and efficiency gains. Such lower hanging fruit can lay the groundwork for
    more complex external applications, which are likely to provide better customer
    solutions and a possible competitive advantage.

    how they are being resolved. I examine blockchain start-ups and how they are resolving
    technological barriers to blockchain application, particularly the blockchain
    trilemma: simultaneously maximizing the security, scalability, and speed, influenced
    by the extent of decentralization. Disruptive technologies are often brought to
    market and continuously improved by new entrants. This continuous improvement
    process helps harden and improve the technology, overcome performance gaps, and
    improve competitiveness with legacy systems. I review several such blockchain
    start-ups and their business models and the customer needs they are attempting
    to satisfy. Only 10 percent of blockchain trials have made it into production,
    and blockchain projects are “progressing faster” in other markets outside the
    US, especially in Asia-Pacific.[22](14085-0014.xhtml#en22) Technological advances
    from these start-ups are essential to the realization of blockchain’s disruptive
    potential and eventual blockchain acceptance in enterprises. The various examples
    highlighted in this chapter point to a wide range of innovative activity in the
    blockchain arena. Their experience offers pointers for formulating blockchain
    strategy, and I draw lessons from their choices regarding problems addressed,
    vertical market focus, industry-specific solutions, and complementing key applications

    possibility of disrupting the financial services market. A set of emerging alternatives,
    collectively described as decentralized finance, is discussed in chapter 4\. Financial
    services cover a range of offerings, such as payments, savings, credit and lending,
    remittances, trading and settlement, exchanges and derivatives markets, and insurance.
    These many facets of financial services are marked by the need for intermediaries
    to manage counterparty risk, obtain legal compliance with regulations, and provide
    access to the services. Intermediaries in the financial world maintain control
    over assets (on behalf of customers), assume systemic risk, and have access to
    aspects of transaction data. Incumbents offer trusted service across multiple
    integrated services in return for intermediary fees, which can be a significant
    portion of transaction amounts or assets. The several decentralized finance applications
    discussed in this chapter represent a surge of innovation, with each major category
    of decentralized finance innovation building on previous advances in earlier decentralized
    finance apps, gradually creating a complete decentralized finance ecosystem that
    has the potential to make decentralized finance the “killer app” in blockchain.

    is the global supply chain and trade finance complex, which is discussed in chapter
    5\. Global supply chains function ponderously because of their reliance on paper-based
    processes and electronic data interchange (EDI) for transmitting documents. Conflicting
    information and lost documents lead to errors and slow down transaction approval,
    resulting in long lead times, lack of transparency concerning status and location
    of a specific shipment, and inefficient capital allocation. Chapter 5 discusses
    several supply chain blockchain pilots gaining traction. The discussion in this
    chapter spans the interconnection of supply chains, cross-border payments, trade
    financing, and marketplaces matching buyers and sellers. I discuss blockchain
    benefits for supply chain performance, from data consolidation and visibility
    to shipment tracking, enhancing transparency and trust in supply chain network
    data, monitoring shipments, and solving problems in real time.

    arise in thinking about blockchains as ecosystems, including cultivating ecosystem
    membership, coordinating cocreation, fair sharing of rewards among members, ecosystem
    governance, and evolution. I then discuss how blockchains can be used in an ecosystems

    such as distributed databases and a control tower/dashboard might work, and the
    discussion in this final chapter highlights when blockchain deployment is the
    best approach. Blockchain applications, at their heart, involve democratizing
    access and offering autonomy and control over decision making, risk taking, and
    sharing rewards. Together, these traits represent a departure for an enterprise
    accustomed to exercising centralized control in hierarchically structured organizations
    and solutions. The analysis and discussion in this final chapter, along with the
    strategy road map, can help enterprises prepare for the rise of a disruptive technology,
    one that will impose a radical shift in almost all ways of doing business.
