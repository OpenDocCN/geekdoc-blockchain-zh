- en: In 2021, a group of hackers broke into a computer system containing software
    applications governing pipeline operations at the Colonial Pipeline Company. They
    encrypted data and locked access to the system critical to the pipeline’s functioning
    and demanded ransom payments to release the data.[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en1) Colonial’s
    5,500-mile gasoline and diesel fuel infrastructure links refineries on the Texas
    Gulf Coast with most of the eastern seaboard, supplying 45 percent of the fuel
    consumed by individuals and enterprises in major metropolitan areas and states
    such as New York, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia. Such ransomware
    attacks are commonplace—and costly—for enterprises of all kinds. The attack forced
    Colonial to temporarily halt its pipeline operations, leading to regional gas
    shortages, long lines, price increases, and gas hoarding. It also revealed (again)
    the vulnerability of critical US infrastructure operations to cyberattacks. Colonial
    paid a ransom of around $5 million to be able to decrypt its data and regain access
    to computer systems.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en2) And in addition to paying the ransom,
    the company had to contend with lost revenue and reputational damage.

    Colonial 的 5,500 英里长的汽油和柴油燃料基础设施连接了德克萨斯州墨西哥湾沿岸的炼油厂和东海岸的大部分地区，为纽约、弗吉尼亚州、北卡罗来纳州、南卡罗来纳州和乔治亚州等主要大都市区和企业供应了
    45% 的燃料。这种勒索软件攻击对各类企业来说已是家常便饭——且代价高昂。这次袭击迫使 Colonial 暂时停止了管道运营，导致了地区性汽油短缺、长队、价格上涨和汽油囤积。它还再次揭示了美国关键基础设施运营对网络攻击的脆弱性。Colonial
    支付了约 500 万美元的赎金以解密其数据并重新访问计算机系统。[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en2) 除了支付赎金外，该公司还必须应对收入损失和声誉损害。

    to protect itself and its operations and databases against adversarial, ill-intentioned
    economic actors. A solution lies in distributed ledger technology (DLT), popularly
    referred to as blockchain. DLT was designed with the assumption that firms will
    be faced with untrustworthy counterparties who will attempt to exploit online
    transactions for private gain. In the case of Colonial, with its use of sensors,
    valves, and leak detection systems in controlling its pipelines, blockchain-based
    multitier cybersecurity protection in a smart metering environment could have
    provided protection.[3](14085-0014.xhtml#en3) An alternative would be using distributed

    exist, such as air-gapped systems,[5](14085-0014.xhtml#en5) offline cold backups,
    and a tested IT disaster recovery plan. In air-gapped systems (where the network
    is disconnected from outside networks, both wired and wireless, with WiFi transceivers
    prevented from being in the vicinity of the air-gapped systems), the only way
    to transfer data is to copy the information to a physical peripheral such as a
    tape backup or a hard drive and then connect it to a recipient system. Offline
    cold backups, done with all users offline, ensure that files cannot be changed
    during backup and are protected from live viruses and hacking attempts, with the
    backup data stored offline. Blockchain offers an alternative but must prove its
    superior effectiveness over legacy solutions to justify making the transition.
    While blockchain has existed for more than a decade, only in recent years has
    it matured to the point of becoming a potentially disruptive innovation. This
    book explores the opportunities blockchain makes possible, while also defining
    the limits of current blockchain applications, to provide leaders of legacy enterprises
    with strategies to leverage blockchain for maximum competitive advantage.

  zh: 什么是 DLT 和区块链？
- en: DLT relies on three interconnected concepts—distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) networks,
    robust cryptography, and game theory–derived incentives known as tokens. Tokens
    are digital assets that have value and can be used as rewards to motivate desired
    behavior and as a means of payment within the DLT for services rendered by a participant,
    such as verifying authenticity or transferring asset ownership. Blockchain is
    one application of DLT and is perhaps the best known, and it specifically groups
    exchange transactions between counterparties into blocks and then cryptographically
    chains the blocks together, hence “blockchain.” Blockchain is the technology underlying
    Bitcoin creation and exchange, and since then its applicability has rapidly reached
    far beyond cryptocurrency. DLT uses robust encryption so that data is secure and
    available only to intended recipients. Copies of the data are distributed across
    nodes so that hacking data would require breaking into the multiple nodes and
    altering each copy, making tampering increasingly evident as well as increasingly
    difficult.

  zh: DLT 依赖于三个相互关联的概念——分布式点对点（P2P）网络、强加密技术和源自博弈论的激励机制，即代币。代币是具有价值的数字资产，可以作为奖励来激励期望的行为，也可以作为参与者在
    DLT 中提供服务，如验证真实性或转移资产所有权的支付手段。区块链是 DLT 的一个应用，也是最为人所知的应用，它特别将交易双方之间的交易所分组到区块中，然后通过加密技术将区块链接起来，因此得名“区块链”。区块链是比特币创建和交易的技术基础，自那以后，其适用性迅速扩展到了加密货币之外更广泛的领域。DLT
    使用强加密，以确保数据安全并仅对预期接收者可用。数据的副本分布在节点上，因此篡改数据需要入侵多个节点并更改每个副本，这使得篡改行为越来越明显，也越来越困难。

    well as their industries—have struggled to protect the digital files of their
    work from being copied and/or stolen. Creators and companies primarily reach consumers
    through intermediaries whose fees can be a significant portion of the total transaction
    revenue. Music streaming services provided by Spotify, Apple, Amazon, Google,
    and the like pay musicians relatively small amounts for their art, with the bulk
    of profits from membership fees and purchases of music files going to global music
    recording companies and producers. If musicians made their music available on
    a blockchain, listeners could connect to that blockchain using an app. They could
    then pay with microtransactions in return for varying levels of access, for example,
    one-time listening, repeated listens over a certain duration, and sampling rights.
    This would help musicians cut out the streaming services as an intermediary and
    keep more revenue for themselves, disrupting Spotify, Apple, and others, just

    nodes also makes it almost impossible for hackers to intrude and alter or extract
    information. Compared to centralized databases, blockchain offers greater protection
    from hackers, allowing economic actors to trust transaction information generated
    and stored on it. The chaining of transactions into tamper-resistant blocks allows
    counterparties to trace a transaction back to its course and thus pinpoint when
    a problem or error occurred. And with blockchain’s decentralized secure network,
    a transaction can be completed simultaneously with the finalization of a payment.

    to overcome its performance gaps relative to mainstream legacy solutions, especially
    in areas such as processing speed, scalability, security, and user friendliness.
    It is generally opaque to the mass market; few mainstream users have experience
    using blockchain, and experience with private and public keys to protect security.

    the benefits blockchain has to offer. Enterprises must contend with attenuated
    organizational boundaries and develop cooperative strategies for innovation and
    customer service, a step they may not be ready for. Enterprises also have to prepare

    的中心地位，他们能够行使控制和治理权力。换句话说，中介机构将能够控制对区块链的访问，设定性能标准，并继续收取中介费用，尽管费用水平较低。这当然颠覆了区块链的一个标志性创新——去中介化——如果中心节点被黑客攻击和妥协，将增加成本并提高网络脆弱性。

    by incumbents. Blockchain, as discussed in the next chapter, needs to overcome
    various obstacles that currently make it less capable of satisfying the needs
    of large enterprises. As challengers upgrade their applications, incumbents will
    have the time and opportunity to learn from start-up missteps, which will allow
    them to study the underperformance of their challengers and to develop business
    use cases that can benefit from blockchain applications. Incumbents may then have
    a better understanding of their customers’ needs and frustrations. They can draw
    on longer-duration customer relationships and accumulated customer interaction
    data.

    outcomes. Of course, they might conclude that moving to blockchain is unnecessary
    and that challengers could be fought off with improvements to legacy applications
    that overcome their deficiencies. But for incumbents who find use in blockchain,
    their depth of knowledge and experience in their own arenas will empower them
    to head off possible inroads by challengers while taking the lead in enterprise
    blockchain implementation.

    long-standing problems affecting enterprises and their customers. I then highlight
    blockchain benefits for enterprises, discussing internal applications and customer-facing
    and ecosystem-wide applications, illustrating these application directions with
    examples. Internal applications are easier to develop and use, likely resulting
    in accurate, widely available data and transaction records (a single source of
    truth) and efficiency gains. Such lower hanging fruit can lay the groundwork for
    more complex external applications, which are likely to provide better customer
    solutions and a possible competitive advantage.

    how they are being resolved. I examine blockchain start-ups and how they are resolving
    technological barriers to blockchain application, particularly the blockchain
    trilemma: simultaneously maximizing the security, scalability, and speed, influenced
    by the extent of decentralization. Disruptive technologies are often brought to
    market and continuously improved by new entrants. This continuous improvement
    process helps harden and improve the technology, overcome performance gaps, and
    improve competitiveness with legacy systems. I review several such blockchain
    start-ups and their business models and the customer needs they are attempting
    to satisfy. Only 10 percent of blockchain trials have made it into production,
    and blockchain projects are “progressing faster” in other markets outside the
    US, especially in Asia-Pacific.[22](14085-0014.xhtml#en22) Technological advances
    from these start-ups are essential to the realization of blockchain’s disruptive
    potential and eventual blockchain acceptance in enterprises. The various examples
    highlighted in this chapter point to a wide range of innovative activity in the
    blockchain arena. Their experience offers pointers for formulating blockchain
    strategy, and I draw lessons from their choices regarding problems addressed,

- en: Blockchain deployment in tandem with the rise of digital currencies raises the
    possibility of disrupting the financial services market. A set of emerging alternatives,
    collectively described as decentralized finance, is discussed in chapter 4\. Financial
    services cover a range of offerings, such as payments, savings, credit and lending,
    remittances, trading and settlement, exchanges and derivatives markets, and insurance.
    These many facets of financial services are marked by the need for intermediaries
    to manage counterparty risk, obtain legal compliance with regulations, and provide
    access to the services. Intermediaries in the financial world maintain control
    over assets (on behalf of customers), assume systemic risk, and have access to
    aspects of transaction data. Incumbents offer trusted service across multiple
    integrated services in return for intermediary fees, which can be a significant
    portion of transaction amounts or assets. The several decentralized finance applications
    discussed in this chapter represent a surge of innovation, with each major category
    of decentralized finance innovation building on previous advances in earlier decentralized
    finance apps, gradually creating a complete decentralized finance ecosystem that
    has the potential to make decentralized finance the “killer app” in blockchain.

  zh: 随着数字货币的兴起，区块链部署的可能性提高了颠覆金融服务市场的潜力。在第4章中，讨论了一组新兴的替代方案，统称为去中心化金融。金融服务涵盖了一系列 offerings，如支付、储蓄、信贷和贷款、汇款、交易和结算、交易所和衍生品市场以及保险。这些金融服务领域的许多方面都需要中介机构来管理对手方风险、获得法律合规以及提供服务。金融世界的中介机构控制着资产（代表客户），承担系统风险，并接触到交易数据的某些方面。现有机构提供跨多个综合服务的可信服务，以中介费用作为回报，这可能是一个交易金额或资产的重要部分。本章讨论的去中心化金融应用代表了一场创新浪潮，每一大类去中心化金融创新都是建立在早期去中心化金融应用的先前进展之上，逐渐形成了一个完整的去中心化金融生态系统，该系统有潜力使去中心化金融成为区块链上的“杀手级应用”。
- en: Another area of industry activity that is well suited to blockchain’s advantages
    is the global supply chain and trade finance complex, which is discussed in chapter
    5\. Global supply chains function ponderously because of their reliance on paper-based
    processes and electronic data interchange (EDI) for transmitting documents. Conflicting
    information and lost documents lead to errors and slow down transaction approval,
    resulting in long lead times, lack of transparency concerning status and location
    of a specific shipment, and inefficient capital allocation. Chapter 5 discusses
    several supply chain blockchain pilots gaining traction. The discussion in this
    chapter spans the interconnection of supply chains, cross-border payments, trade
    financing, and marketplaces matching buyers and sellers. I discuss blockchain
    benefits for supply chain performance, from data consolidation and visibility
    to shipment tracking, enhancing transparency and trust in supply chain network
    data, monitoring shipments, and solving problems in real time.
