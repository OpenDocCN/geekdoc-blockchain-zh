    Ideally this will be an automatic withdrawal from your bank account into your

    for the potential of more reward (i.e., making money). Their monthly drip payment

    provide protection when the stock market goes down: you need less protection when
    you’re younger, and more when you’re getting ready to retire. You can keep a larger
    percentage in stocks if you’re comfortable with more risk, but try not to exceed
    the ratio of 75 percent/25 percent in either direction.'

    protection when the blockchain market is souring. Consider the investors who rode
    the blockchain boom of 2017, only to lose it all in 2018\. Those who converted
    their blockchain profits back into stocks and bonds (i.e., rebalanced their portfolios
    semiannually) protected their newfound wealth.

    total stock and bond markets while keeping a slice of the pie for blockchain investments.

    blockchain index fund, you can find new blockchain opportunities using qualitative
    analysis (research and judgment) and quantitative analysis (research and numbers),
