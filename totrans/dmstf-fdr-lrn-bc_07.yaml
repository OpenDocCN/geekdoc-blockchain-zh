- en: Today, attempts have been made to overcome entertainment objectives in the production
    of video games. In reality, much work has gone into seeking tools in computer
    science using AI and advanced technologies to develop games so that they can be
    used in educational, industry, or political processes. For these goods to be successfully
    introduced into society, they must be crafted to be as available as possible to
    all people, including those who belong to minorities with special needs. Adaptability
    and compatibility need to ensure better quality and adoption of goods to meet
    accessibility requirements. With demystifying federated learning in artificial
    intelligence, the possibilities of combining human-computer interaction with artificial
    intelligence to enhance usability in games, and thus to make them more democratic
    and useful to society, especially for those who rely on assistive technology services,
    are discussed in this chapter.

    with an emphasis on the interfaces between humans and computers (Whig et al.,
    2022). HCI researchers study how people interact with processors and create knowledge
    that allows humans to connect with computers in innovative ways.

- en: Human-computer interaction is a research subject that combines computer science,
    behavioral sciences, design, media studies, and numerous other disciplines. Stuart
    K. Card, Allen Newell, and Thomas P. Moran popularized the phrase in their landmark
    1983 book, The Thinking of Human with Computer Interaction, while the authors
    originally used the word in 1980 and the earliest documented usage was in 1975\.
    The phrase implies that, in contrast to other instruments with restricted applications,
    a computer has numerous uses, which occur as an open-ended conversation between
    the user and the computer. The concept of dialogue compares human-computer interaction
    to human with the human conversation, which is important for theoretical concerns
    in the subject (Anand et al., 2022).

    between humans and the computers they use is critical to allow this connection.
    Desktop programs, web browsers, portable computers, and computer kiosks all make
    use of today's popular graphical user interfaces (GUI) (Chopra & Whig, 2022).
    Voice user interfaces (VUI) are utilized in voice recognition and synthesis systems
    and developing multi-modal and gestalt User Interfaces (GUI) enable people to
    interact with embodied character agents in ways that conventional interface paradigms
    cannot. In its history, the HCI field has grown in terms of interaction quality
    and branching (George et al., 2021). Rather than building traditional interfaces,
    several study disciplines have focused on concepts like multimodality versus mono
    modality, intelligent adaptive interfaces against command/action based interfaces,
    and active versus passive interfaces. (Mamza, 2021).

    (ACM) as “a field concerned with the design, development, and implementation of
    interactive computing systems for human use, as well as the study of key phenomena
    surrounding them.” Securing user happiness is an essential aspect of HCI (Sinha
    & Ranjan, 2015). “Because human-computer interaction investigates the interaction
    of a human and a machine, it depends on supporting information from both the machine
    and the human side. On the machine side, techniques in computer graphics, operating
    systems, programming languages, and development environments are important. (Parihar
    & Yadav, 2022.).

    linguistics, social sciences, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and human
    factors like computer user satisfaction are all vital. Of course, engineering
    and design approaches are important (Bhargav & Whig, 2021). People from many backgrounds
    contribute to the success of HCI due to its interdisciplinary character. Human-machine
    interaction (HCI) is also known as HMI, man-machine interaction (MMI), and computer-human
    interaction (CHI) (Khera et al., 2021).

    user and the computer. The engagement with a computer in such a conversation does
    not necessitate a great deal of cognitive work on the part of the user. We assist
    our consumers in using machines to solve their issues when we invest a lot of
    work into creating effective human-computer interfaces (verma, 2019; Whig, 2019c;
    Whig & Ahmad, 2019). In contrast, failure to pay attention to human-computer interaction
    nearly invariably leads to the creation of poor user interfaces. Poor HCI leads
    to poor usability, which raises the likelihood of product failure.

    HCI examines how people behave, interact with technology, and what their wants

    their personality, experience, motivation, and emotions (Arun Velu, 2021). It
    is critical in today's modern, highly competitive industry to provide the greatest
    possible customer experience. Not unexpectedly, user-centered design (a method
    in which designers focus on users and their requirements at every stage of the
    design process) is critical in the design process.

    Human-computer interaction is influenced not just by the tasks that users do with
    gadgets, but also by the context in which such actions occur. The context specifies
    the real circumstances in which the computer system is employed. For example,
    when designing a mobile app, you must consider how the visual design will seem
    in both dim lighting and sun glare, as well as whether the app will function properly
    in the event of a bad internet connection. These are only two of the numerous
    factors that may influence user experience (Sharma et al., 2016).
