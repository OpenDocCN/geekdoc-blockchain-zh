- en: 'This research measures the disruption in accounting triggered by emerging technology:
    blockchain technology (BT). It analyzes its role in accounting with accounting
    professionals’ awareness of these technologies and its impact over their working.
    It also measures the advantages and challenges of adopting BT in accounting. For
    that purpose, it explores the possibility of accounting professionals’ perception
    after collecting data through the opinion survey method. To analysis data, *t*-test
    with SPSS software was used. For testing the reliability of collected data through
    opinion survey, Cronbach’s alpha reliability test has been conducted. The study
    concluded that accounting professions are aware of these technologies. Results
    also show that BT makes real-time accounting possible soon. Results revealed that
    this technology may improve monopoly of the big corporation. The study revealed
    that professionals’ perceived mind-set may become a big challenge to adopt BT
    in accounting.'

    technology (BT) [[1](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_001), [2](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_002),
    [3](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_003), [4](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_004)]. Technological
    progress has been a significant contributor to the global economy, bringing fundamental
    changes in our lives [[5](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_005), [6](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_006)].
    The benefits and drawbacks of this approach are special. BT basically reworks
    how we live, work and communicate with each other [[7](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_007)].
    KPMG 2018 reports that the US CEO.

    assume that the three most-discussed innovations, cloud computing, AI and blockchain,
    also have a significant influence [[8](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_008), [9](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_009)].
    In accordance with these systems, information on demand is exchanged, activity
    management is streamlined, risky business transactions are detected and controlled
    transaction concerns and market concerns are recognized [[10](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_010)].
    Blockchain is the abovementioned technology that affects each economic area, but
    it can be totally disrupted in the accounting and audit sector because of the
    features of the technology [[11](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_011), [12](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_012)].

    is programmable to monitor not only financial transactions but also nearly all
    valuables [[13](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_013)]. In blockchain technology, we have
    a chain of blocks that includes a digital signature, timelines and information,
    which are then replicated to all nodes on the distributed network and is protected
    and unchanging from cryptography. Blockchain has the ability to improve the productivity
    of the accounting industry by reducing the expense of storing and reconciling
    accounts, offering full clarity about ownership and asset records. Blockchain
    may allow accountants to become transparent about their organizations’ finances
    and responsibilities and also provide opportunities to focus on preparation and
    assessment instead of recordkeeping [[14](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_014), [15](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_015),
    [16](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_016)].

    better the position of BT. Nakamoto [[17](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_017)] offers
    a solely peer form of electronic cash that will allow for direct online transfers
    without going through a financial institution from one party to another. The coins
    made from digital signatures have been launched by the normal system, which offers
    good ownership protection but is incomplete without avoiding replication. Therefore,
    they suggested a two-way approach via a peer-to-peer network [[18](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_018)].
    They also argued that the chance was lost. Blockchain technologies will evolve
    as a big improvement in accounting as double-entry accounting evolves and becomes
    available [[19](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_019), [20](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_020)].
    Although double entry has been the increasingly for several years, it seems unbelievable
    that this is so as the pledge of blockchain innovations approaches the truth of
    their transformational potential in terms of a change toward triple entry. The
    objectives of the paper include examination of the futuristic role of blockchain
    technology in accounting, study the knowledge of blockchain-based accounting accounts
    accountant professionals and recognize socioeconomic obstacles, benefits and barriers
    to technology-based blockchain accounting acceptance.

    [2](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_002)]. A mechanical, permanent, global, lead can
    be interpreted as capturing transactions in real time in the temporal sense [[3](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_003),
    [4](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_004)]. The Internet of money is also known as blockchain
    [[5](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_005), [6](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_006), [7](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_007)].
    Blockchain technology’s first deployment is the popular “Bitcoin” cryptocurrency.
    Cryptocurrencies allow people to anonymously store their money and make transfers
    without brokers such as banks. This simplifies money transfer and shopping even
    more easily and efficiently. Therefore, blockchain offers broad financial framework
    architecture [[8](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_008), [9](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_009)].
    That is, you can efficiently store and transfer capital. In reality, all sorts
    of financial assets, stocks, bonds, futures, commodities and immovables can be
    handled and transacted on blockchains easily in contrast to conventional device
    implementations [[10](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_010), [11](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_011),
    [12](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_012)]. The supply chain management [[4](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_004),
    [21](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_021)] is another significant application of blockchain
    technology. A significant number of organizations are now involved in designing
    blockchain technologies for real-time distribution management and tracking of
    the sources and conditions of products that join their supply chains [[14](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_014),
    [15](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_015), [16](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_016)]. This
    will aid with verifying the product origin and life cycle. Establish trust in
    the system, deter abuse and boost performance for providers and customers [[13](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_013)].
    The authenticity test function of blockchain is so critical that some unique examples
    are given including talking of products of luxury [[2](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_002),
    [17](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_017)]. Blockchain diamonds are forever true and
    so. The first areas in which blockchain projects advance in the areas of openness,
    protection and trust are works of art and other items of high value. Obviously,
    such efficiencies can be of considerable benefit by minimizing counterfeiting
    and encouraging improved corporate practices in the luxury goods industry [[18](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_018),
    [19](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_019), [20](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_020)]. This
    is a very creative product. A blockchain feature for the protected registry is
    that a time-stamped blockchain archive can register all kinds of copyright patents
    or trademarks in an intellectual property [[22](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_022),
    [23](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_023), [24](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_024)]. Thus,
    we can search for the legitimacy of virtually any commodity with blockchain. Another
    big area of use for blockchain is digital identity. The theory of the blockchain
    platform and technology is focused around the existence of blockchain as a pioneer
    for Bitcoin transactions, suggesting it is a true accounting mechanism for encoding,
    storing and publishing transactions details in Bitcoin technically [[5](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_005),
    [6](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_006), [8](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_008)]. As blockchain
    can carry currency transactions without any intermediary trusted third party,
    notice that currency exchanges are one of the best fields of financial interactions,
    it can also carry any form of property transactions, such as equities, shares
    and mortgages [[6](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_006), [7](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_007)].
    The accounting practitioners are primarily interested in the calculation, coordination
    and review of financial reports. Often, accountants are concerned with assessing
    or calculating land rights and responsibilities, or with managing the best financial
    services should be distributed [[12](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_012), [13](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_013),
    [15](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_015)]. Using blockchain technologies, accountants
    have information on their organizations’ limited financial capital and responsibilities
    and use limited data, concentrating on preparation and assessment, rather than
    paperwork. This technology will improve accounting by lowering accountancy costs
    [[2](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_002), [21](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_021)]. Their
    extensive expertise is also important. BT is factual for land ownership and wealth
    history [[25](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_025), [26](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_026),
    [27](#b_9783110702507-006_ref_027)].

- en: The opinion of the respondents has been collected by means of an online opinion
    polling tool to carry out current research on BT-based accounting. We submitted
    700 replies (out of 650), all from different accounting careers, that is, Academics,
    academic scientists among others, charted accountants (CA). Descriptive reports
    are provided for data analysis. “Cronbach’s alpha” was used with a score of 0.791
    to measure accuracy and trustworthiness of opinion. Additional sample t verification
    of the hypothesis has been used. For the study, emails and social media, are included
    with questionnaire on google forms. In addition, the respondents were asked to
    send on their contacts the questionnaire for their views to further extend the
    reach of the analysis. The questionnaire used in the opinion poll showed the demographic
    responses and the questions of the age, gender and career of the respondent; digital
    technologies referred to general questions relating to the experience of the respondents
    and the understanding of new technological advancement in the accounting profession.

    the measured survey statistics for acknowledging the technical development and
    technical effect on accounts (as *p* < 0.05) at 5% of importance. Furthermore,
    the respondents decided on the knowledge with BT technologies that they were ignorant
    of the negative distance being negligible (*p* > 0.05) as (*t*[mean difference] = −0.38).

    it enhances authenticity of accounting records (adv_tech_inn_3) since making change
    in the written work will not be easy, thus the record made will be more authentic;
    it enhance transparency in accounting records (adv_tech_inn_5), the use of BT
    will not only enhance the authenticity but also the transparency as the requirement
    will always be understood by the maker and in case of any type of ambiguity further
    with the use of the BT the cost of the accounting and auditing (adv_tech_inn_6)
    can also be minimized as the system will help in minimizing the errors and sometime
    stop wrong entries and will provide the auditor with check within the computerized
    environment reducing the time and efforts.

    technology as perceived data security (barriers_BT_2) is the major barrier in
    front of the use of BT, further perceived mind-sets of accounting and auditing
    professionals (barriers_BT_5) will not be changed with the use of the technology
    and the old experience professionals do not wish to change and easily adopt it
    as other technologies. Furthermore, lack of technical skills and training (barriers_BT_7)
    is the major barrier in front of use of any technology including the BT, thus
    the success of the adoption of BT depends upon proper training.

- en: The use of disruptive technologies such as BT is very important in a computerized
    period of accountability. It is important that accountants are acquainted with
    these technologies to make effective use of those technologies. BT plays a key
    role in accounting. Results also conclude that accountants think that these technologies
    interrupt the accounting profession, but they do not that they interrupt accounting
    due to the lack of technical skills. It further showed that with the adoption
    of the technology, the socioeconomic benefits and socioeconomic benefits of BT
    technology for the accounting and auditing industry are insignificant differences
    in barriers to BT acceptance. BT’s greatest advantage is that it can provide real-time
    accounting. Results reveal that in 5–10 years, this technology may disrupt the
    accounting profession.
