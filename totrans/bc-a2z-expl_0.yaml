    to guess a Blockchain term that has not been covered and explained by us. We promised
    that the network members who will come up with interesting Blockchain terms will
    be duly acknowledged and the corresponding terms will be featured in this book.
    Mentioned below are the terms and their contributors. These terms have been explained
    in their respective sections. Thanks Brendan, Chiranjib, Harsha, Khalifa, Mark
    and Sunil for your contributions. contributions.contributions.contributions.contributions.contributions.contributions.contributions.Preface Blockchain
    is catching the attention of masses all over the world, thanks to the spotlight
    on Bitcoin – the first successful commercial implementation of Blockchain. Adoption
    of Blockchain both for Public use and Enterprise use is growing by leaps and bounds. While
    there are many resources that are available in the form of books, online courses
    and certification programs that equip one to understand Blockchain and use cases,
    there are very limited resources to explain key terms and lexicon used in Blockchain.
    Hence, we made the bold effort to scan the history of Blockchain, trace evolution
    of Blockchain, mine for terms that are used both frequently and rarely and explain
    them clearly. Our efforts have resulted in collating over 400 terms, yes you have
    read it correctly; and explaining them in simple and lucid manner. We expect this
    book to be a comprehensive compendium of Blockchain terms and evolve into a valuable
    resource for everyone, be it – Students, Academicians, Researchers, Blockchain
    Practitioners, Crypto enthusiasts, who are interested in learning and mastering
    Blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, other re-sources that are available
    either online or offline, cover and explain at best 30 to 50 terms. In essence,
    our book provides 10x value compared to those resources. This book also acknowledges
    and explains key contributors to Blockchain, top-20 cryptocurrencies and leading
    Blockchain protocols. No wonder, we feel that readers of this book will graduate
    from Blockchain Dummies to Blockchain Pros by assimilating all the terms listed
    in this book, from A to Z!! We promise that this book will continue to be a valuable
    resource over the years through inclusion of new jargons and terms as they appear
    on the horizon and covering them in subsequent editions. Happy reading and sharing!!!Foreword C.P.
    Gurnani MD & CEO, Tech Mahindra Blockchain, undoubtedly, is the technology that
    has caught every CEO’s attention globally. No other emerging technology has stirred
    such a massive and disruptive interest than what Blockchain has been able to garner
    in recent years. Be it on account of Bitcoin, the first commercial application
    of Blockchain technology, or its innate immense potential to transform numerous
    business processes and services that touch our daily lives. In the Cryptocurrency
    world, Blockchain has not only spawned the Bitcoin network but also nurtured myriad
    other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and several others that
    are changing the world, as we speak. Blockchain has also triggered the advent
    of fundamentally new applications and business models such as Non Fungible Tokens
    (NFTs) which ushered in a new trend of Crypto or Digital collectibles. In the
    world of Enterprise applications, Blockchain has demonstrated its potential to
    transform:  Supply Chains by making them anti-fragile, Payments and International
    Money Remittances through Stablecoins and Central Bank Digital Currencies Trade
    Finance by empowering networks to perform automated & immutable invoice discounting Digital
    Identities by securing them via Self Sovereign Identities and; Media & Entertainment
    industry by configuring self-executing Contracts & Rights Management. In Government
    to Citizens services, Blockchain has demonstrated significant potential to promote
    much required transparency in Benefits Administration, Title Management and even
    in Elections & Voting management. Foreseeing these transformative trends, we officially
    launched the Blockchain Practice at Tech Mahindra in May 2018 under the able leadership
    of Rajesh. He is our ‘Go to Guy’ for all things pertaining to Blockchain in our
    company. I personally think Rajesh has a unique quality of creating value in chaotic
    and uncertain circumstances. In the early days of Blockchain the technology adoption
    was unclear because regulators globally were either supporting or banning cryptocurrency
    every other month and Blockchain was related only to Cryptocurrencies. Albeit,
    Rajesh and his team were able to bring in a vision to find practical and meaningful
    applications for our various clients across the Globe. In 2019, the TRAI UCC regulation
    was a defining moment for Tech Mahindra’s Blockchain Unit. In a world full of
    skeptics and critics of this technology, Rajesh was able to lead not only his
    team but also technical and business representatives in the Indian Telecommunications
    ecosystem to establish the World’s Largest & Multi Cloud Blockchain network to
    insulate end customers from Commercial calls and texts. I am proud to say our
    blockchain competency is recognized globally for the investment, thought leadership
    and intellectual property created through research and execution of large scale
    projects. My most cherished recognition is 2021 Forbes Top 50 Blockchain Companies
    for Tech Mahindra. Some other recognitions include 6th Annual NASSCOM Technology
    Award and Hyperledger Certified Service Provider badge. For Rajesh, giving back
    to the society is as important as revenue generation. I am always excited to invest
    in his ideas for Blockchain skills development and enhancement. As a matter of
    fact, at TechM, in his first 180 days tenure in the company, Rajesh had run over
    8 Hyperledger Fabric and Corda classroom trainings across locations in India with
    over 350 technical participants. He also led the foundation and execution of Blockchain
    District with State Government of Telangana for Blockchain policy and start up
    ecosystem development. I am so happy to see him continuing his journey to contribute
    to enhancement of Blockchain Knowledge through this book which I believe is a
    unique collection of over 400 terms and Blockchain lexicon and also first of its
    kind globally. This book is not just culmination of the efforts of Rajesh Dhuddu
    and Co-Author Srinivas Mahankali but also has active inputs and contributions
    from our blockchain team members - Amey Rajput, Dharmen Dhulla and Aman Malhotra. My
    bet on Rajesh as a Blockchain leader has yielded good results and I am sure his
    and the team’s work in this book will be a knowledge enriching read for all those
    who are keen to advance their learning and master Blockchain.Praise & Review for
    Blockchain A to Z Explained An essential glossary for those wanting to learn about
    Blockchain, or for those already in the industry looking to expand their knowledge.
    Rajesh and team have covered everything from Air Drops to ZKPs. You’ll soon be
    serenading colleagues and friends with tales of Bear Whales and Block Rewards;
    Doges and DIDs; Hashing and HODLing... you get the point. If anyone out there
    knows 100% of these terms before reading this, send them straight to me! Anthony
    Day, Blockchain Partner, IBM Blockchain body of knowledge is growing very fast.
    Every day there are new developments, technical advancements and ofcourse emergence
    of new words. To keep pace with all these, it is quintessential that one understands
    the technical terms easily. Infact, I have been looking for one book that I can
    refer to, pretty much like good old days’ dictionary that explains everything
    lucidly. I am delighted that my search for such a valuable resource has ended
    with this book. Tina Singh, Chief Digital Officer, Mahindra Finance Blockchain
    is an important driver of Digital Transformation. To understand its role fully,
    its pertinent to understand its concepts, latest developments and terminology.
    This book will help all Blockchain learners – whether students or professionals
    to overcome the lack of understanding of Blockchain jargon and in turns fosters
    good learning and mastery of the subject. Dr Srinivas Pingali – Professor of Practice,
    IIM Udaipur Blockchain is at the vanguard of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
    However, to understand the “why”, it is first imperative to understand the “what”.
    Understanding “what’’ is heavily contingent on understanding various Blockchain
    glossary & jargon. This book does exactly that, explaining everything in a comprehensive
    and engaging manner. Separating the signal from the noise, Rajesh & Srinivas gives
    readers a comprehensive reference tool to not only appreciate the building ‘blocks’
    of this disruptive technology, but also its significance and impact. Purushottam
    Kaushik – Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution India, The World Economic
    Forum Blockchain is the most disruptive technology during the last ten years.
    Yet a lot of concepts pertaining to blockchain technology are still too difficult
    to understand. There are many terms in use that might be foreign / alien to software
    developers and IT professionals. This book provides simple explanations for all
    blockchain terms. This book makes it possible to fully understand the intricate
    details about blockchain technologies. I am confident that this book will enable
    a much broader adoption of blockchain technology among enterprises. A must read
    for anyone interested in learning more about various use cases of blockchain technology. Ted
    Kim, Sr Vice President, Samsung SDS With bitcoin as its first commercial application
    in 2008, blockchain has continued to make the headlines across industries and
    geographies. This has introduced new blockchain jargon and complex terminology
    which has only grown over the years. This masterpiece will have you well covered.
    From learning about ‘Bakong’ to ‘Bear Whale’ to ‘Atomic Swaps’ and lots more,
    you cannot but marvel at the mere exhaustiveness of the terms and topics explained
    in a simple to learn language. I have no doubt that this thesaurus will make readers
    the smartest blockchain geeks going around, in the shortest possible time. Indeed,
    this book will be your quintessential go-to source for all that’s ‘Blockchain’! Rajesh
    Chandiramani, Sr VP – Digital Business, Tech MahindraAdvance Comments on A2Z Glossary Professor
    Lisa Short DUniv., Grad. Cert Sc., Bch T&D, Dip. T&A Sys., Adv. Dip. OHS, BA (Economics,
    Geog., Fin. Mgt.) Dip. Ed. Founder, P&L Digital Edge Ltd [UK] and Mind Shifting The
    speed of digital change is so great that we now have ‘revolutions’ that take less
    time than a generation. Blockchain is a foundational technology of the Fourth
    Industrial Revolution that has jettisoned us into Society 5.0 and onto a vertiginous
    transformation curve that for some sectors is forty times faster than it was a
    year ago. It is heralded along with Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of
    Everything as shifting simple networks based on how we connect and transfer information
    to smart networks that have the capacity to transfer value. It isn’t just about
    speed and efficiency; it is about changing behaviour, redefining, and redesigning
    the way we conduct business and are enabled to live our lives. Blockchain is about
    valorising trust. Created in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial and trust
    crisis, it has become the building block of a brave new world where we have replaced
    our fundamental sense of governance and assurance with a technology that to be
    honest many don’t understand. But blockchain technology is an enabler and becomes
    an engine of inclusion that supports our economic and social systems including
    climate change and inequity. It can provide an identity to the greater than 2
    billion people who cannot participate in the financial system. In doing so it
    converts fragmented communities, to educated, financially included ‘thinkers and
    doers’ who can transform nations and support their future. If people don’t understand
    blockchain they can’t participate in its ability to empower and enable us, and
    perhaps more importantly, us empower it. It is incumbent upon influencers, industry
    leaders, educators, and credible experts, like me and the authors of this book
    who’ve got the knowledge that converges experience, pragmatism, and developmental
    know-how to share our wisdom in such a way so that adoption becomes ubiquitous. Wisdom
    is not devoid of curiosity, effort, lifelong learning, and the joy of seeing the
    benefits of technology develop. I was not born a digital native. I can remember
    buying that first computer for my children in the 1990’s, turning it on and seeing
    that green flashing ‘dash’ of a DOS based computing system and thinking this is
    grand, now what do I do? To be honest, I had absolutely no idea. Everyone I knew
    was in the same boat, so we muddled through together. The point is, we did, and
    we continued to learn, through trial and error and even floundered our way through
    dial up internet, floppy drives, disc drives, USB’s, and CD’s. Apples became computers
    not a piece of fruit, phones turned from bricks to essential pocket-sized accessories
    and laptops became something that empowered life away from a desk. Not so many
    years ago I remember reaching out to a colleague to ask them on earth was It was
    the era of the Initial Coin Offerings [ICO’s] and there was lots of technical
    banter on social media and developer networks. There was a vast and seemingly
    never-ending lexicon of new terms, words and processes that made me feel like
    I was in a Kafkaesque nightmare experiencing my worst ever episode of imposter
    syndrome as I was back in that place of having absolutely no idea. Ruminations
    about the potential of blockchain were overshadowed by the hype of failed ICO’s
    and the cryptocurrency explosion. It certainly wasn’t the gracious introduction
    such an amazing technology deserved and created a great deal of confusion, misinformation,
    and misunderstanding. Had I had a resource that was a simple explainer of any
    name, term, acronym [and there are hundreds of them] and processes it would have
    made my journey much easier. This book does just that. It is not just a listed
    reference text, it represents an ontology of the author’s priceless years of experience
    and learning and collaboration in the industry so that a clear contextual understanding
    of blockchain can be obtained in one place. If someone can understand the language,
    they will know the questions to ask to be included. Rajesh Dhuddu is recognised
    as making blockchain relevant for the common person. Srinivas Mahankali is focused
    on enabling easy adoption of blockchain across the world. Together their experience,
    thought leadership and technical prowess are the reason our paths initially crossed.
    But it is the impact of their project delivery on society and the multidisciplinary
    approach they take which led me to know that this A to Z of blockchain is a lexicon
    that would be as pragmatic as they are and a resource that every business, decision
    maker, student, parent, leader, educator, and journalist should include as a ‘must
    have’. I am resolute that until the hype and misinformation is corrected, and
    terminology understood that the vertical rise in enlightenment cannot occur. Education
    and access to credible resources are the front door key to blockchain adoption. Less
    than 3% of senior academics, government decision makers and board members have
    science and technology expertise and there is only a fraction of those with a
    knowledge of blockchain. To quote the French Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire
    I know is that most people talking about blockchain, know nothing about Never
    truer word was uttered. This book offers them, and all small to medium enterprises
    who constitute 99% of the global economy a coalescence of a simple explanations
    of everything from a POET to a whale to eliminate the arcane language in the industry
    that can confuse even the best of us. The A to Z of Blockchain is an important
    reference text because blockchain terminology can be unduly complicated and highly
    complex. That becomes a barrier to navigating the exciting frontier of a foundational
    technology where we can embed innovative ideas and solutions to create a human-centered
    smart society. Blockchain isn’t just a technology, it is a philosophy, and everyone
    needs to know about the type of systemic changes it can affect and the industries
    it can disrupt, if you want the systems of the future to work for you. Professor
    Lisa Short is recognised as one of the top 150 thought leaders in the world and
    top 50 leaders and influencers in the world to follow for her work in blockchain,
    crypto assets and EdTech and is at the driving force of digital technology ecosystems.Errata We

    Sc., Bch T&D, Dip. T&A Sys., Adv. Dip. OHS, BA (Economics, Geog., Fin. Mgt.) Dip.
    Ed. Founder, P&L Digital Edge Ltd [UK] and Mind Shifting The speed of digital
    change is so great that we now have ‘revolutions’ that take less time than a generation.
    Blockchain is a foundational technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution that
    has jettisoned us into Society 5.0 and onto a vertiginous transformation curve
    that for some sectors is forty times faster than it was a year ago. It is heralded
    along with Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Everything as shifting
    simple networks based on how we connect and transfer information to smart networks
    that have the capacity to transfer value. It isn’t just about speed and efficiency;
    it is about changing behaviour, redefining, and redesigning the way we conduct
    business and are enabled to live our lives. Blockchain is about valorising trust.
    Created in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial and trust crisis, it has
    become the building block of a brave new world where we have replaced our fundamental
    sense of governance and assurance with a technology, that to be honest, many don’t
    understand. Blockchain technology is an enabler and becomes an engine of inclusion
    that supports our economic and social systems including climate change and inequity.
    It can provide an identity to greater than 2 billion people who cannot participate
    in financial systems. In doing so it converts fragmented communities, to educated,
    financially included ‘thinkers and doers’ who can transform nations and support
    their future. If people don’t understand blockchain they can’t participate in
    its ability to empower and enable us. Thus, it is incumbent upon influencers,
    industry leaders, educators, and credible experts, like me and the authors of
    this book who’ve got the knowledge that converges experience, pragmatism, and
    developmental know-how to share our wisdom in such a way that adoption becomes
    ubiquitous. Wisdom is not devoid of curiosity, effort, lifelong learning, and
    the joy of seeing the benefits of technology develop. I was not born a digital
    native. I can remember buying that first computer for my children in the 1990’s,
    turning it on and seeing that green flashing ‘dash’ of a DOS based computing system
    and thinking this is grand, now what do I do? To be honest, I had absolutely no
    idea. Everyone I knew was in the same boat, so we muddled through together. The
    point is, we did, and we continued to learn, through trial and error and even
    floundered our way through dial up internet, floppy drives, disc drives, USBs,
    and CDs. Apples became computers not a piece of fruit, phones turned from bricks
    to essential pocket-sized accessories and laptops became something that empowered
    life away from a desk. Not so many years ago I remember reaching out to a colleague
    to ask them “What on earth was blockchain?”. It was the era of the Initial Coin
    Offerings (ICOs) and there was lots of technical banter on social media and developer
    networks. There was a vast and seemingly never-ending lexicon of new terms, words
    and processes that made me feel like I was in a Kafkaesque nightmare experiencing
    my worst ever episode of imposter syndrome as I was back in that place of having
    absolutely no idea. Ruminations about the potential of Blockchain were overshadowed
    by the hype of failed ICOs and the cryptocurrency explosion. It certainly wasn’t
    the gracious introduction of such an amazing technology and created a great deal
    of confusion, misinformation, and misunderstanding. I had a resource that was
    a simple explainer of any name, term, acronym (and there are hundreds of them)
    and processes it would have made my journey much easier. This book does just that.
    It is not just a listed reference text, it represents an ontology of the author’s
    priceless years of experience and learning and collaboration in the industry so
    that a clear contextual understanding of blockchain can be obtained in one place.
    If someone can understand the language, they will know the questions to ask to
    be included. Rajesh Dhuddu is recognised globally as making blockchain relevant
    for the common person. Srinivas Mahankali is focused on enabling easy adoption
    of blockchain across the world. Together their experience, thought leadership
    and technical prowess are the reason our paths initially crossed. But it is the
    impact of their project delivery on society and the multidisciplinary approach
    they take which led me to know that this A to Z of blockchain is a lexicon that
    would be as pragmatic as they are and a resource that every business, decision
    maker, student, parent, leader, educator, and journalist should include as a ‘must
    have’. I am resolute that until the hype and misinformation is corrected, and
    terminology understood that the vertical rise in enlightenment cannot occur. Education
    and access to credible resources are the front door key to blockchain adoption. Less
    than 3% of senior academics, government decision makers and board members have
    science and technology expertise and there is only a fraction of those with knowledge
    of blockchain. To quote the French Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire “all I know
    is that most people talking about blockchain, know nothing about blockchain!”.
    Never truer word was uttered. This book offers them, and all small to medium enterprises
    who constitute 99% of the global economy a coalescence of a simple explanations
    of everything from a POET to a whale to eliminate the arcane language in the industry
    that can confuse even the best of us. This book is an important reference text
    because blockchain terminology can be unduly complicated and highly complex; that
    becomes a barrier to navigating the exciting frontier of a foundational technology
    where we can embed innovative ideas and solutions to create a human-centered smart
    society. Blockchain isn’t just a technology, it is a philosophy, and everyone
    needs to know about the type of systemic changes it can affect and the industries
    it can disrupt, if you want the systems of the future to work for you. Professor
    Lisa Short is recognised as one of the top 150 thought leaders in the world and
    top 50 leaders and influencers in the world to follow for her work in Blockchain,
    Crypto assets and EdTech and is the driving force of digital technology ecosystems.CHAPTER
    1 A Adam Back He is a well known Cypherpunk, Cryptographer and widely recognized
    for his invention Hashcash a protocol that is used to identify email spam and
    control it. He proposed Hashcash in 1997 which was used by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s
    inventor, to develop Proof of Work (PoW) consensus protocol. PoW is used in Bitcoin
    network as part of mining algorithm. He is also known as one of the first two
    people contacted by Satoshi Nakamoto for developing Bitcoin protocol. Adam Back
    is currently the CEO of Blockstream, a company that he co-founded in 2014\. Blockstream
    is focused on building crypto financial infrastructure based on Bitcoin. Address In
    Blockchain world, an address would typically be a hashed version of the “public
    key”, which will be referred to by an individual or a platform, in order to transfer
    any cryptocurrency to a wallet. It is a combination of unique numbers and letters
    and works similar to an email address. Its like a bank account for cryptocurrency
    asset. In a public blockchain, address can also be used to perform analytics on
    a wallet as it is sufficient to trace assets in the wallet. In Bitcoin world,
    different address formats are used. Eg: P2PKH (addresses start with number 1)
    - 1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2\. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Also
    known by its original name Rijndael, Advanced Encryption Standard was developed
    by two Belgian cryptographers Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen. It is based on a
    design principle known as substitution - permutation network, made popular in
    2001\. Development started in 1997 when the need for alternate to Digital Encryption
    Standard (DES) was felt as DES was beginning to become vulnerable to brute force
    attacks. It is used in Software and Hardware globally to protect sensitive data
    in areas of government computer security, cybersecurity and electronic data protection.
    3 different versions are available AES 128, AES 192 and AES 256\. 128, 192 and
    256 represent the key length that is used to encrypt and decrypt information.
    AES 128 uses 128 bit key length. Air Drop Air Drop is a popular marketing campaign
    or technique used in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) whereby a certain allotment
    of the native cryptocurrency (tokens) is set aside for free distribution and given
    to contributors and the community in general. This is mostly done to increase
    awareness, create early value for tokens as recipients will begin to trade their
    airdropped tokens. It also promotes participation in ICOs, Blockchain network
    or enhance activities on the platform. Cryptocurrency start-ups have traditionally
    airdropped tokens to the wallet holders on Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. Uniswap
    (UNI) airdrop is believed to be one of the most lucrative airdrops in recent times. Air
    Gapping When an individual or an entity is highly concerned about the security
    of any sensitive data or valuable asset held digitally like tokens and cryptocurrencies,
    they typically ensure physical separation of their devices from unsecure networks.
    This helps prevent likely cyberattacks that originate from unsecured networks
    or unauthorized access. Alan Turing Regarded as the Father of Modern Computer
    Science, Alan Mathison Turing’s work led to the origin of Turing completeness.
    In the Blockchain world, Turing completeness means that the protocol is able to
    use its code base to perform any task as long as it has correct instructions,
    enough time and processing power. In essence, it allows writing programming loops.
    Turing completeness became prominent when Ethereum claimed it is Turing complete
    while Bitcoin is not. In reality, Bitcoin is Turing complete. Turing completeness
    helps to protect the data to avoid possible information thefts, enhances security
    of the system from hackers and offers safe transaction system. Alt Coins / Alt
    Tokens/ Alternate Coins They represent all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.
    There are various attributes that differentiate alternate coins from Bitcoin such
    as Consensus mechanism, Smart Contracts, Low price volatility or no volatility
    at all. There are more than 10,000 alternate coins trading in over 350 exchanges
    globally Anti-Fragile An anti-fragile asset performs better when there is risk
    and uncertainty, and gains strength from adverse events. This concept was created
    by the famous author Nasim Nicholas Taleb. He said that “some things benefit from
    shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder,
    and stresses and love adventure, risk and uncertainty”. A classic example is Bitcoin
    (BTC), it has become stronger with every price hit it has suffered over the years. API
    (Application Programming Interface) An Application Programming Interface allows
    any system to fetch from or push data to a third-party system. Prevalence of APIs
    has opened multiple possibilities across segments. In Banking, Open API Banking
    has resulted in creation of many innovative products & services by Fintechs and
    Banks leading to improved customer engagement, enhanced transaction security and
    increased convenience. Ashdraked Ashdraking is a complete loss of a crypto investor’s
    capital as a result of shorting Bitcoin where the aim is to sell Bitcoin at a
    higher price and buy it back at lower price. The term is named after “Lord Ashdrake”,
    a pseudonymous Romanian Bitcoin trader who used to short Bitcoin - betting that
    its value would decline. Initially he made large profits as Bitcoin declined in
    2014 - 2015\. Then he shorted Bitcoin at $300 expecting prices to drop. On the
    contrary, Bitcoin prices went upto $600 in a few weeks and he lost lots of money. ASIC
    (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) An Application Specific Integrated Circuit
    is particularly built for a specific computational use rather than being general-purpose.
    These have become very popular and are used in mining cryptocurrencies as mining
    on personal computers is difficult. They are more efficient than General Processing
    Units (GPUs). Once a cryptocurrency specific ASIC is released, mining without
    ASIC is usually unprofitable. Asymmetric Keys Asymmetric keys is the use of two
    distinct or separate public and private keys (keys are different and not same
    as is the case with Symmetric keys). Public key is used for encryption and this
    can be decrypted only by a private key. Public and Private keys are mathematically
    connected with each other and their relationship differs from one algorithm to
    another. These keys in cryptocurrencies ensure that transaction sources are legitimate
    and hackers cannot steal the funds. In Bitcoin, the wallet address is a hashed
    version of the corresponding public key. It proves the ownership of address to
    receive funds / tokens / coins. ATH (All Time High) All Time High for a cryptocurrency
    or any stock price is the maximum price that the asset has reached as on current
    date. For Eg, Bitcoin reached an ATH of USD 19,783 in 2017 and then an ATH of
    USD 61,712 in March, 2021\. ATL (All Time Low) All Time Low is the lowest price
    of a cryptocurrency or any stock till date. This is used as a measure to understand
    the performance of an asset and the relative changes in the price. Atomic Swaps An
    atomic swap is when two cryptocurrencies can be traded amongst each other i.e.
    converted from one into another without the intervention of a third-party platform
    or exchange. They are made wallet to wallet in a fully person to person manner.
    They are called atomic as it results in either successful completion of swap and
    each trader receives the other’s funds or nothing happens with both traders keeping
    their respective funds. Tier Nolan who accomplished this in 2013 is widely considered
    as inventor of atomic swaps. The first atomic swap was established between Bitcoin
    and Litecoin. ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) The purpose of ABCI (Application
    Blockchain Interface) is to provide a clean interface between any finite, deterministic
    state transition machine on one computer and the mechanics of a blockchain-based
    replication engine across multiple computers also known as consensus engine. AKS
    (Azure Kubernetes Service) AKS is an open-source fully managed container orchestration
    service available on the Microsoft Azure public cloud that can be used to deploy,
    scale and manage Docker containers and container-based applications in a cluster
    environment. It helps in setting up and managing containerized applications in
    seconds and was released on 8th March 2019\.CHAPTER 2 B B money B-money was one
    of the earliest cryptocurrencies, which was never launched officially. B-money
    endeavored to provide many of the same services and features (anonymous, distributed
    cash system) that cryptocurrencies of today provide. It was invented by Wei Dai.
    He is a member of Cypherpunks and co proposed VMAC message authentication algorithm.
    The smallest unit of Ether is named as Wei in his honor. 1 Wei is one quintillionth
    of an Ether. BAAS (Blockchain As A Service) BAAS is the third-party creation and
    management of cloud based networks for companies in the business of building blockchain
    applications. These third-party services are a relatively new development in the
    growing field of blockchain technology. IBM, AWS, Azure, Oracle, SAP, Alibaba,
    Stezy, Zeeve, Settlemint, Chainstack are some of the leading Blockchain as a Service
    Providers across the world. Bakong Bakong is the first Central Bank Digital Currency
    (CBDC) launched by The National Bank of Cambodia. This was co-developed by Japanese
    fintech firm SORAMITSU and launched on Oct 28, 2020\. Bakong supports transactions
    in riel and dollars and it has its own mobile app for transactions. Bear Trap A
    bear trap starts with a group of traders selling a large number of cryptos. This
    makes other traders sell since they suspect a price correction. This causes the
    price to fall further. That’s when the bear trap is released when the earlier
    sellers buy back the crypto at a lower price. Bear traps can happen over hours
    or days. Bear Whale A person in Crypto market who places a huge quantity to sell
    at a discount to market price, which pushes market prices to lower levels. This
    event has occurred in Bitcoin in the year 2014 where an individual known as Bearwhale
    lost faith in Bitcoin and transferred 30,000 coins to Bitstamp and placed a sell
    limit order at USD 300 per coin while market price was USD 350\. Besu Hyperledger
    Besu is an Ethereum client designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public
    and private permissioned Blockchain use cases. It can also be operated on test
    networks such as Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Görli. Hyperledger Besu includes several
    consensus algorithms including Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Authority (IBFT,
    IBFT 2.0, Etherhash, and Clique). Its comprehensive permissioning schemes are
    designed specifically for use in a consortium environment. BFT (Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance) BFT is the property of a system that is able to resist the class of
    failures derived from the Byzantine Generals’ Problem. This means that a BFT system
    is able to continue operating even if some of the nodes in Blockchain network
    fail or act maliciously. It is used as one of the consensus mechanisms in Blockchain
    networks to protect Blockchains from manipulation by rogue nodes or unknown actors.
    Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance was introduced by Miguel Castro and Barbara
    Liskov at MIT Laboratory and used by Blockchain protocols – Hyperledger, Stellar
    and Ripple. Binance Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange that provides a platform
    for trading various cryptocurrencies. As of January 2018, Binance was the largest
    cryptocurrency exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. Binance was founded
    by Changpeng Zhao, a developer who had previously created high frequency trading
    software. Binance has also launched two cryptos developed internally – Binance
    Coin (BNB) with a market cap of over USD 50 billion and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
    BNB can be used to pay exchange fees on Binance for various transactions. BIP
    (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) It is a standard for proposing changes to Bitcoin
    protocol. They include consensus related critical changes like soft fork and hard
    fork protocol upgrades, bitcoin software implementations such as modifications
    pertaining to backing up seed formats and peer to peer layer. The first BIP –
    BIP 0001 was proposed by Amir Taaki in the year 2011\. BIP 141 also known as Segragated
    Witness or SegWit has resulted in increasing Block size to address size limitation
    problem that reduced Bitcoin transaction speeds. Bit Bit is a common unit used
    to designate a sub-unit of a bitcoin - 1,000,000 bits is equal to 1 bitcoin (BTC).
    This unit is usually more convenient for pricing tips, goods and services. It
    is also known as Micro bitcoin. However, smallest unit of Bitcoin is Satoshi and
    100 Satoshis make 1 Bit. BITA (Blockchain in Transport Alliance) The Blockchain
    in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is a standards and advocacy organization to help
    educate, advocate, and establish standards for blockchain applications in the
    Transportation industry. It was founded in August 2017\. BITA has nearly 500 members
    from 3PLs / 4PLs, Air Freight, Logistics, Maritime and other service providers
    associated with the transportation industry in over 25 countries, that collectively
    generate over $1 trillion in revenue annually. Bitcoin Its world’s first Decentralized
    Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System introduced by leveraging Blockchain, Distributed
    Ledger Technology. It was first presented to the world through a White Paper titled
    “A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System” by Satoshi Nakamoto in the year 2008\.
    It solved the problem of double counting that was prevalent with currencies issued
    through computers which is not the case with Fiat money (currency issued by Central
    Banks) where Central Bank as intermediary prevents double counting through serial
    numbers on currency notes. Bitcoin was invented to protect small and medium sized
    merchants from fraud and chargebacks pertaining to e-commerce transactions and
    promote peer to peer micro-transactions with low processing fees. It’s a truly
    decentralized network where no single party owns or controls Bitcoin and every
    one can contribute. It’s the first commercial implementation of Blockchain. Bitcoin
    Core It is the software that powers Bitcoin and developed in C++ by Gavin Andresen.
    He took up the role of lead developer after Satoshi Nakamoto stopped corresponding
    in 2010\. Included in the software is a secure digital wallet that can be used
    to store and transact Bitcoins. Bitcoin Core helps to keep Bitcoin decentralized
    and identifies the chain that contains valid transactions. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Bitcoin
    cash is a fork of Bitcoin. It is a spin-off or altcoin and was created on August
    1, 2017 to accommodate larger block sizes so that more transactions can be allowed
    into a single block. It was spun off as the some of the Bitcoin developers didn’t
    agree on increasing the original Bitcoin network capacity. As a result, the Bitcoin
    network became slow and expensive. BCH network now supports up to 32 MB blocks.
    Fork was created at Bitcoin block 478558\. Like Bitcoin, BCH supply is capped
    at 21 million units. BCH offers faster transactions, a network without congestion
    and low transaction fees. Bitcoin Faucet A site run by Gavin Andresen to make
    Bitcoin popular. The visitors to the website had to complete a captcha to earn
    5 Bitcoins. This was done with an intention to ensure that Bitcoin reached a wide
    audience who could make use of it. 19,700 Bitcoins were distributed free of cost
    through this faucet till the time it was closed in the year 2012\. There were
    other free Bitcoin faucets such as FreeBitcoin.in, Cointiply and Faucethub. Bitcoin
    Gold (BTG) BTG is a hard fork of Bitcoin created on October 24, 2017 at block
    height 491407\. BTG is a cryptocurrency with Bitcoin fundamentals, mined on common
    Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) instead of specialty ASICs. ASICs tend to monopolize
    mining to a few big players, but GPU mining means anyone can mine again restoring
    decentralization and independence. Bitcoin.org Bitcoin.org is a community funded
    project. It was originally registered by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi. From
    2011 to 2013 this was used to release new versions of Bitcoin software now called
    Bitcoin core. Today it is an independent open-source project with worldwide contributors.
    It helps people to understand accurate descriptions of Bitcoin properties, potential
    uses and limitations. It also maintains transparency with regards to events that
    impact Bitcoin network and improve its worldwide accessibility. Block Blocks are
    files where blockchain transactions are recorded permanently. Block is like a
    page of a ledger or record book. Each time a block is completed, it gives way
    to the next block in the blockchain. Blocks can also be created based on predefined
    time intervals like one block is created every 10 minutes in Bitcoin. A block
    is thus a permanent store of records which, once written, cannot be altered or
    removed. Current block height in Bitcoin is 676570\. Blocks can be of different
    sizes varying from 1 MB to 8 MB. Block Cipher A block cipher encrypts data in
    specific sized blocks unlike stream ciphers where encryption is bit by bit. Most
    popular block ciphers are Digital Encryption Standard (DES), 3DES and Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES). AES encrypts 128 bit blocks with a key of predetermined
    length: 128, 192, or 256 bits. Block Explorer Block explorer is a blockchain search
    engine that allows anyone to search details about any blockchain transaction.
    A block explorer is an online tool to view all the transactions that have taken
    place on the blockchain, the current network hash rate, transaction growth as
    well as the activity on the blockchain addresses and other useful information.
    Bitcoin Explorer and Etherscan are good examples of Block Explorers for Bitcoin
    and Ethereum respectively. Block Header A block header is used to identify a particular
    block on an entire blockchain and is hashed repeatedly to create proof of work
    for mining rewards. A blockchain consists of a series of various blocks that are
    used to store information related to transactions that occur on a blockchain network.
    Constituents of Block Header are: Timestamp (4 bytes), Version Number (4 bytes),
    Merkle Root (32 bytes), Difficulty Target (4 bytes), Nonce (4 bytes), Previous
    Block Hash (32 bytes). Block Height Block height represents the number of blocks
    that were confirmed in the entire history of a particular blockchain network -
    from the genesis block (or block zero) until the most recent one. Unlike the genesis
    block, all other blocks contain a reference (hash) to the block that preceded
    it, and the block height is the number of each block in that sequence. The block
    height of the genesis block is #0, and the block height of the first block mined
    is #1\. At the time of writing this description, Block Height of Ethereum is 12,657,904\. Block
    Propagation The process of sharing Block with the network after it is mined is
    called Block Propagation. It involves an information sharing process where one
    miner sends the Block to peers who share it with few more until Block reaches
    the entire network. The average time taken for the new block to reach majority
    of nodes in the network is referred to as Block Propagation Time. Block Reward Block
    reward is a cryptocurrency reward to a miner when he/she successfully validates
    the latest block. The block reward is made of two components: the block subsidy
    and the transaction fees. The block subsidy consists of newly generated coins
    and represents the biggest part of a block reward. The other part is made up of
    all fees paid by the transactions that are included in the block. In Bitcoin,
    the Block reward currently is 6.25 BTC for every valid block mined. However, this
    changes and gets half of the reward amount, every 4 years or every 210,000 blocks
    are mined Block timestamp Every block contains a timestamp based on Unix time.
    The timestamp helps in tracking variations in block hashes and makes Blockchain
    manipulation difficult for bad actors. Each timestamp also includes the previous
    timestamp in its hash thereby forming a chain and reinforcing the earlier ones. Blockchain Blockchain
    is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions
    and tracking assets in a business network. By facilitating secured track, trace
    and trade of virtually anything of value in a trusted manner between parties,
    hitherto unknown to each other inside a network, Blockchain Technology vastly
    reduces risk and also cuts costs for all involved. It is a system of recording
    information in a manner that makes hacking or cheating the information difficult.
    It is essentially a record of transactions contained in a ledger maintained in
    Blocks that are replicated or distributed across the entire network. Thus changes
    are committed on the ledger only after consent for such changes is obtained by
    every participant in the network. The records in a Blockchain are therefore, tamper
    evident. Blockchain is also known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Public,
    Private and Hybrid (Consortium) are different types of Blockchains. Bitcoin, Ethereum
    and Litecoin are Public Blockchains, Hyperledger and Corda are Private Blockchains
    and Enterprise Etherium Alliance and TradeLens are Hybrid Blockchains Blocktime It
    is the time taken to create the next block in Blockchain. It is 10 minutes in
    the case of Bitcoin. Blocktime varies from one Blockchain protocol to another.
    In Ethereum, average Blocktime is 13.30 seconds and has been rising over the years. Bootnode Bootnode
    is used for Blockchain installation, running configurations, and managing updates.
    It is also used as a regular node to scale other nodes or discover them. It helps
    in discovering peers. Bounty A marketing strategy used in case of Initial Coin
    Offerings (ICOs) where incentives are offered to participants for various activities
    associated with ICOs especially in promoting them. After ICO completion, Bounty
    program can be used to obtain feedback on project code from external developers
    or as a reward to promote ICO or project in media channels. BTC The short code
    used to refer Bitcoin. BTC Escrow An intermediary between the participants in
    Bitcoin or crypto transactions. When a person decides to buy some goods or services
    by paying in Bitcoins, he / she sends those Bitcoins to an escrow service and
    it is kept in the system till the goods or services are provided by the seller.
    Once the transaction is completed, Bitcoins stored in escrow system are automatically
    sent to the seller. BTD (Buy the Dip) Slang used by cryptocurrency traders to
    indicate buying a particular cryptocurrency when its price dips or is on decline. Bug
    Bounty It’s an initiative through which individuals who identify and report bugs
    in a program, code and application are rewarded. It helps in finding vulnerabilities
    before they become security issues. Intel, Facebook, Cisco, Apple, Dropbox and
    others have been running such programs successfully. Payments range from a few
    hundred dollars to thousands of dollars. Binance, one of the world’s leading Cryptocurrency
    exchanges offers USD 200 to USD 10,000 per vulnerability identified and maximum
    reward is USD 100,000\. Burrow Hyperledger Burrow is a permissioned Ethereum smart
    contract Blockchain node focused on simplicity, speed, and developer ergonomics.
    It supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Web Assembly (WASM) based
    smart contracts and uses Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus via the Tendermint
    algorithm. Features include Proof of Stake support, On Chain Governance, Javascript
    client library and many others. Bitcoin Pizza Day May 22 is known as Bitcoin Pizza
    Day when in 2010 developer Laszlo Hanyecz from Florida, US bought two pizzas from
    Papa Johns with bitcoins and offered 10,000 BTC, equivalent to about USD 30 at
    the time. Value of this transaction is worth USD 580 million today considering
    the current price of Bitcoins.CHAPTER 3 C CA (Central Authority) A Central Authority
    in any system in an organisation, an agency or a set of persons, designated to
    play a key facilitating role in the implementation and operation of the system.
    Central Authority takes the responsibility of undertaking activities that are
    designed to protect the members and users of the system. Government and Regulatory
    agencies, IT administrators, and Central Banks are some of the examples of a ‘Central
    Authority’ acting as a fulcrum around which large operations are undertaken. CA
    in Blockchain (Certification Authority) In Blockchain systems, the Central Authority’s
    server guarantees the uniqueness of the addresses of participating entities by
    issuing them certificates recognized in the respective systems. It employs Certificate
    Authority to achieve this purpose. In cryptography, a Certificate Authority or
    Certification Authority is an entity that issues digital certificates. These certificates
    certify the ownership of a public key by the named subject mentioned in the certificate.
    In addition to user enrollment, CA also manages transactions invoked on Blockchain
    and Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections between various users in Blockchain. CAP
    Theorem Consistency (Uniform & identical view of data for all clients), Availability
    (Continuous performance and uptime in presence of node failures) and Partition
    tolerance (Accurate performance and integrity of data despite node partitioning)
    are some of the key features of distributed systems. As per CAP theorem, any distributed
    system/database can offer only 2 of the above 3 mentioned properties choosing
    to offer C&A, A&P or P&C at any point in time. For example, Permissionless Blockchains
    such as Bitcoin, Ethereum chose to offer Availability and Partition tolerance
    while sacrificing immediate Consistency, thus offering ‘eventual consistency’
    of data stored. Cardano Cardano is a cryptocurrency network and open-source project
    that aims to run a public blockchain platform for smart contracts. Cardano’s internal
    cryptocurrency is called Ada. The development of the project is overseen and supervised
    by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland. It was launched in 2017 by
    Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum and BitShares. Calibra Calibra is
    the blockchain division of Facebook. It will allow Facebook to enable digital
    payment to its users. Calibra team is building a digital wallet for Facebook’s
    apps, which will eventually hold the Diem (formerly Libra) digital currency, but
    Facebook won’t control the coin. Its not clear whether Facebook is actively pursuing
    this project. Caliper Hyperledger Caliper is a Blockchain tool hosted by Linux
    Foundation. It lets you compute performance of specific Blockchain implementations
    by leveraging a set of predefined use cases. Caliper can also generate reports
    on different performance factors, including resource utilization, transaction
    latency, and transactions per second (TPS). Casper The Casper Network is the first
    live proof-of-stake blockchain built based on the Casper CBC specification. Casper
    is designed to accelerate enterprise and developer adoption of blockchain technology
    today and evolve to meet user needs in the future. It fosters core Web3 principles
    that allow anyone to participate on Blockchain through various apps without monetizing
    their personal data. CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) CBDC is a new type of
    currency that central banks of many countries are experimenting with. This can
    be a digital form of current fiat currency in Blockchain. This is different from
    cryptocurrency because it is controlled by the central government. It will be
    a stable coin whose value will be linked to national currency of the issuing Country
    / issuing Central Bank. It can be either Wholesale CBDC that is exchanged and
    traded only between Central Banks and Private Banks or Retail CBDC that is meant
    for ordinary consumers and citizens; people who will use it for their daily purchases
    or activities. CBDCs are being promoted with the intent to accomplish Financial
    Inclusion, Combat Crime, Prevent Illicit activities andReduce the cost of distributing
    money in economy. China, Cambodia, Sweden, The Bahamas and Switzerland are actively
    piloting and testing CBDCs. CDN (Content Delivery Network) A CDN (Content Delivery
    Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays
    in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server
    and the user. This helps users around the world view the same high-quality content
    without slow webpages or app pages loading times. Cloudflare, Fastly, Microsoft
    Azure CDN and Google Cloud CDN are some of the leading CDN providers. CeFi (Centralized
    Finance) CeFi in Blockchain refers to the participation of intermediaries to facilitate
    crypto-asset exchange transactions between the respective holders. They act on
    behalf of the owners of the cryptocurrencies or the tokens by facilitating a number
    of different types of transactions. However, this induces a risk of malpractices
    by these intermediaries or hacks of holders systems leading to loss, thus acting
    like a Single Point of Failure. An alternative to this is the DeFi or Decentralized
    Finance that is facilitated by Decentralized exchanges, that eliminate the need
    of intermediaries, hence corresponding risks associated with them are also eliminated.
    However, Decentralized exchanges cannot offer a number of benefits offered by
    the Centralized exchanges like fiat conversion and Cross chain exchanges. Cello Cello
    is a Blockchain module toolkit from The Linux Foundation. It is essentially an
    on-demand “as-a-service” deployment model developed for the Blockchain ecosystem.
    Cello provides a multi-tenant chain service that can work on top of multiple infrastructures,
    including container platforms and virtual machines. In essence, it reduces the
    effort required for creating, managing and using Blockchains. CEX (Centralized
    Exchange) Centralized exchanges are third-party trading platforms that function
    like traditional brokerage or stock markets, acting on behalf of their users for
    trading crypto-currencies and assets. CEXs maintain customers’ or end users’ crypto
    funds, balances and possess custody of their private keys. Some centralized exchanges
    have shut down owing to death of their promoters or promoters fleeing resulting
    in loss of users’ crypto assets. Kraken, Gemini and Robinhood are some well-known
    Centralized Exchanges. Chain Code Chaincode is a piece of code that is written
    in one of the supported languages such as Go or Java and runs on top of the Blockchain.
    It contains business logic pertaining to applications interaction with the ledger
    and runs in a secured Docker container isolated from peers that endorse transactions.
    For eg: It is installed and instantiated through a Software Development Kit (SDK)
    or Command Line Interface (CLI) onto a network of Hyperledger Fabric peer nodes,
    enabling interaction with that network’s shared ledger. Chain Link Chainlink is
    a decentralized network of nodes that provide data and information from off-blockchain
    sources to on-blockchain smart contracts via oracles. The Chainlink aggregating
    contract collates all data from chosen oracles and validates and/or reconciles
    it, for accurate representation. Crop insurance on Blockchain is a proven use
    case of using Chain Link for decentralized oracle nodes that source weather data
    from multiple sources to self-execute claims through smart contracts. Channels In
    Hyperledger Fabric, there can be multiple ledgers and each ledger is referred
    to as a Channel. They help to promote Data Privacy by enabling private communications
    between various network members. They can be dynamically created and reconfigured.
    Parties transacting in a Channel should be authenticated to that particular Channel
    to ensure that external parties don’t gain access to the communication. For eg:
    In a Supply Chain Blockchain, there will be a channel between the Customer and
    Supplier A and a separate Channel between Customer and Supplier B. This ensures
    that suppliers A and B transact privately and separately with the same Customer
    and don’t have access to each other’s channel. Checksum A checksum is generally
    designed to detect accidental errors in small blocks of data. It allows the user
    to check if piece of data or information is the same as expected. For eg: In Bitcoin,
    addresses include checksum so they can be checked to see if they have been typed
    correctly. This allows users to avoid sending Bitcoin to poorly formed addresses.
    They are created by hashing data through SHA 256 algorithm twice, the first 4
    bytes of the result is taken as Checksum. 1 byte will be equal to two characters. CIA
    Triad CIA triad stands for Confidentiality, Information Security and Availability,
    the three fundamental tenets that stand as the goal of any system designed to
    perform in a secure manner. Blockchain implementation is deemed to enhance the
    resilience of the underlying systems and implementation based on CIA triad tenets.
    This triad has been formed over the years and doesn’t belong to a single creator. Cipher Cipher
    is an encryption algorithm which is applied to a plain text to convert it into
    ciphertext which is the unreadable output of an encryption algorithm.. They are
    also used to decrypt cipher text into plain text. Keys are used to accomplish
    this conversion. There are 7 different types of ciphers – Caesar, Monoalphabetic,
    Homophonic Substitution, Polygram Substitution, Polyalphabetic Substitution, Playfair
    & Hill. Cipher Text Cipher text is the encrypted output of a plain text, which
    is the result of Cipher algorithmic operation. Cipher text can reveal the actual
    plain text that it represents when it is passed through the corresponding decryption
    algorithm. Clique Clique is a cross-client proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus
    protocol. It shadows the design of Ethereum mainnet, so it can be added to any
    client with minimal effort. In a PoA, the minted blocks are deemed to be signed
    by Trusted signers and thus, is a much simpler and energy efficient alternative
    to the Proof of Work consensus mechanism. Hyperledger Besu uses Clique consensus
    protocol. Coinbase A Coinbase transaction is the first transaction in a block,
    created and used by miners. It is used to collect the block reward for their work.
    Any other transaction fees collected by the miner is also sent in this transaction. Coinbase
    Exchange Founded in 2012, it is a fully regulated and licensed cryptocurrency
    exchange. It initially allowed only Bitcoin for trading and started adding other
    cryptos that confirmed to its decentralized criteria. It supports over 50 million
    users in 100 countries catering to USD 200+ Bn worth of assets. Coin Desk CoinDesk
    is a news site specializing in bitcoin and digital currencies launched in May
    2013\. The site was founded by Shakil Khan who is also an investor in Bitpay a
    Bitcoin payment processor and was subsequently acquired by Digital Currency Group. Cold
    Wallet The cold wallet is an offline wallet carried on a hardware device or printed
    on a paper that stores the user’s address and private key and works in conjunction
    with compatible software in the computer. Since Cold Wallets are not connected
    to the internet, they are deemed much more secure than ‘Hot wallets’ that function
    on internet connected devices or portals. Ledger Nano, Trezor and KeepKey are
    the most popular Cold wallets. Collusion Collusion is an often-deceitful agreement
    or secret cooperation between two or more parties to work together and distort
    the market forces by limiting free and fair competition. Colluding as opposed
    to collaboration can cause unhealthy and fraudulent practices in the marketplace,
    thus disturbing the market equilibrium. In Cryptography, Collusion problem determines
    whether set of users through collusion can extract information that is designed
    to be hidden from them after a protocol is executed. Compiler In computing, a
    compiler is a computer program that translates source code from a high-level programming
    language, also known as source language, to a lower level language to create an
    executable program that is understood by the target computing machine. In Ethereum,
    Solidity acts as a Compiler. In Hyperledger, Fabric Compiler can publish code
    to a Fabric Store, making it available for download and use. Confidential Computing Confidential
    computing is an advanced cybersecurity paradigm that is used to encrypt and protect
    the data in use, while being processed, thus creating a highly secure computing
    environment. It enables encrypted data to be processed in memory and lowers the
    risk of exposure to rest of the system. It is achieved through a hardware enabled
    process that creates a trusted execution environment, isolating the protected
    data or applications from the operating system. Intel has rolled out a service
    called Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) that helps to keep sensitive data
    isolated from other privileged portions especially in multi-tenant cloud environments.
    Linux Foundation is promoting Confidential Computing Consortiums. R3 has launched
    a Confidential Computing platform called Conclave. Conclave A standalone platform
    launched by R3 leveraging Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) to address
    business scenarios where data needs to be shared in a consortium of firms where
    one person or firm should not be able to see others information It helps in establishing
    trusted services that can detect fraud and reduce cost where owners of data can
    control how it is shared and processed. Confirmation Confirmation in Blockchain
    implies that a transaction has been processed by the network by clearing the consensus
    process that has been programmed in the system and thus is eligible to be added
    to the ledger being carried by the corresponding nodes, which are a party to the
    transaction. Once confirmed, the transactions are considered almost irreversible
    and tamper evident. Using Blockcypher or Blockchain.com explorers one can see
    numbers of confirmations that the transaction has obtained by pasting the transaction
    ID into the search field of respective explorers. In Bitcoin by design, a transaction
    will receive atleast 1 confirmation after an average of 10 minutes. Consensus
    Mechanisms The mechanism by which members come to an agreement about the authenticity
    of a transaction is referred to as the ‘Consensus Mechanism.’ Consensus formation
    ensures the involvement of multiple validators in a systematic and predetermined
    manner, ensuring decentralization and objectivity of decision making. It ensures
    implementation of the key features of the Blockchain platform like increased trust,
    immutability of the transactions, and maintenance of integrity of the platform.
    It is the soul of the Blockchain platform and will help help members in reaching
    right decisions at all times. Sanctity of Blockchain applications depends on the
    strength and reliability of consensus mechanism used by it. Bitcoin and the earlier
    version of the public Ethereum client follows ‘Proof-of-Work (POW)’ Consensus
    mechanisms where miners or validators compete with each other and burn valuable
    resources like computing power and enormous amounts of electricity to guess the
    right Nonce (number used only once) and create a targeted hash to win the race
    to create a block. Ethereum platform will soon shift to a ‘Proof of Stake’ (POS)
    based consensus, which involves negligible energy consumption. Some new-generation
    public platforms use variations of ‘POW’ and ‘POS’-based consensus algorithms
    like PoET (Proof of Elapsed Time) and DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) to minimize
    resource utilization and wastage. Enterprise Blockchains like Hyperledger and
    others use energy-efficient algorithms like ‘Proof of Authority’ (POA), Practical
    Byzantine Fault-Tolerant’ (PBFT), ‘Node to Node’ (N2N) and their variations to
    arrive at a deterministic consensus. Consensus mechanisms aim is to ensure that
    all participants have identical copies of distributed database files. ConsenSys ConsenSys
    is Ethereum focused software company founded by Joseph Lubin in 2014\. It offers
    next-generation applications and a modern financial infrastructure to access the
    decentralized web. Their product suite composed of Infura, Quorum, Truffle, Codefi,
    MetaMask, and Diligence, serves millions of users, supports billions of blockchain-based
    queries for the Ethereum ecosystem participants across the world and handles billions
    of dollars in digital assets. Consortium A consortium is an association of two
    or more individuals, companies, organizations or governments with the objective
    of participating in a common activity or pooling their resources for achieving
    a common goal. A Blockchain consortium is formed by a group of players in the
    ecosystem with a common goal of leveraging the technology for the common benefit
    of the ecosystem, by creating an elevated level of trust in the business environment,
    reduces costs, improves productivity and delights customers. For a thorough understanding
    of this topic, one may refer, the book, BLOCKCHAIN CONSORTIUMS – A Comprehensive
    Handbook: Analyzing the Business Model of the Future authored by Srinivas Mahankali
    (Co-author of this Book) & Varun Singhi, Murthy Chitlur (reviewers of this book) Container Container
    technology was born in 1979 with Unix Version 7 and the Chroot system. It picked
    up steam in early 2000s with Linux VServer and introduction of Docker that led
    to a massive adoption of this technology. Further momentum came through introduction
    of Kubernetes – a container orchestration technology in 2017\. A container is
    a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so
    the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
    A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software
    that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools,
    system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime in
    the case of Docker containers when they are run on Docker Engines. Available for
    both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always
    run the same, regardless of underlying infrastructure. Containers isolate software
    from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for
    instance between development and staging. Contract A contract is a legally binding
    agreement, enforceable by law, often documented in writing, between at least two
    parties that defines and governs the rights and duties of the parties to an agreement.
    In the Blockchain ecosystem, contracts are encoded in the form of applications
    triggered on an immutable & tamper evident ledger. These applications are termed
    as smart-contracts, chaincode, flows etc., and need to be supplemented by legally
    binding proofs like notarization by court-approved entities to ensure enforceability. Corda Corda
    is an open-source project, promoted by R3 an enterprise software firm, based on
    distributed ledger technology, designed for businesses to interact with each other
    in a trusted environment. Its intent is to deliver next generation Blockchain
    platform that addresses privacy, scalability and security to become DLT platform
    of choice for Financial Services and other verticals. Corda’s smart contract technology
    allows interoperable business networks that transact value directly with each
    other in strict privacy. Instead of approving in batches & confirming transactions
    in blocks, Corda confirms & commits each transaction in real-time. More than 350
    institutions have deployed Corda. Cosmos Cosmos is a decentralized network of
    independent parallel blockchains, each powered by Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
    consensus algorithms like Tendermint consensus, allowing the Blockchains in its
    ecosystem to scale and interoperate with each other. Cosmos has two types of blockchains:
    Zones and Hubs. Zones are regular Blockchains, while Hubs are Blockchains that
    connect zones with one another. The Cosmos Hub, is a public, Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
    Blockchain whose native asset or cryptocurrency is Atom. More than 210 Atoms are
    in circulation. CRISP-DM Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
    refers to the standards used by Data mining experts while dealing with data across
    organisations, systems and platforms. Blockchain is an inter-enterprise platform
    and the data is recorded in Blockchain ledgers. As this data is deemed to be a
    high quality input for Data Analysis, it is important to strictly adhere to the
    CRISP-DM, an open standard process that incorporates many open standard processes. Crypto-anarchy Crypto-anarchism
    (or crypto-anarchy) is a political ideology that believes in attaining privacy,
    political freedom and economic freedom with the help of cryptographic software
    that achieves confidentiality and security while sending and receiving information
    over computer networks. In 1988, Timothy C May wrote ‘Crypto Anarchist Manifesto
    which specified basic principles such as encrypted exchanges ensuring total anonymity,
    freedom of speech and freedom to trade. Bitcoin whose invention has been influenced
    by this Manifesto, and world’s first commercial implementation of Blockchain Technology
    is considered as a symbol of Crypto-anarchy by eliminating the need of regulators
    and central authorities for conducting financial transactions. With El Salvador
    becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, role of Bitcoin in
    legitimate and Government backed financial transactions will increase and may
    bring to fruition the goals and dreams of Crypto-anarchists. Cryptography Cryptography,
    or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication
    by obscuring adversaries and malicious hackers. It is the process of converting
    ordinary/plain text to an un-intelligible format by using algorithms, in such
    a way that only the intended parties can understand the same by applying corresponding
    decryption method. It is believed that Cryptography was used for correspondence
    by Spartans as early as 400 BC where they used a cipher device called Scytale
    for secret communication between various military commanders. Cryptography history
    can be classified into three phases. Phase 1 – Upto World War 1 where ciphers
    were limited to few pages or few manual devices. After World War 1, mechanization
    of ciphers and cryptography began using telephone and telegraph devices resulting
    in Phase 2\. There was also switch from electro-mechanical devices to electronics
    during this phase with the advent of Data Encryption Standards (DES) and Advanced
    Encryption Standards (AES). Phase 3 has commenced in the last two decades of Century
    with appearance of digital signatures and hashing algorithms. Cryptojacking Cryptojacking
    is malicious crypto mining that happens when cybercriminals hack into both business
    and personal computers, laptops, and mobile devices to install malware. This software
    uses the computer’s power and resources to mine for cryptocurrencies or steal
    cryptocurrency wallets owned by unsuspecting victims. Cryptojacking malware affects
    almost 55% of businesses the world over using as much as 65% of CPU power. Coinhive
    and MassMiner are some of the dangerous Cryptojacking malwares. Cypherpunks Cypherpunks
    are those who supported the Cryptoanarchy concept proposed by Timothy May. The
    group was founded by Timothy May, John Gilmore and Eric Hughes. Cypherpunks mailing
    list was started in 1992 covering subjects like computer science, cryptography,
    political discussions etc. Cypherpunks advocated widespread use of strong cryptography
    and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change.CHAPTER
    4 D Daemon Daemon is a process operating in the background waiting for a specific
    event or condition in order to be activated. In Blockchain world, Daemons distribute
    Blocks & Transactions, create new blocks, validate blocks and transactions and
    also resolve forks as and when they occur. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) It is
    a directed graph data structure that uses a topological ordering. The sequence
    can only go from first to last. DAG is often applied to problems related to data
    processing, scheduling, finding the best route in navigation, and data compression.
    DAG technology is often placed together with Blockchain however it is considered
    to be another form of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). It consists of network
    of individual transactions linked to multiple other transactions. There are no
    blocks and chain of previously validated Blocks in DAG. Dai (or DAI) DAI is a
    stable coin cryptocurrency which aims to keep its value as close to one United
    States dollar (USD) as possible through an automated system of smart contracts
    on Ethereum blockchain. On December 18, 2017, Dai and its associated smart contracts
    were officially launched on the main Ethereum network. It is maintained and regulated
    by MakerDAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization consisting of owners of MKR
    which is its governance token. Users will be able to borrow against the deposits
    of their Ether and receive newly generated DAI in ratio of 1.5:1 i.e. 1 DAI for
    every 1.5 Ether deposited. As a result, DAI is considered as a good adoption of
    Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Once the loan and its interest is repaid, the returned
    DAI is automatically destroyed and collateral is allowed for withdrawal. DAML
    (Digital Assets Modelling Language) DAML is developed by Digital Asset, a company
    co-founded and led by Yuval Rooz. It is used to build digital assets such as smart
    contracts for blockchains. This technology complements Digital Asset’s existing
    technology by providing a new, verifiable way for parties involved in a transaction
    to provide updates to a distributed ledger while preserving data confidentiality.
    It is a new Haskell-inspired functional programming language that has been under
    development for a few years, and with latest developments in the fast-changing
    blockchain environment, DAML has become the most popular programming language
    for building smart contracts. It offers DAML Connect (complete development and
    application stack), DAML Drivers (allows application deployment using Distributed
    Ledgers, Blockchains or Databases) and DAML Hub (a Cloud service that enables
    rapid distributed application development) DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) DAO
    was an organization that was designed to be automated and decentralized. It acts
    as a form of venture capital fund, based on open-source code and without a typical
    management structure or board of directors. To be fully decentralized, the DAO
    was unaffiliated with any particular nation-state, though it made use of Ethereum
    network. It had crowd sourced $150 million in cryptocurrency, started in April
    2016 and became defunct in September 2016\. A vulnerability in The DAO code was
    exploited by users to siphon off of The DAO’s funds to a subsidiary. As a result,
    Ethereum community hard forked the Ethereum Blockchain to restore all funds to
    the original contract. The original unforked Blockchain is known as Ethereum Classic
    and the forked one is known as Ethereum. DAPPS (Decentralized applications) Decentralized
    applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on
    Blockchain or P2P network of computers instead of a single computer, and are outside
    the purview and control of a single authority. Chainlink, Brave, EOS Dynasty,
    Maker DAO and Chainyard are some of the well-known dApps. DDoS Attacks (Distributed
    Denial of Service attacks) Distributed Network Attacks are often referred to as
    Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This type of attack takes advantage
    of the specific capacity limits that apply to any network resources – such as
    the infrastructure that enables a company’s website. The DDoS attack will send
    multiple requests to the attacked web resource – with the aim of exceeding the
    website’s capacity to handle multiple requests and prevent the website from functioning
    correctly. To preempt DDoS attacks crippling network infrastructure particulary
    those that are architected on centralized infrastructure principles, decentralized
    infrastructures based on Distributed Ledger Technology are being considered to
    prevent single point of failure. DES (Digital Encryption Standard) The Data Encryption
    Standard is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Developed
    in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the
    algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the
    agency’s invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified
    electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security
    Agency (NSA), the NBS selected a slightly modified version which was published
    as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States
    in 1977\. The original DES’ key size of 56 bits was sufficient when it was developed.
    To prevent successful brute forces attacks on DES owing to increasing computational
    power, Triple DES (TDES) came into existence which applies DES algorithm three
    times to each data block. In May 2002, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) replaced
    DES. De-Fi (Decentralized finance) Decentralized finance (commonly referred to
    as DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial
    intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks to offer traditional financial
    instruments, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common
    being Ethereum. Maker, Uniswap and Compound are some of the leading DeFi services
    providers. Decentralisation In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer
    of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization,
    or group thereof) to a distributed network. It facilitates Digitization of Trust
    where trust is contained in a distributed network rather than in a centralized
    party or entity. It provides trustless environment, promotes data reconciliation,
    minimizes points of failures and maximizes resource distribution. Delegated Proof
    of Stake (DPoS) Its similar to Proof of Stake since the validators of blocks in
    Blockchain are required to invest or stake cryptocurrencies on transactions to
    be validated. These validators are selected via voting by various token holders
    where votes are proportional to their stakes. Degen Refers to cryptocurrency projects
    that are involved in pumping and dumping schemes. Usually, worthless and junk
    tokens are hyped up in various communications channels and forums and they are
    abandoned later through Degens. Tendies, YFI and Yam have been considered as Degen
    projects. DevOps DevOps, a term coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois, is a complementary
    set of practices to Agile software development where development and operations
    teams remained separated and siloed. It aims to shorten the systems development
    life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality by bringing
    these two teams together right from starting of the project. This replaced the
    Waterfall Software development model. DEX (Decentralized exchange) Crypto funds
    and balances are maintained by the users. DEX doesn’t have any custody. It promotes
    transactions between two parties using software tools, open blockchains, and internet.
    DEX is autonomous and run by algorithms and smart contracts. There are more than
    35 DEXs like Dydx, Uniswap, Bancor, Changelly and BisQ. Diamond Hands It represents
    cryptocurrency traders or investors who keep holding onto their respective cryptocurrencies
    even when their price or value drops. They believe that such price drop is only
    temporary and will be corrected eventually. DIDs (Digital Identifiers Documents) DIDs
    are a type of identifiers that enable a verifiable, decentralized digital identity.
    They are based on the Self-Sovereign Identity paradigm. A DID identifies any subject
    e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc. They obviate
    the need for a central administrative system to manage and control the identifiers
    and use cryptographic basis to provide Decentralized identification. DIDs are
    being promoted by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to develop next generation Web. DIEM Diem
    is a permissioned blockchain-based payment system proposed by Facebook, Inc. The
    plan includes a private stablecoin implemented as a cryptocurrency, with 1 Diem
    pegged at 1 USD and was formerly known as Libra. This yet to come to existence. Difficulty Difficulty
    is a number that regulates how long it takes for miners to add new blocks to the
    blockchain. In Bitcoin, it determines the difficulty level to mine a Block which
    is basically finding a hash below a particular target. High difficulty will result
    in more compute power to mine the blocks. Difficulty is adjusted after every 2016
    blocks are mined, based on the time taken to find preceding 2016 blocks. In Bitcoin,
    a new block is created every 10 minutes, hence 2016 blocks will take exactly two
    weeks to be mined. Difficulty will be reduced if the previous 2016 blocks took
    more than two weeks to be found or mined and vice versa. Digi Cash Founded by
    electronic currency pioneer David Chaum in 1989, DigiCash was one of the earliest
    electronic money companies. Digicash used cryptographic protocols to make the
    transactions anonymous. This was accomplished through Blind Signature Technology
    developed leveraging advancements in Public and Private Key technologies. As a
    result Bank or Government would be unable to trace personal payments conducted
    online. No wonder, David Chaum was one of the prominent and leading Cypherpunks. Digital
    Assets The definition of a digital asset is “anything that exists in binary data
    which is self-contained, uniquely identifiable, and has a value or ability to
    use.” When the term originated in the mid-90s, digital assets were items such
    as videos, images, audio, and documentation. In today’s world, it is widely used
    to refer to cryptocurrencies that are decentralized and run on a network that
    is distributed across a large number of computers. Digital Signature It validates
    the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document using
    mathematical techniques. It solves the problem of tampering or impersonation in
    digital communications by using Asymmetric cryptography such as RSA based on public
    key cryptography. Digital Signatures use security features and methods such as
    Checksum, Certificate Authority (CA) validation, Trust Service Provider (TSP)
    Validation. Disintermediation Disintermediation is the process of removing the
    middleman or intermediary from future transactions. DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
    is a good example of disintermediation as it doesn’t rely on central financial
    intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges or banks and utilizes smart contracts
    to create required trust between two unknown parties. Distributed Ledger A distributed
    ledger is a shared database containing digital data that is synchronized at regular
    intervals even though it is geographically spread across multiple sites, countries,
    or institutions. It doesn’t have a central administrator and allows for public
    witnesses or consent. They can be either Permissioned or Permissionless ledgers. DLT
    (Distributed Ledger Technology) It’s the technology that powers Blockchains. Though
    it was first outlined in 1991 by Staurt Haber and W Scott Stornetta, it was first
    conceptualized by a person or group of people known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008\.
    It allows for storage of all information in a secure and accurate manner using
    cryptography in a decentralized database. Once the information is stored it becomes
    immutable database. It is anticipated that 10% of world’s GDP will be processed
    through DLT by the year 2027\. Docker Invented by Solomon Hykes in 2013\. Its
    a tool designed to create, deploy and run applications using containers. Containers
    package applications with all parts it needs such as libraries and deploy it as
    one package. It brings security to applications running in shared environment. Dogecoin It
    is a peer to peer cryptocurrency predominantly used as a tipping system, in which
    social media users tip others for providing interesting or noteworthy content.
    It was created by referencing the face of the Shiba Inu dog from “Doge” meme as
    its logo and namesake on December 6, 2013, by software engineers Billy Markus
    and Jackson Palmer. It started as a satire on the growth of various altcoins.
    It has 1-minute block interval which means its faster than other Blockchains Double
    Counting Double counting in accounting is an error whereby a transaction is counted
    more than once, for whatever reason. Double Spending Double-spending is a unique
    problem associated with digital currencies, that allows for an online value unit
    to be spent more than once. This is because the digital information surrounding
    the value unit can be reproduced relatively easily by tech savvy individuals in
    absence of a central authority that keeps tab of each and every transaction between
    parties. Bitcoin, the first commercial application of Blockchain technology, solved
    this problem by preventing Double-spending on digital value units that are created
    online, through a unique cryptographically executed process and recording transactions
    in a distributed ledger needing consensus from all parties before they are finalized
    and approved. Hence it is called a Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin employs a universal
    ledger, termed blockchain and provides a way for all nodes to be aware of every
    transaction confirmed through a game theory inspired process and broadcasted to
    all the nodes in the form of blocks. Digital Twin A digital twin is a virtual
    representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical
    object or process. The concept of digital twin is widely used to monitor physical
    assets such as turbines, engines, and telecommunication towers within the boundaries
    of the enterprise. A blockchain based Digital Twin is applicable when the asset
    in consideration is shared or transacts with multiple stakeholders in its lifecycle
    using a distributed and immutable ledger serving as Single Source of Truth. IOT
    based products and industrial assets are good contenders for the application of
    Digital Twin concept using Blockchain.CHAPTER 5 E EEA (Ethereum Enterprise Alliance) The
    Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) is a member-led industry organization whose
    objective is to drive the use of Ethereum blockchain technology as an open-standard
    to empower enterprises. It was launched in February 2017\. The EEA’s mission is
    to deliver an open, standards-based architecture and specification to accelerate
    the adoption of Enterprise Ethereum. Its members include several organizations
    across the globe. Founding members and rotating board include Accenture, Banco
    Santander, BlockApps, BNY Mellon, CME Group, ConsenSys, IC3, Intel, JP Morgan,
    Microsoft and Nuco. EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) EIP is an acronym for
    Ethereum Improvement Proposal, just as BIP is an acronym for Bitcoin Investment
    Proposal. The EIPs set out the technical standards (protocol specifications, contract
    standards, client APIs etc.) for Ethereum blockchain. Martin Becze, Vitalik Buterin
    andGavin Wood were the original EIP editors from 2015 to end of 2016\. ECC (Elliptic
    Curve Cryptography) It is Public Key cryptography based on elliptic curves over
    finite fields and their algebraic structure. They are able to provide same cryptographic
    strength as RSA encryption but with much smaller key sizes. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve
    Digital Signature Algorithm) ECDSA is a digital signature algorithm that makes
    use of ECC to create the key pairs used in the signing and verification process
    of digital signatures. Because of its advantages compared to other public-key
    algorithms, it is commonly used in blockchain applications to sign transactions
    or events. Encryption Encryption is the process of securing information through
    cryptography. Plain text is converted into an alternative form known as Ciphertext.
    Only parties possessing the keys will be able to convert ciphertext back into
    plain text for decrypting and reading the information. AES, Triple DES, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman),
    Blowfish and ECC are some of the leading encryption technologies. Enterprise Blockchain It’s
    a Blockchain network usually implemented by corporates or companies to manage
    their business processes like corporate finance, treasury, trade finance, insurance,
    supply chain, contracts management, international money remittances and global
    payments. Enterprise Blockchains are permissioned blockchains in nature where
    partners, peers or suppliers who intend to join the Blockchain, need prior approval
    from the company that has hosted or commissioned the Blockchain. The company hosting
    the Blockchain doesn’t control the Blockchain as all parties once they are admitted
    have equal rights and control of the network. R3, Ethereum Enterprise Alliance,
    Hyperledger Foundation are some famous organizations who are working on development
    of Enterprise Blockchain. EOA (Externally Owned Accounts) Externally Owned Accounts
    are controlled by private keys. A person possessing the private key of the account
    will be able to send cryptos (Ether in case of Ethereum) and messages from the
    account. It doesn’t have any associated code unlike the Contract Accounts (CA)
    that are controlled by code. Transaction Validation involves checking the timestamp
    and nonce combination to establish validity, and the availability of sufficient
    fees for execution. EOS Blockchain Entrepreneurial Operating System, (EOS) is
    a blockchain-based decentralized operating system that is designed to create,
    host and support secure, decentralized autonomous applications (dApps) and smart
    contracts. It was designed to meet large scale decentralized applications and
    developed by Daniel Larimer and Brendan Blumer. It was released as open source
    software by the company Block.one which distributed one billion tokens based on
    its native currency EOS. EPOCH An epoch is the target time period for which a
    given group of Miners is elected to serve as the consensus group. It also defines
    period of time taken for pre-specified number of blocks to be confirmed on the
    chain. In Ethereum Blockchain for every 30,000 blocks, a new piece of data (a
    DAG) is used for mining new blocks. Each new group of 30,000 blocks is known as
    an epoch. ERC 20 (Ethereum Request for Comments - 20) ERC 20 is defined as the
    standard protocol for issuing tokens on the Ethereum network. According to the
    official sources, the protocol governs the tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
    The suffix “20” is used for the sole purpose of representing the unique proposal
    ID. Developers use the ERC20 token to develop their project. It is a way to tokenize
    their project and at the same time offers them a way to raise funds for their
    respective projects. ERC 20 defines six different functions for benefit of other
    tokens within the Ethereum system and has led to the birth of several alternate
    tokens (Alt Tokens) or Alternate Coins. ERC 721 (Ethereum Request for Comments
    721) ERC 721 tokens, more commonly referred to as Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs) allow
    developers to tokenize ownership of any arbitrary data, digital assets or digital
    collectibles there by increasing the design space of what can be represented as
    a token on the Ethereum blockchain. They were proposed by William Entriken, Dieter
    Shirley, Jacob Evans and Nastassia Sachs in January 2018\. Escrow Escrow is a
    legal arrangement in which a third party temporarily holds large sums of money
    or property until a particular condition has been met. Escrow services are now
    playing a major role in the field of Blockchain. Escrow can always pay obligations
    or debts, with the help of signature funds, allocated to pay those debts. Escrow’s
    main responsibility is to help dispense money or documents as a neutral third
    party in different exchanges. BTC Asia, IBC Group, Bitrated andGlobal Escrow are
    well known Bitcoin Escrow service providers. Eth (Ether) Ether is next most popular
    cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. It is the currency that powers Ethereum applications
    and is decentralized. In addition to being a tradeable cryptocurrency, it powers
    the Ethereum network by paying for transaction fees (referred to as Gas) and Computational
    services. As it is programmable, developers are using it in many ways. It can
    be used to send and receive funds in real time, swap tokens , earn interest and
    get stablecoins. Infact, Ether is paving the way for a more intelligent financial
    platform based on Decentralised Finance (DeFi) concept. Etherbase Etherbase, also
    called coinbase, is the public key of an Ether account, which is needed by the
    miner to receive a mining reward known as Ether money. Etherhash Etherhash is
    a wallet creating platform allowing users to create wallet by typing password
    only. Users can create anonymous wallets by creating security password. Users
    need to store passwords in a secure place, as any one else who has access to password
    can take the funds away from the wallet. Platform uses EtherHasa to create hashes
    of passwords and stores them using smart contract. Users can deposit ETH only
    on the deposit hash that begins with ‘0x’. After withdrawal, password and deposit
    hash will be deleted, and they cannot be reused for security reasons. New accounts
    need to be created for new deposits and withdrawals. Ethereum It is an open source
    Blockchain that introduced smart contracts functionality. Its native currency
    is called as Ether. Vitalik Buterin, Co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, proposed
    Ethereum in 2013\. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood & Jeffrey Wilcke joined as Co-Founders
    of Ethereum in 2014\. It went through many protocol upgrades since its launch
    with various code name projects like Frontier, Ice Age, Homestead, Spurious Dragon,
    Istanbul and others. Ethereum fueled many innovations in world of Blockchain that
    include Alt Coins, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Smart Contracts, Ethereum Virtual
    Machine (EVM), Decentralize Finance (DeFi) and Non Fungible Tokens. Ether is the
    second most valued cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Ethereum J Ethereum(J) is a pure-Java
    implementation of the Ethereum protocol. It is provided as a library that can
    be embedded in any Java/Scala projects and to offers full support for Ethereum
    protocol and sub-services. Ethereum(J) was first developed by Roman Mandeleil. EVM
    (Ethereum Virtual Machine) Ethereum functions like a distributed state machine
    instead of being a distributed ledger. Ethereum has this machine state in addition
    to all accounts and balances. The data structure can change from block to block
    to a predefined set of rules which can execute machine code too. Every node in
    Ethereum network runs an EVM instance. EVM defines rules that govern changing
    the state from Block to Block. It allows developers to create Decentralized applications
    (DApps) using a specialized language called Solidity. Exchange A digital marketplace
    where buyers and sellers can exchange cryptocurrency for fiat or other cryptocurrencies.
    It usually is an online platform and acts as intermediary. There are over 10,000+
    cryptos that trade currently in over 375 exchanges with a total market capitalization
    of USD 2 Trillion. EXMO EXMO is a British cryptocurrency exchange. EXMO has estimated
    1.8 million users, 8 fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, RUB, PLN, UAH, KZT, TRY),
    SEPA, SWIFT, Credit/Debit cards on the platform. EXMO exchange is registered in
    London, with offices in London, Moscow, and Kyiv, and employs a project team of
    150+ people. Explorer Explorer is a Blockchain module explicitly designed for
    developing user-driven web applications. It can be used for viewing, deploying,
    invoking/querying blocks, network information, transaction data, chaincodes and
    other relevant data that is stored in a Blockchain ledger. Blockchain.com, Blockcypher,
    Tokenview and Tradeblock are good Blockchain explorers.CHAPTER 6 F Fast sync Fast
    sync helps synchronization at a node level by avoiding download of entire blockchain
    and processing one link at a time. It helps in faster syncing with the chain by
    just downloading blocks and checking the merkle tree of validators. Many Blockchain
    protocols offer Fast Sync nodes. Faucet A faucet in cryptocurrency world is a
    website that either gives out small amounts of native cryptocurrency in exchange
    for users completing certain small tasks, or pays out a set quantity of a native
    cryptocurrency’s coins on a testnet (a test network) which can be used for testing
    smart contracts and dApps, before deploying them on the main net (the main network).
    Cointiply, Bonus Bitcoin and Bchain Poker are well known Bitcoin faucets. Fault
    Tolerance & types Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system (computer,
    network, cloud cluster, etc.) to continue operating without interruption when
    one or more of its components fail, thus affecting Reliability, Availability &
    Security. Crash faults happen due to failure of the hardware, software and network
    due to system and electricity failure etc., while Byzantine faults happen due
    to unauthorized access and malicious nodes. Byzantine Fault Tolerance in a cryptocurrency
    is the feature of reaching an agreement or consensus about particular blocks even
    when some nodes fail to respond or give out malicious values to misguide the network. Crash
    fault tolerance (CFT) is one level of resiliency, where the system can still correctly
    reach consensus if components fail. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is more complex
    and deals with systems that may have malicious actors. Practical Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance is a consensus algorithm introduced in the late 90s by Barbara Liskov
    and Miguel Castro. pBFT was designed to work efficiently in asynchronous (no upper
    bound on when the response to the request will be received) systems. It is optimized
    for low overhead time. Asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance (ABFT) is a property
    of Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms, which allows honest nodes in
    a network to agree on the timing and order of a set of transactions, fairly and
    securely. Federated Identity A federated identity is a single identity used by
    a party on a blockchain network to access multiple services across the distributed
    network. It involves using a single key – digital or biometric to sign into systems
    across multiple departments within an organization or multiple organizations.
    With the use of a federated identity, the service providers can track usage of
    their services, while the owner of the identity can trace its use across the network.
    It helps in providing transparency, control of identities and prevents misuse
    or unauthorized access Fiat Currency When the government or the central bank of
    a nation issues a nation-wide currency, that is called a fiat currency. Fiat currency
    may not be backed by gold, silver, oil etc., its value is rather based on the
    faith that citizens have on the central authority issuing such currency. United
    States Dollar, Indian National Rupees, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen are examples
    of fiat currencies. Filecoin Filecoin is a community-based data storage and retrieval
    solution, enabling users to rent their unused storage space on their devices,
    based on Inter-Planetary File System. It was started by Protocol Labs and its
    CEO Juan Benet. The payment by and to the users is via FIL, the native currency
    of the Filecoin blockchain. It uses the proof of replication (PoRep) and proof
    of spacetime (PoST) mechanisms. It is mainly written in Go Language and integrates
    Rust, Javascript and Python too. Filecoin raised US $200 Million within the first
    30 minutes of its launch. Flow Flow is a Blockchain that is relevant for NFT collectibles
    and crypto games. Dapper Labs that developed NBA (National Blockchain Association)
    Topshots – a leading NFT in sports, developed Flow. It came into existence when
    NFTs like Cryptokitties were choking Ethereum circa 2017\. FOMO Fear-Of-Missing-Out
    is a phenomenon defined by a network effect that comes into play when many people
    from the community start showing interest towards a new product, entity, or process,
    and that’s when other ‘prospective users’ in the network start feeling the need
    to get onto the bandwagon, before it’s too late. Many products throughout history
    have gained tremendous traction in terms of pricing or demand owing to FOMO which
    is purely based on emotions rather than underlying valuations. Sudden increase
    in cryptocurrency prices, or sudden interest in a particular cryptocurrency and
    surge in its price is usually on account of FOMO. Crypto FOMOs have resulted in
    as high as 350% premium on Bitcoins. Fork A fork in a blockchain network happens
    when any changes to the underlying protocol take place or fundamental aspects
    pertaining to cryptocurrency need to change. There are two kinds of forks – Soft
    fork and Hard fork. Soft fork occurs when the change is backward compatible, and
    users only need to upgrade their software. Hard fork takes place when the change
    is not backward compatible, and the users have to move to the new chain or else
    take the risk of not being able to mine any blocks further. Hard forks usually
    arise on account of disagreements in the community with respect to proposed changes
    and their implementation. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and Ethereum Classic are
    examples of cryptocurrencies that have appeared owing to Hard Forks. Frontier Frontier
    is a blockchain platform introduced with the goal of aggregating DeFi services
    from multiple platforms into a single chain-agnostic DeFi layer. Its chain agnostic,
    supports DeFi on Ethereum, Binance Chain, Band Chain, Kava and Harmony and hasa
    native currency called as FUSD. Usecases include liquid provisions, staking, asset
    swapping, protocol tracking and management of assets. FUD FUD stands for Fear,
    Uncertainty, and Doubt; it occurs when a particular cryptocurrency or the market
    faces a downward trend because of a propaganda tactic that involves spread of
    negativity and false information by certain individuals or entities. FUD categories
    in cryptocurrency world includes:  No intrinsic value, Criminal usage, Highly
    Volatile, Market Manipulation, Loss of Custody, Product deficits, Government Bans Fungible Fungibility
    means that a particular variety of tokens or assets are interchangeable between
    themselves. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple are fungible tokens – they can
    be exchanged with each other or with fiat currencies. CryptoPunk, Metarift, Art
    Blocks and Hashmasks are Non-Fungible Tokens.CHAPTER 7 G Game Theory Originally
    developed by Mathematician John von Neumann and Economist Oskar Morgenstern, the
    Game Theory includes study of mathematical models that govern strategic interaction
    between various decision makers and helps in determining most likely outcomes
    in a situation that involves known payouts or quantifiable consequences. Basically,
    its a study of why and how people make decisions. It has been applied in Bitcoin
    network, by promoting good behavior through incentivizing miners to use their
    computing power to secure the network and intentionally making mining difficult
    and expensive for malicious actors. It helps in decision making by promoting consensus
    through Proof of Work. In Ethereum’s proposed Proof of Stake, game theory has
    been used to not only reward good behavior but also punish bad actors. Combining
    punishments and rewards strengthens protocol security. Gas Gas refers to the fee
    or pricing value, required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a
    contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform. In essence, it measures computational
    effort required to run operations on Ethereum network. Gas fees are paid in Ethereum’s
    native currency Ether and are denominated in Gwei. Each Gwei is One-billionth
    of Ether. Gas Limit The term Gas Limit refers to the maximum price a cryptocurrency
    user is willing to pay while sending a transaction, or performing a smart contract
    function on Ethereum blockchain. Average Ethereum block has a gas limit of 1.5
    million Gas. Gas Price A general reference to the approximate transaction fees
    to be paid on Ethereum Blockchain. It is measured in Gwei and is determined by
    an auction-type mechanism, where miners look for highest fees attached to a transaction,
    process them first and then process transactions from there-on in descending order. Gas
    Price Oracle It is a tool that helps users to make a prediction on Gas price that
    needs to be made in order to make a transaction confirmed within a certain time
    or number of Blocks in Ethereum. It makes predictions by looking at previous blocks
    utilization and gas limits. It helps users to interpret that paying lower gas
    prices may result in transactions not being selected by miners for validation
    within required time and helps them to modify gas prices accordingly. Genesis
    Block Genesis Block is the name of the first block of blockchain ever mined. The
    Genesis Block forms the foundation of entire blockchain transaction system and
    is the prototype for all other blocks in the blockchain. The Genesis Block for
    Bitcoin was created in January, 2009 that had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ethereum’s
    genesis block was mined into existence in July, 2015 Geth Geth (Go Ethereum) is
    a command line interface for running Ethereum nodes implemented in Go Language.
    Using Geth, one can join Ethereum network, transfer ether between accounts, mine
    ethers and interact with smart contracts. It creates software that runs on the
    Ethereum Virtual Machine. Ghost (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) GHOST originally
    was a protocol modification, a chain selection rule, that makes use of blocks
    that are off the main chain to obtain a more secure and scalable system. It adopts
    orphan blocks – the valid blocks that did not make it to the main chain, as uncle
    blocks so that work from these blocks is included on the main chain. This prevents
    the attacker to overtake the mainchain. It is more relevant and applicable in
    Blockchains where time taken to create new blocks is quite less. Eg: In Ethereum,
    block time is 10 to 20 seconds while in Bitcoin it is 10 minutes. Hence, in Ethereum
    the chances of orphan blocks or stale blocks are very high. Instead of ignoring
    these blocks, Ghost protocol considers them while determining the longest chain
    to ensure network security and prevent centralization. Github GitHub is a code
    hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets users work together
    on projects from anywhere and is home to 60 million repositories accessed by over
    56 million developers. Github helps in Easy Project Management, Effective Team
    Management, Improved Code Writing, Easy Code Hosting and Enhanced Code Safety.
    It began with Git, an open source project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds.
    It is the one of the most prominent DevOps tools used for source code management
    and tracking changes in source code by enabling multiple developers to work simultaneously
    and contribute to non-linear development. Go Lang Go, or Golang, is an open-source
    programming language. Its statically typed and produces compiled machine code
    binaries. Designed at Google in 2007, by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson;
    syntax wise it is similar to C language. The main goal of creating Go was to combine
    the best features of other programming languages to accomplish Ease of use together
    with State-of-the-art productivity especially for scalable servers and software
    systems. Goerli Görli Testnet is the first Proof-of-Authority cross-client testnet,
    syncing Parity Ethereum, Geth, Nethermind, Hyperledger Besu (formerly Pantheon),
    and EthereumJS. This testnet is a community-based project, that is completely
    open-source. Gossip In technical terms, for a blockchain, Gossip is the information
    relayed by each participant repeatedly to another member chosen at random and
    tells them all they know about the transaction. For example, Peer A interacts
    with B, learns about the existence of Peer C and Peer D and connects with them.
    It mimics the way epidemics spread. Different protocols exist for Gossip like
    Dissemination and Compute aggregate protocols. Hedera Blockchain that uses Hashgraph
    consensus is based on Gossip protocol. Governance It refers to the structure that
    every user or participant in Blockchain agrees to follow. It lays down mechanisms
    for Blockchain to adapt and stay relevant with changing times and requirements.
    Core developers, Node holders and Token holders are responsible for governance,
    including Off-chain governance and On-chain governance. Governance may also be
    spoken in the context of consortium formation in a federated blockchain deployment.
    Such a governance is the framework adhered to by the lead participant of a permissioned
    blockchain network. The governance framework helps in providing business rules,
    guidance and contractual conditions amongst consensus forming organizations. Gwei A
    Gwei or gGigawei is defined as 1,000,000,000 wei, the smallest base unit of Ether.
    One gwei equals 0.000000001 ETH or 1 billion gwei equals 1 Ether. Grid Grid is
    Hyperledger’s solution designed to solve supply chain challenges. Interestingly
    enough, Grid is not a Blockchain framework or an application. In essence, it is
    an ecosystem of frameworks, libraries, and technologies that allow developers
    to choose appropriate components for building specific business models. It packages
    various Hyperledger stack components into a single effective business solution.
    Cargill, Target, Intel and Bitwise IO are main users of Grid. Greedy Greedy contracts
    are contracts that remain alive and lock Ether indefinitely. It does not release
    Ether in any condition. This happens in case of Multisig wallet using a parity
    contract to release Ether to owners. In case parity contracts get killed, wallet
    contracts will not be able to access libraries and will be stuck in a situation
    of greed.CHAPTER 8 H Hal Finney Harold Thomas Finney was a developer and first
    employee of PGP Corporation, a cypherpunk and early contributor to Bitcoin development.
    He developed Reusable Proof of Work System (RPoW) modelled on Adam Back’s Hashcash
    protocol. He is credited with operating first Bitcoin software after its release
    and is also the beneficiary of the first Bitcoin transaction wherein he received
    10 BTC from bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto, registered in Block 170\. He continued
    to code even after being paralyzed by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 2009 and
    wrote software for Bitcoin with a computer that tracked his eye movement. Halving Halving
    is an event when the reward for mining a new block of cryptocurrency is reduced
    to half. Halving ensures that supply of cryptocurrencies is restricted which creates
    scarcity and more valuation. In Bitcoin halving happens every 4 years or after
    every 210,000 blocks are mined. Block reward that started with 50 BTCs in 2008
    for Bitcoin will halve every 4 years or after every 210,000 blocks are mined.
    Halving will continue till Bitcoin is halved to its smallest value – 0.00000001or
    Bitcoin mining reaches it supply limit or cap of 21 million which is expected
    to occur in the year 2140\. Hard Fork A hard fork in blockchain technology, is
    a radical change to a network’s protocol that makes previously invalid blocks
    and transactions valid, or vice-versa. A hard fork requires all nodes or users
    to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol’s software. Forks may be initiated
    by developers or members of a crypto community who are dissatisfied with functionalities
    in existing blockchain implementations. Hard forks are also used as a channel
    to crowdsource funding for new technology projects or cryptocurrency offerings.
    Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic have come into existence on account
    of Hard forking of their genesis Blockchain networks. Hard Wallet Also known as
    hardware wallet, it is a cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user’s private
    keys in a secure hardware device like drives or USBs. They facilitate cold storage
    as they are not connected to internet and are not online. They will be connected
    to internet or other devices only when funds are required to be transferred. Ledger,
    Ledger Nano S, Trezor and KeepKey are some of the hardware wallets available for
    use in the market. Hash It is created by Hashing algorithm which takes large sets
    of data and large range of values and converts them into a smaller set of values
    like 128 bit, 256 bit outputs. Hashing algorithms are usually one way function
    – can be used to convert an input into a Hash but cannot be reverse engineered
    to decipher the input based on the hashed algorithm output or hash. It acts as
    the backbone of blockchain network and provides immutability to transactions recorded
    on Blockchain. A hash is developed based on the information present in the block
    header. Hash Function A hash function is any function that can be used to convert
    data of arbitrary sizes to fixed-size values. Values returned by a hash function
    are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are
    usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2
    are examples of different hash functions. Bitcoin uses hash function called double
    SHA-256\. Hyperledger Fabric uses SHA-2 as the default hash function. Hash Tables It
    is used to store keys or value pairs. It uses a hash function to convert the key
    into a hash value or hash which is then used as an index for a respective key
    value pair in the table, that contains several other indexes. They consist of
    Hash function and Array that holds key value entries in the table. They help in
    storing increasing list of records without the possibility of being tampered or
    revised. They also help in reducing the size of data structures and increase the
    data processing speeds. Hashcash Hashcash is a proof-of-work system, based on
    SHA-1 algorithm and invented by Adam Back in 1997\. Its bedrock is based on the
    concept that some mathematical results are easy to verify but difficult to discover
    values that went into calculating the results. It is used to identify duplicate
    emails, limit email spam and reduce denial of service attacks. Hashcash based
    on Proof of Work, became foundation of Bitcoin to solve double counting problem
    that existed in decentralized cryptocurrencies. Hashing Hashing means taking an
    input string of any length, data or information and giving out an output of a
    fixed length. In the context of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the transactions
    are taken as input and run through a hashing algorithm (bitcoin uses SHA-256)
    which gives an output of a fixed length. Its usually a one-way function where
    output cannot be used to predict the input. However same output can be generated
    by using the source data that went in to create the output. Hence, hashing can
    be used easily to verify authenticity of data by computing its hash value multiple
    times over but cannot be used to infer the data, that was used to create it. Hashrate The
    hash rate is a measurement of number of times the cryptocurrency network is able
    to attempt to complete the calculations in every second. Its the approximate average
    of all hash rates of every individual mining machine that is involved in the network.
    Its an important metric used to assess the strength of a Blockchain network and
    its security. Higher the hash rate, harder it becomes for malicious users or attackers
    to manipulate Blockchain network. Hash rates are measured in kilo (1000 hashes
    per second), mega (1 million hashes per second), giga (1 billion hashes per second)
    or tera (1 trillion hashes per second). Ethereum has a hash rate of 400 TH/s (Tera
    Hashes per second) and Bitcoin’s hash rate is 102 TH/s. Haskell First appeared
    in 1990 and stable release in 2010, Haskell is a blockchain programming language.
    Designed for safety, Haskell provides for mandatory automated checks, ensuring
    the elimination of certain kind of mistakes in the code. Prominent features of
    Haskell include memory safety, ease of understanding code, and absence of unwanted
    side-effects. Cardano Blockchain and DAML are based on Haskell. Hexadecimal The
    hexadecimal numeral system, often shortened to “hex”, is a numeral system made
    up of 16 symbols (base 16). The standard numeral system is called decimal (base
    10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\. Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers
    and six extra symbols A, B, C, D, E and F. It is very compact and makes conversion
    with binary easy. In Blockchain world, 256 bit hash is expressed as a number in
    hexadecimal format. HLL (Higher Level Language) The term HLL refers to the computer
    programming languages that not only allow the use of symbolic operators to signify
    operations and symbolic names to represent data and data structures, but are also
    structured with syntax and semantics to describe the computing algorithm. They
    enable program development in a much more user friendly manner and not dependent
    on computer’s hardware and architecture. Examples include Python, Visual Basic,
    Ruby, C#, Java and others. HODL HODL is one of the most frequently used slang
    terms in the crypto community. It has been derived from misspelling of “hold”
    and originated in 2013 when user Gamekyuubi posted an entry that ‘I am Hodling’
    in a Bitcoin forum. He used it to indicate that he is holding onto Bitcoin even
    after prices are falling, owing to his poor trading skills. Now HODL is used to
    indicate holding Bitcoins or cryptocurrencies rather than selling it when prices
    drop. Homestead Homestead is the second major version of the Ethereum platform
    and is the first production release of Ethereum. It includes several protocol
    changes and a networking change that provides the ability to carry further network
    upgrades, however it has few backward incompatible protocol changes. Hence, it
    required a Hard Fork. The first version of Ethereum release was referred as Frontier. Hot
    Wallet A hot wallet is a tool that allows a cryptocurrency owner to receive and
    send tokens. It is connected to the internet unlike a cold wallet and exists in
    Software formats too called as Software wallets. Metamask, Coinbase, Binance andGemini
    are examples of Hot Wallets. Huobi Global Huobi is a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency
    exchange providing trading, storage and wallets. Founded in China, financed by
    ZhenFund and Sequoia Capital, the company now has offices in Hong Kong, South
    Korea, Japan and United States. In August 2018 it became a publicly listed Hong
    Kong company. It supports trading of over 350 cryptocurrencies. Hyperledger Fabric Hyperledger
    Fabric, an open-source project from the Linux Foundation, to develop modular blockchain
    framework, started in the year 2015\. With initial contributions from IBM, SAP,
    Intel and others, it has become the de facto standard for enterprise blockchain
    platforms. Has been focused on developing enterprise-grade applications and industry
    solutions, open, modular architecture uses and plug-and-play components to accommodate
    a wide range of use cases. Hyperledger Fabric is part of Hyperledger Foundation
    that supports other distributed ledger frameworks like Sawtooth, Indy, Burrow,
    Besu, Iroha; tools like Caliper, Cello, Avalon, Explorer and libraries like Ursa,
    Aries, Quilt and Transact. Hyperledger currently has more than 250 members.CHAPTER
    9 I IBFT (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant
    (IBFT) consensus is inspired by Castro-Liskov 99 paper. IBFT inherits from the
    original Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance by using a 3-phase consensus; Pre-prepare,
    Prepare and Commit. The system can tolerate at most F faulty nodes in an N validator
    network, where N = 3F + 1\. It is considered as an alternative to Proof of Work
    in Ethereum and is quite appealing for Consortium and Private Blockchains. It
    was first implemented in Geth and then in Quorum. ICAP (Interexchange Client Protocol) ICAP
    is the world’s largest interdealer broker network for over-the-counter (OTC) trading.
    ICAP, which matches buyers and sellers of bonds, swaps and currencies, has become
    the first company to distribute data on trades to customers using the same blockchain
    technology that powers the virtual currency bitcoin. ICO (Initial Coin Offering) Initial
    Coin Offering refers to raising funds by selling new cryptocurrency offerings.
    Its similar to an IPO (Initial Public Offering) that raises funds, when a new
    company ventures onto the stock market. In ICO, the company raising funds defines
    exchange price between their native cryptocurrency (offering) with other cryptocurrencies
    especially Bitcoin, Ether and also with various other fiat currencies. NEO, Ethereum,
    Stratis and Filecoin had successful ICOs. Some ICOs provided good returns to investors
    but many turned into fraud or failed to provide any returns. IEO (Initial Exchange
    Offering) IEOs appeared on the horizon as many ICOs failed. Unlike ICO, where
    fund raise is carried out by the promoter or project team, IEO has fund raise
    administered by a cryptocurrency exchange. This helps in adequate validation of
    a new Cryptocurrency or Blockchain project that is raising funds and also creates
    required confidence or trust in the project. Binance Launchpad, Gate.io and Bittrex
    IEO are leading IEO platforms in the world. Sero, WazirX, HyperDAO and Mattic
    are examples of successful IEOs completed till date. Immutable Immutability is
    the ability of a blockchain ledger to remain a permanent, indelible, and unalterable
    history of transactions. Immutability has the potential to transform auditing
    process into a quick, efficient, and cost-effective procedure, and bring more
    trust and integrity to the data businesses use and share every day. Indy Hyperledger
    Indy is a distributed ledger, purpose-built for decentralized identity. It supports
    Self Sovereign Identity that empowers individuals to control their identity information
    by allowing them to use it online or offline whenever they want and revoke access
    to such information whenever they don’t want to share such information. This is
    quite different compared to existing systems where owners cease to have visibility
    into the shared identity documents and how they are being used or how many times
    they have been used. Developers can use the tools and libraries from Hyperledger
    Indy to create identity solutions that are interoperable across jurisdictions
    and agencies. Interledger Protocol (ILP) It is a protocol created by Stefan Thomas
    and Evan Schwartz, from the blockchain company Ripple, to move money in easy and
    simple way between two ledgers. ILP does not have a ledger of its own and promotes
    interoperability between different Blockchain networks. Interoperability Interoperability
    is a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood,
    to work with other products or systems, at present or in future, without any restrictions.
    Interoperability is essentially the ability to see and access information across
    various blockchain systems. The ability of different decentralized networks to
    communicate with one another without any intermediaries will go a long way in
    giving rise to fully decentralized systems. World Economic Forum has identified
    three main categories of interoperability methods as on 2021: Cross Authentication,
    Oracles and API gateway. Currently, Blockchains are not interoperable and one
    can operate on only one Blockchain at a time. Eg: Either Bitcoin or Ethereum.
    Blockchain interoperability projects like Polkadot Blockchain and Cosmos Blockchain
    are working hard to change this and make various Blockchains interoperable. IPFS
    (Inter Planetary File System) Created by Juan Benet, The Inter Planetary File
    System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data
    in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify
    each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. IPFS allows
    users to not only receive but also to host content, in a similar manner to BitTorrent.
    As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized
    system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient
    system of file storage and sharing. Brave (browser solution) and Filecoin (co-operative
    storage solution) have used IPFS protocols for designing their services and offerings. Iroha Hyperledger
    Iroha is designed to incorporate Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
    into Mobile or IoT devices. It is based on YAC Consensus, Multisignatures and
    supports Windows, Linux and MacOS environments. It provides alternate design solution
    for mobile based use cases in Identity management and Finance. IOTA Created in
    2015 by David Sonstebo, Dominik Schiener, Sergey Ivancheglo, and Serguei Popov,
    IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger and cryptocurrency designed for Internet
    of things. It uses a directed acyclic graph (also known as Tangle) to store transactions
    on its ledger that provide higher scalability over blockchain based distributed
    ledgers. It is designed to promote microtransactions as it does not use miners
    to validate transactions. In lieu of miners, nodes that enable new transactions
    on the network also approve previous transactions. MegaIOTA units represent IOTA
    trading on different crypto-currency exchanges. IBM Blockchain Platform IBM Blockchain
    Platform is built on the open source, community-based Hyperledger Fabric platform
    from Linux Foundation. Several companies have started their Blockchain journey
    and implementation with IBM Blockchain Platform. IBM offers Food Trust (ecosystem
    of producers, suppliers retailers and manufacturers to create safe and sustainable
    food system for all), Blockchain Transparent Supply (anti-fragile and transparent
    supply chain solutions), TradeLens (transforming container logistics by overcoming
    challenges arising from legacy data systems, manual handling of documents and
    poor visibility). IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) Cloud infrastructure services,
    known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), are made of highly scalable and automated
    compute resources also known as Cloud Computing. IaaS is fully self-service for
    accessing and monitoring computers, networking, storage, and other services. IaaS
    providers maintain infrastructure and users buy cloud computing services based
    on ‘On Demand’ and ‘Pay as you Go’ business models. Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean,
    Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Cloud Stack are some well known IaaS service
    providers.CHAPTER 10 J Jaxx Jaxx is always free to use digital wallet for Bitcoin,
    Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Dash, Zcash and a long list
    of other blockchain assets and cryptocurrencies. Users can trade in cryptocurrencies,
    spend, and receive them using Jaxx. It supports third party apps like Changelly
    and Simplex. Jaxx Liberty Jaxx Liberty is more than a cryptocurrency wallet. It
    has features like cryptocurrency holdings, pricing, news and rewards in the same
    app and acts as a one-stop gateway to manage cryptocurrency wealth. It is available
    and synced across Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux and the Chrome browser. JSON Java
    Script Object Notation (JSON) is a text format used for storing and transporting
    data between computers. It is language independent and very similar to the code
    used for creating JavaScript objects. JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript
    objects as text. JSON files are used to store Blockchain.CHAPTER 11 K Kafka Kafka,
    created and open sourced by LinkedIn in 2011, is a community distributed event
    streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Initially conceived
    as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on abstraction of distributed commit logs.
    Commit log is basically a data structure that only appends; modifications or deletions
    are not possible. Later, Kafka evolved into a full-fledged event streaming platform.
    In Blockchain implementations, it helps in scalability, reliability, durability
    and high performance. It is designed to handle high loads of transactions. For
    lesser loads, message queues like RabbitMQ can be used. Keyfile A Keyfile in a
    blockchain is an encrypted version of a private key. It is generated using a private
    key and a password that one uses to encrypt it. If one opens up a keystore file
    in a text editor, it will show data pertaining to encryption of the private key. Keys There
    are two types of keys in Blockchain - Public key and Private key. Public key usually
    reflects address used for transactions in blockchain. Private key provides access
    to cryptocurrencies or ownership of funds contained in such a given address. A
    Blockchain wallet automatically generates and stores private keys. Private Keys
    establish ownership and helps in signing transactions to spend the funds. Klaytn Kakao’s
    (Korea’s largest mobile platform) global public blockchain project Klaytn is an
    enterprise-grade, service-centric platform that brings user-friendly blockchain
    experience to users. It combines best features of both public and private blockchains
    via an efficient ‘hybrid’ design. Klaytn is secured by participation from numerous
    highly-reputed brands around the globe, working together to create a reliable
    business platform along with robust system of decentralized trust. Klay is its
    native asset that fuels and secures the protocol. Kraken Kraken is a United States-based
    cryptocurrency exchange and bank, founded in 2011, and owned by Payward Inc. It
    supports crypto-currency to fiat-money conversion and trading for 40 cryptocurrencies.
    It streams cryptocurrencies’ price information to Bloomberg Terminals. As of 2020,
    Kraken’s services are available to residents of 48 states in the USA and 176 countries. Kubernetes Kubernetes
    is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads
    and clustering groups of hosts running Linux container and services. It was designed
    by engineers at Google in 2014 and has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. The
    name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. It is often
    called as K8s as there are exactly eight letters between K and S. KYC (Know Your
    Customer) KYC is a set of activities or guidelines in financial services where
    service providers make an effort to verify identity of customers, their suitability,
    and risks involved in maintaining a business relationship with them. KYC documents
    usually encompass Proof of Identity and Proof of Address documents like Passport,
    Driving License, Voters’ Identity and others. KYC helps Banks, Financial Institutions
    and Cryptocurrency exchanges to enforce and accomplish Anti-Money Laundering policies.
    eKYC refers to using internet or digital means to complete identity verification. Kimchi
    premium Kimchi premium is the difference in crypto prices in South Korea compared
    to rest of the world. The kimchi premium is most commonly seen in Bitcoin prices
    and peaked at 55% in January 2018\. Lack of other high return investment avenues,
    deep interest in technology and online gambling have led to occurrence of this
    Kimchi premium in South Korea.CHAPTER 12 L Ledger A ledger is a book containing
    accounts in which classified and summarized information from journals is posted
    as debits and credits. Blockchain is a public electronic ledger built around a
    Peer to Peer (P2P) system that can be openly shared in case of Public Blockchain
    and with permission in case of Private Blockchain. It is shared amongst disparate
    users to create immutable or unchangeable record of transactions, each-one, time-stamped
    and linked to previous one. Libra (Now, Diem) Libra a.k.a., Diem, is a cryptocurrency
    created by Facebook and intended to be used as a simple, low-fee medium of exchange
    around the world. It is backed by a basket of assets, which include major currencies
    and government debt securities that provide pricing stability. Hence it is a stable
    coin. Diem has 26 members that include financial firms, non-profits and Facebook’s
    digital wallet company Novi. Light Client Light clients, also known as partial
    nodes or lightweight clients, are crucial elements in blockchain ecosystems. They
    help users access and interact with a blockchain in a secure and decentralized
    manner without having to sync the full blockchain. They are based on light nodes
    that download only block headers to establish authenticity of transactions. They
    are served by full nodes when connected with entire Blockchain network. Light
    Node Lightweight nodes verify transactions using a method called simplified payment
    verification (SPV). SPV allows a node to verify if a transaction has been included
    in a block, without having to download entire blockchain. With SPV, full nodes
    serve lightweight nodes by allowing them to connect and transmit their transactions
    to the network and will notify them when a transaction affects them. A lightweight
    node needs to download only the headers of all blocks on the blockchain, which
    means that its download and storage requirements are significantly less intensive
    compared to a full node. Lightning Network The Lightning Network is a layer 2
    payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain-based cryptocurrency. It
    is intended to enable fast transactions amongst participating nodes and has been
    proposed as a solution to address bitcoin scalability problem. Transactions between
    parties will be executed off the Blockchain i.e. as off-chain transactions. It
    will reduce transaction processing times and associated costs. Thaddeus Dryja
    and Joseph Poon formulated Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2015\. Linux Foundation The
    Linux Foundation, headquartered in San Francisco, USA, is a non-profit technology
    consortium founded in 2000 as a merger between Open-Source Development Labs and
    Free Standards Group to standardize Linux, support its growth and promote its
    commercial adoption. It promotes adoption of Open or Open source technology. 1.15
    billion lines of code, 235000+ developers and 19000+ contributing companies constitute
    the power and global impact of Linux Foundation. Cloud Foundry, Delta Lake, Drone
    Code, Hyperledger Blockchain, Node.js and Open Chain are well known projects under
    the aegis of Linux Foundation. Lite Coin Litecoin (LTC or Ł) is a peer-to-peer
    cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license.
    Litecoin was an early bitcoin spinoff or altcoin, that started in October 2011\.
    Litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011 by
    Charlie Lee, a Google employee who later became the Engineering Director at Coinbase.
    The Litecoin network went live on October 13, 2011\. It was forked from Bitcoin
    Core client and uses new algorithm Scrypt unlike SHA-256 in Bitcoin. Liquidity
    mining Liquidity mining (or yield farming) is a key feature of DeFi that allows
    people to deposit (or “stake”) one cryptocurrency or token on a Decentralized
    Exchange (DEX) or dApp for rewards. It was popularized by DEXs like Uniswap and
    Compound. Trading is done through token swapping within a liquidity pool. Every
    time a user trades, user will pay a certain fee. Automatic Market Maker (AMM)
    collects fees and grants them to Liquidity Providers as rewards. Liquidity pools Liquidity
    pools are a feature of DEXs that allow people to trade between each other without
    any middlemen.CHAPTER 13 M Main Net Mainnet is the term used to describe when
    a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed as a live network unlike
    Testnet. Mainnet has cryptocurrency transactions that are being broadcasted, verified,
    and recorded on a distributed ledger technology. A mainnet is a blockchain that
    performs the functionality of transferring a digital currency from a sender to
    a recipient. It is also deemed as the final outcome of the project and fulfilment
    of the commitments made in white paper of respective Blockchain project. Market
    Cap (Market capitalization) Market capitalization, or market cap is the aggregate
    market value of a company represented in dollar amount or any other applicable
    fiat currency. Since it represents the market value of a company, it is computed
    based on the current market price of its cryptocurrency and the total number of
    issued cryptocurrencies that are in circulation. Coinmarketcap.com tracks market
    capitalization of almost 5000 cryptocurrencies in addition to cryptocurrency prices,
    price changes in 24 hours and 7 days duration and their circulating supply. Merkle
    Tree Merkle tree, also known as Hash tree, is a data structure that securely and
    efficiently encrypts large amounts of data. It is represented as a tree of hashes,
    in which every leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block,
    and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels
    of its child nodes. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains
    and allow for verifications of large amounts of data. They provide secure and
    efficient verification of large amounts of data. Merkle Patricia Tree Merkle Patricia
    Tree or Merkle Patricia Trie, is a modified form of Merkle tree used by Ethereum
    to optimally store large amounts of data including the ability to save states.
    Merkle Patricia tries to provide a cryptographically authenticated data structure
    that can be used to store all (key, value) bindings. It combines the characteristics
    of a Patricia Trie and Merkle Tree. Patricia trie is a data structure which is
    also called Prefix tree, radix tree or trie and is commonly used for implementing
    routing tables and systems that are used in low specification machines like the
    router. Merkle Root It is the hash of all hashes of all transactions contained
    in the block. It is part of the Block header. By just downloading the small block
    headers and merkle tree, it is possible to establish that a transaction has been
    accepted by Blockchain network. There is no need to download entire Blockchain
    to establish validity of a transaction. MetaMask MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency
    wallet developed by Consensys, used to interact with Ethereum blockchain. It has
    web browser extensions available for Chrome, Firefox and Brave and is used to
    for Ethereum and ERC 20 only. It doesn’t support Bitcoin transactions. It allows
    users to execute Ethereum transactions through regular websites. Metropolis Metropolis
    is the 3rd stage in the 4-stage evolution of Ethereum, after Frontier and Homestead.
    It has lot of interesting features such as:  ZK-Snarks. (Zero Knowledge Succinct
    Non-interactive arguments of Knowledge) that allow verifiers to establish authenticity
    of claims without explicitly exposing the information. i.e. it is based on Zero
    Knowledge Proof Proof of Stake early implementation Flexibility and robustness
    of smart contracts Account Abstraction Micro chain Microchain which is a variation
    of sidechain enables assets of a chain to be transferred to another blockchain.
    In reality, there is no actual transfer of assets from one chain to another. They
    are locked on originating chain and created on destination chain. They also extend
    the consensus rules and logic of smart contracts from one chain to another. The
    side chain is strongly coupled with parent chain and serves as a full validator
    of the parent chain’s consensus rules. Micropayment A micropayment is a small
    transaction, often carried out online, that can be as small as a fraction of a
    cent. Depending on the payments system, a “micropayment” may be defined as any
    transaction size less than $1.00, $5.00, or more. Blockchain technology has brought
    the idea of viable online and instantaneous micropayments back from the dead state
    and it offers a new way to make these tiny payments work. Blockchain removes high
    transaction charges to make micropayments successful. This has been amply demonstrated
    by BuffiDai, a conference coin built on MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin. It demonstrated
    processing cost of all transactions at USD 0.20 only, as compared to a cost of
    USD 2400 that would be incurred if vendors accept credit cards based payments. Miners A
    miner is a node in a Blockchain network that collects transactions and organizes
    them into blocks. Whenever transactions are made, all network nodes receive them
    and verify their validity. Then, miner nodes gather these transactions from the
    memory pool and begin assembling them into a block after validation. In Bitcoin
    network, miners receive two kinds of rewards – New Bitcoins (for finding new Bitcoin
    blocks, solving mathematical problems successfully to obtain private keys pertaining
    to the blocks so that blocks can be confirmed and transactions can be written
    into them) and Transaction fees (for validating transactions so that Bitcoin involved
    in the transaction can be spent). Mining Cryptocurrency mining is the process
    in which transactions between users are verified and added to the blockchain public
    ledger. The process of mining is also responsible for introducing new coins into
    the existing circulating supply, by solving complex mathematical problems with
    the help of computers’ processing power. It is one of the key elements that allow
    cryptocurrencies to work as a peer-to-peer decentralized network, without the
    need for a third-party central authority. Mining Difficulty Mining difficulty
    is a relative measure of the amount of computer resources required for mining,
    Eg: fresh bitcoin. It either increases or diminishes roughly every 2,016 blocks
    in Bitcoin. If previous 2016 blocks were mined easily, the mining difficulty increases
    for next 2016 blocks and vice versa. In Ethereum, difficulty is measured based
    on how many hashes or miners are involved in finding a valid solution to solve
    next Ethereum Block. As more miners or hashing power is added to the network,
    difficulty will increase automatically ensuring new blocks are not added to the
    network quickly. Mining Pool In cryptocurrency mining, a mining pool is the pooling
    of computer resources or compute power by miners, who share their processing power
    over a network, to solve mathematical problems to find new blocks. They split
    rewards equally, according to the amount of compute power and work they contributed
    to finding and solving new blocks. Slush Pool (1.25 million BTC mined), ViaBTC,
    AntPool and BTC.com are some of the leading Bitcoin mining pools in the world.
    SparkPool, Ethpool, Nanopool and Dwarfpool are some of the leading Ethereum Mining
    pools. Mint Bitcoin.com has launched Mint, a free platform that empowers anyone
    to create tokens quickly and easily. Combined with other pro-token products by
    Bitcoin.com, Mint is expected to drive blockchain adoption, as it fuels the development
    of a vast new token ecosystem. Mint is being upgraded to Pitco 2.0\. Mist Mist
    is an all-in-one software to manage all assets and contracts of an individual
    in Ethereum Blockchain. Mist can browse DApps, manage contracts, manage Ether
    and other digital assets. It acts like a window to the Blockchain network and
    accesses different applications and services provided in the network. It also
    supports Whisper (decentralized communication protocol) and Swarm (decentralized
    storage platform). Morden Ethereum version 0.9 was launched under the name Olympic
    in early 2015\. It was the first Public Testnet. By mid 2015, Olympic became deprecated
    and was replaced by Morden. Later, Frontier official Ethereum version 1 was launched
    as public main network in 2015 and was forked to Homestead in 2016\. Morden was
    equivalent to Frontier from a test net perspective. It became deprecated in late
    2016 and was replaced by Ropsten. Multisig (Multi-signature) Multi-signature (Multisig)
    refers to using multiple keys to authorize a blockchain transaction, rather than
    a single signature from one key. It avoids a single-point of failure, making it
    substantially more difficult for the wallet to be compromised. So, a multisig
    wallet can be programmed in such a way that a transaction can be authorized if
    atleast 2 out of 3 keys are used. Electrum, Armory and BitGo are examples of Multisig
    wallets.CHAPTER 14 N NAT (Network Address Translation) NAT translates the IP addresses
    of computers, registered or unregistered, in a local network to a single IP address.
    This address is often used by the router that connects computers to Internet.
    The router can be connected to a DSL modem, Cable modem, T1 line, or even a Dial-up
    modem. Blockchain is empowering Smart NAT management scheme to overcome limitations
    that exist in vertical model. With Blockchain implementation for NAT, every peer
    will agree on necessary parameters required to manage complicated NAT and Mobility
    management procedures. Neo bank A neobank is a kind of digital bank without any
    branches. Rather than being physically present at a specific location, neobanking
    is entirely online. Neobanks are also called as fintech firms that provide digital
    and mobile-first financial solutions payments and money transfers, money lending
    and more. Chime, Monzo, Revolut, N26 and Klarna are some of the top Neo Banks
    globally. Network Value Model In Blockchain network, every participant has to
    have their own value but the network itself should be setup to facilitate it.
    So, the value model is based on principles to create value for 1) everyone funding
    the network 2) everyone who needs this network and 3) everyone using the network
    regularly. Usually, we see a major company building a permissioned or permissionless
    blockchain network, but it’s really the vendors using it who drive the adoption
    and usage of such blockchain network. Hence, the value has to be created for all
    parties and should be done in the design phase of the prototype or the minimum
    viable product (MVP) or network stage. If its not accomplished during MVP stage,
    it should certainly be done in the Go-To-Market stage while scaling from MVP stage
    to ecosystem production state. Nexledger Nexledger is an open-source hybrid, private-permissioned
    blockchain platform developed by Samsung SDS. Nexledger is a full-features platform
    with a core that integrates a range of components such as monitoring tools, external
    linkages, application programming interfaces and a structured DevOps environment.
    It comes in versions that are compatible with Ethereum (Nexledger E) and Hyperledger
    Fabric (Nexledger F). It has two offerings – Nexledger Universal that provides
    API libraries to integrate multitude Blockchain consensus algorithms and Nexledger
    Accelerator that helps in increasing Transaction Per Second (TPS) upto 15 times. NFT
    (Non Fungible Token) A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data on Blockchain
    digital ledger, where each NFT can represent a unique digital item; hence they
    are not interchangeable. NFTs can represent digital files such as art, audio,
    videos, items in video games, virtual assets and other forms of creative work.
    The NFTs can be bought on an NFT marketplace. NFTs have led to a significant growth
    in Digital Collectibles also referred to as Crypto collectibles. Cryptokitties,
    Cypherpunk, Topshots are some of the leading NFTs. They are sold on various market
    places – NBA Top Shot (Basket Ball), Sorare (Soccer), Decentral Land (Virtual
    Real Estate), Axie Infinity (Video Games). NGMI (Not Going to Make It): Its a
    crypto slang used to indicate that a crypto trader or investor is going to miss
    a huge profit in a particular trade. It is also used as a name for a meme crypto,
    where in a person selling a NGMI token will not be allowed to buy back. Nick Szabo Nick
    Szabo is a computer scientist and cryptographer known for his research in digital
    contracts and digital currency. He graduated from the University of Washington
    in 1989 with a degree in computer science and received a law degree from George
    Washington University Law School. The phrase and concept of smart contracts was
    developed by Szabo. He proposed Bit Gold in 1998 – one of the initial efforts
    aimed at creating decentralized virtual currencies. Bit Gold principles resemble
    Bitcoin closely in terms of time stamped Blocks that are stored in title registry
    and created using Proof of Work (PoW). NIPoPoW (Non interactive Proofs of Proof
    of Work) Developed by Universities of Athens, Edinburgh, Illinois and others.
    These are used to verify whether an event has occurred in a Blockchain network
    that runs on Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. These can be verified by
    various nodes in the network without connecting to the Blockchain network and
    without downloading block headers. They support side chains and lightweight blockchain
    wallets on mobile phones. Node JS Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end
    JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript
    code outside a web browser. It was written by Ryan Dahl and released in 2009\.
    Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
    scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before
    the page is sent to the user’s web browser. In addition to Java Script, it is
    also written in C, C++. Node JS is being used to develop Cryptocurrencies and
    set up Blockchains. Nodes Nodes form the infrastructure of a blockchain. They
    store, spread and preserve blockchain data, so theoretically a blockchain exists
    on nodes. A full node is basically a device (like a computer) that contains a
    full copy of transaction history of blockchain. Peer to Peer (P2P) protocol allows
    nodes to interact, communicate with one another in Blockchain network and propagate
    information about new blocks and transactions. Nodes are of three types – Miner
    Nodes, Light Nodes and Full Nodes. Nonce (Number only Used Once) Nonce is a random
    whole number, which is a 32-bit (4 byte) field. It represents the number that
    miners compete to solve and receive cryptocurrency. Miners adjust Nonce so that
    it becomes a valid number to be used for hashing the value of a block. Nonce is
    the number which can be used only once. Once the perfect Nonce is found also known
    as Golden Nonce, it is added to the hashed block. This completes the Block and
    its addition to Blockchain. Along with this number, the hash value of that block
    will get rehashed to create a difficult algorithm that makes Blockchain stronger
    and secure. Notary In the traditional world, a notary is a person authorized to
    perform acts in legal affairs, in particular witnessing signatures on documents.
    Distributed Ledger Technology firm R3 uses the ‘notary service’ to prevent double
    spending in its Corda Blockchain network. A notary cluster is a network service
    that provides uniqueness to consensus by attesting it for a given transaction.
    Its applicable only to transactions that are not signed and those that do not
    consume any of the proposed transaction’s input states. If the transaction has
    already been signed, it rejects the transaction and flags it with a double-spend
    attempt. It represents point of finality for transactions as valid or invalid
    in the system. NVT ratio NVT stands for Network Value-to-Transactions and is calculated
    by dividing Network value with Daily transaction volumes. It was introduced by
    Willy Woo in 2017\. NVT, for cryptocurrencies, can be considered as equivalent
    to Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio that is used to calculate equities’ valuations.
    NVT implies whether Blockchain network or cryptocurrencies overvalued or not.
    If the value of a Blockchain network is too high and it is not substantiated by
    proportionate amount of transactions or coins exchange, it indicates a potential
    pricing bubble that will be corrected soon.CHAPTER 15 O OAuth (Open Authorization) OAuth
    is an open standard for Single Sign On (SSO) and access delegation. It is commonly
    used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications authorization
    or permission to access their information on other websites, but without giving
    them passwords. Eg: Using one’s Google or Facebook Id / Authentication to login
    to other websites or applications. It enables limited access to user’s data. Currently
    there are two versions of OAuth – Version 1 and Version 2\. Off Chain Governance Off-chain
    Governance refers to those rules that apply to transactions occurring in a Blockchain
    or Cryptocurrency network that moves value outside of the blockchain. Off-chain
    transactions are primarily supported to make transactions faster, cheaper and
    more private. They are most suited for non-cryptocurrency transactions. For eg:
    A Digital Identifier can be stored On-chain in Public or Private Blockchain and
    information supporting it like a Passport, Drivers License and Personally Identifiable
    Information (PII) contained in these documents can be stored Off-chain. Offline
    Wallet Also known as Cold Wallet, it is a wallet not connected to internet, therefore
    has a far lesser risk of being taken over or compromised. Electrum Cold Wallet,
    Ledger Nano S, Trezor Model T and Coinbase Vault are good examples of Offline
    Wallets. On Chain On-chain transactions are transactions that occur on a blockchain
    and are reflected on the distributed, public or private ledgers as applicable.
    These transactions cannot be reversed after they are verified and confirmed on
    Blockchain. They can be reversed only if majority of the network agrees to do
    so. Hence they offer very good security and transparency. On chain Governance On-chain
    governance is a system for upgrading blockchains in which code changes are encoded
    into the protocol and decided by stakeholder voting i.e. every node votes on whether
    to accept or reject proposed changes. It promotes Transparency, Faster Consensus,
    Lasting and Binding Code Changes and Decentralized Decision Making. Onclave Onclave
    Networks, Inc. is a global cybersecurity leader that specializes in protecting
    operational technology (OT/IoT) through private networks. It provides Zero Trust
    secure communications platform that protects OT / IoT devices from unauthorized
    access and cyberattacks. Online Wallet Also referred as Hot Wallet, which is connected
    to the Internet and is far more vulnerable to hacks. Exodus and Mycelium Hot wallet
    are examples of Online wallets. OpenShift OpenShift is a family of containerization
    software products developed by Red Hat. It is a Kubernetes distribution focused
    on developer experience and application security which is platform agnostic. OpenShift
    helps to develop and deploy applications to one or more hosts. These can be public
    facing web applications, or backend applications, including micro services or
    databases. Some Blockchain application providers have enabled using of OpenShift
    in a turnkey way to deploy Blockchain capabilities. Open Zeppelin Open Zeppelin
    provides a battle-tested library of smart contracts for secure smart contract
    development on Ethereum. It includes the most used implementations of ERC standards.
    Coinbase, Augur, Bitgo, Brave and Ethereum Foundation are powered by Open Zeppelin. Oracles Oracles
    are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information
    so that decisions can be made by smart contracts. They serve as bridges between
    blockchains and systems in outside world. Cryptocurrency Exchange Pricing and
    Agriculture Insurance are two well known use cases that have proven the importance
    of Oracles to authenticate origin and sanctity of external data sets for smart
    contract execution. For eg: If there is a decentralized crop insurance that covers
    farmers from natural calamities, Oracles sends data to Smart contract governing
    such insurance about extent of damage, so as to authorize or decline insurance
    claims and dispense claims accordingly. Orchestration Orchestration is the automated
    configuration, management, and coordination of computer systems, applications,
    and services. Blockchain can be used to secure Virtual Machine Orchestration for
    cloud computing and network virtualization. Orderer Ordering service provides
    a shared communication channel to clients and peers, offering a broadcast service
    for messages containing transactions. It helps in collating transactions into
    Blocks and distributing them to Anchor peers in the Blockchain network. Ordering
    service, an important functionality of Hyperledger Fabric, also facilitates Channel
    creation by maintaining a list of organizations that are allowed to create them.
    Such list of organizations is called as Consortium. Orphan Block Orphan blocks,
    often referred to as stale blocks, are blocks that are not accepted into the blockchain
    network due to a time lag in the acceptance of such block into the blockchain.
    These also refers to blocks that are submitted to a node without its entire ancestry
    (previous Blocks), hence they cannot be validated. Miners don’t get rewarded or
    incentivized for these Orphan Blocks. OpenChain OpenChain is a public blockchain
    platform developed by Coinprism. This powerful environment helps companies create
    Blockchain systems for experimentation. Anyone can spin up a new instance of blockchain
    on the environment within seconds. Additionally, end-users can exchange values
    on the ledger according to rules identified by the administrator of Blockchain.
    It is most suited for issuance and management of Digital Assets, also supports
    Land titles ownership and management, Music licensing, Gifts cards and Loyalty
    points. Overbought A crypto is said to be overbought if its price has gone up
    over a period of time without any rationale. An overbought crypto is considered
    to be trading above its fair value. Tools like Relative Strength Index are used
    to identify whether a Crypto is Overbought or Oversold and is based on recent
    momentum in pricing, typically over a 14 day period.CHAPTER 16 P P2P (Peer to
    Peer) Peer-to-peer is a decentralized interaction where in two individuals interact
    directly with each other without any intermediary or 3rd party in between. P2P
    computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that distributes
    or divides tasks or workloads between different personal computers also known
    as peers. P2P network shares processing power, network bandwidth and storage space.
    A Blockchain network operates using a P2P network which runs the protocol and
    maintains identical copies of ledgers with recorded transactions. Pancake Swap It
    is a decentralized exchange built on Binance Smart Chain and enables users to
    trade cryptocurrencies without any intermediary. It is powered by automated Smart
    contracts and taps into user generated liquidity pools. Parity Parity is an open-source
    software solution written in Rust programming language. It offers an alternative
    to Geth Ethereum client and allows individuals to run nodes on public Ethereum
    network, or any other blockchain network that uses Ethereum. Parity offers Miners,
    Node operators, and Exchanges, benefits like fast synchronization and maximum
    uptime. PDOs (Private Data Objects) Used in Hyperledger implementations, Private
    Data Objects (PDO) enables sharing of data and facilitates coordination amongst
    parties that do not trust one another. Interaction is facilitated through smart
    contracts that are enforced through execution in Trusted Execution Environment
    (TEE). PDOs perform contract execution and storage off the Blockchain. Only the
    hash representing the Blockchain state is stored on the distributed ledger. PDOs
    help in implementing privacy preserving distributed ledgers. Pegging Linking cryptocurrencies
    value to fiat currencies, gold or other commodities is known as pegging. This
    provides pricing stability to cryptocurrencies that are linked and insulates them
    from significant changes in value. Such linked cryptocurrencies are also known
    as Stablecoins. True USD (TUSD), Tether (USDT), Paxos Standard (PAX) are pegged
    with United States Dollar. Permissioned Blockchain A Blockchain requiring permission
    or prior approval before using it is known as Permissioned Blockchain. It is also
    known as Private or Enterprise Blockchain where Blockchain is hosted by a company
    or an enterprise or an industry body, technically referred to as Central Authority
    that authorizes others to join the Blockchain as trusted validators. Hyperledger
    Fabric, Corda and Quorum are examples of Permissioned Blockchains. Permissionless
    Blockchain Permissionless blockchains are blockchains that require no prior permission
    to join or use them. They are also known as public blockchains. They digitize
    trust and eliminate the need for intermediaries who otherwise are required to
    mediate transactions or foster trust in them. Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples
    of Permissionless Blockchains. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) PKI made its first
    appearance in 1990s to administer and manage encryption keys through digital certificates.
    These digital certificates confirm the identity of people, devices or applications
    that own private keys and corresponding public keys. This ensures that people
    who are sending information through encryption gain required confidence that desired
    recipients of such information are actually the ones who will receive and read
    it. Anyone else who is not the intended recipient, will not have the ability to
    intercept and interpret such information. PKI assigns identities to keys so that
    senders and receivers of information can accurately verify one another. Verisign,
    Gemalto, GlobalSign, WISekey, ENIGMA and eMudhra are leading PKI providers in
    the world. Plasma Created by Vitalik Buterin, Co-Founder of Ethereum, Plasma refers
    to a framework that allows creation of child blockchains that use the main Ethereum
    chain for arbitration and creating trust. It uses smart contracts and verification
    to offload transactions from the main Ethereum chain into a side chain. These
    side chains or plasma chains enable fast and lower cost transactions and their
    validation is preserved on the main Ethereum chain. In essence, Plasma will help
    Ethereum Blockchain handle much larger transactions and speed, thereby addressing
    the performance challenges. PoET (Proof of Elapsed Time) PoET is a blockchain
    network consensus mechanism algorithm, used frequently on permission blockchain
    networks. It is based on Intel’s CPUs called SGX – Software Guard Extensions.
    It prevents high resource utilization and high energy consumption and keeps the
    process more efficient by following a fair lottery system. The algorithm uses
    a randomly generated elapsed time to select the node that will win the new block.
    Miners generally go to sleep and don’t participate in mining while waiting for
    their turn. Hence it facilitates energy efficient mining. Polkadot Polkadot is
    a heterogeneous multi-chain interchange possessing a translation architecture
    that enables customized side-chains to connect with public blockchains. It allows
    data and tokens to be transferred across Blockchains thereby facilitating cross-chain
    registries and computations. Polkadot’s first token sale closed on October 27,
    2017 raising a total of 485,331 ETH. Gavin Wood, Thiel Fellow Robert Habermeier
    and Peter Czaban are the co-founders of Polkadot. Gavin Wood was previously the
    Chief Technology Officer and is co-founder of the Ethereum Project. It is also
    a flagship project by Web3 Foundation to build a fully functional and decentralized
    web. Private Blockchain A private blockchain is an invitation-only blockchain.
    The blockchain is governed by a single entity. The participating parties require
    permission to read, write, or audit the blockchain. The blockchain can have multiple
    layers of data access to keep certain pieces of data confidential. Also known
    as Permissioned Blockchain. Private Keys A private key, also known as a secret
    key, is a variable in cryptography that is used with an algorithm to encrypt and
    decrypt messages or information. Secret keys are only shared with the key’s generator,
    making it highly secure. Private keys play an important role in symmetric cryptography,
    asymmetric cryptography and cryptocurrencies. Proof of Activity (PoA) Decred,
    a well known cryptocurrency, uses Proof-of-activity which is a hybrid consensus
    algorithm. PoA is a combination of two other blockchain consensus algorithms:
    Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). It is used to ensure that all transactions
    occurring on the blockchain are genuine and that all miners arrive at a consensus.
    Blocks that are mined do not contain transactions; they contain only header information
    and mining reward addresses. Network fees or rewards are shared between miners
    who find the blocks and validators who sign the blocks. Proof of Authority Proof
    of Authority (PoA) is a reputation-based consensus algorithm that introduces a
    practical and efficient solution for blockchain networks, especially the private
    ones. The term was proposed in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin
    Wood. Rights to generate new blocks are given to nodes that have proven their
    authority; authority is obtained through clearing preliminary authentication.
    Benefits of PoA include –  No need for high performance hardware High transaction
    rates New blocks generation time or intervals are predictable IOTW Blockchain
    uses PoA consensus algorithm. Proof of Burn Proof-of-Burn (PoB) is a blockchain
    consensus mechanism that requires minimal energy consumption compared to proof-of-work
    (PoW). In this mechanism, miners burn coins by sending them to addresses from
    which coins cannot be retrieved instead of investing in expensive computers to
    mine. This burning provides miners a privilege to mine based on random selection
    process. Slimcoin and Third Generation Coin (TGCoin) use Proof of Burn consensus
    mechanism. Proof of Stake A consensus mechanism used to achieve distributed consensus.
    In case of Ethereum, it requires users to put on stake their Ether to become a
    validator. Validators are chosen randomly to create blocks and are responsible
    for checking and confirming blocks they do not create. This confirmation or validation
    is like attestation. Validators obtain rewards for proposing new blocks that are
    good and not malicious and lose their stake in-case they attest malicious blocks.
    Proof of Stake consensus mechanism is better than Proof of Work in energy utilization
    and providing higher immunity to centralization. Owing to energy efficiencies,
    cryptos using Proof of Stake are also knows as green cryptos like Cardano, Polkadot,
    Neo and Cosmos. Proof of work Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus
    mechanism used to secure cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. It
    is used for validating transactions and mining new tokens or coins. It is based
    on the premise that there are set of values which are difficult to produce but
    easy to verify. Miners club group of transactions into a block and try to mine.
    To mine the block, hard mathematical problem called ‘Proof of Work’ has to be
    solved. The solution lies in finding a number lower than the hash of the block,
    which is also known as target hash. Lower the target is, higher the difficulty
    to generate a block. Miners continue testing various values known as Nonces using
    compute power till the right value is found to solve the problem. Miner who solves
    the problem successfully gets the Block reward and adds the block to the network
    and broadcasts that block has been mined. Once the problem has been solved others
    can verify it easily based on Proof of Work algorithm. SHA 256, Scrypt and SHA-3
    are some of the well-known algorithms powering Proof of Work. Protocol Protocols
    are basic sets of rules governing sharing of data between computers. For Cryptocurrencies,
    they establish guidelines pertaining to structure of the blockchain, consensus
    mechanisms and distributed database that allows digital money to be securely exchanged
    in the network and over the internet. Public Blockchain A public blockchain is
    also known as Permissionless Blockchain. Anyone can join the Blockchain network
    and information is available in a public domain. Due to its permissionless nature,
    any party can view, read, and write data on the blockchain and such data is accessible
    to all. No particular participant or a node in the network has full control over
    the data contained in a public blockchain. Bitcoin and Ethereum are good examples
    of Public Blockchain. Public Keys A public key is a large numerical value that
    is used to encrypt data or information. This key can be generated by a software
    program but in practice is usually provided by a trusted, designated authority
    known as certification authority. The messages encrypted by public keys can be
    deciphered using a private key which is held by recipient of information and the
    key is known only to them. Every public key matches with only one private key. Pyethereum Pyethereum
    is the Python core library of the Ethereum project. In other words, it refers
    to implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine using Python programming language.
    It was written by Vitalik Buterin Python Invented by Guido van Rossum in the year
    1991\. It is a high-level object oriented programming language with dynamic semantics.
    It has gained popularity and wide adoption owing to simple programming syntax,
    English like commands and readability of its code. It is widely used for web development,
    machine learning, artificial intelligence and mobile application development.
    Latest version of Python is version 3.9 released in October 2020\. Python allows
    developers to create Blockchain using only minimal lines of code and also comes
    with several free packages that make Blockchain code more efficient. PaaS (Platform
    as a Service) It’s a business arrangement or model where users of PaaS need not
    install in-house hardware and software to develop or operate applications. The
    PaaS provider delivers software and hardware tools to users over the internet
    using cloud computing technology. Users will pay based on their usage – “Pay as
    you Go” pricing model. PaaS is delivered through public, private or hybrid cloud
    platforms. Various types of PaaS include Open PaaS, Mobile PaaS, Hybrid PaaS,
    Private PaaS and Public PaaS. Google, Red Hat, Oracle, IBM, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS) and Microsoft are leading PaaS providers. Pump and dump It refers to buyers
    accumulating cryptocurrencies or tokens with an intention to manipulate the pricing
    upwards by creating bullish sentiments and spreading wrong information, leading
    to price inflation (pumping) and then selling them all at once which causes prices
    to crash (dumping). PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) Developed by Phil Zimmermann in
    1991 as free email security program, Pretty Good Privacy is an encryption program
    used for signing, encrypting and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories
    and whole disk partitions. PGP uses International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)
    invented by Xuejia Lai and James Massey in 1991, which is the private key protocol
    and uses RSA as public key encryption system. It uses both Public and Private
    cryptosystem to increase the security and privacy of data and e-mail communications. PGP
    survived law suits from NSA and US Government in its early days as it helped people
    and enterprises to secure their communications and insulate them from trapdoors
    that would have existed in secure communications equipment so that messages could
    be decrypted and read by the Government.CHAPTER 17 Q Quartz Quartz is a startup
    incubated by TCS, and provides foundational technology, tools and business components
    for creating distributed ledger through their offering The Smart Ledgers. It comprises
    Quartz Smart Solutions – set of business solutions for various industries, Quartz
    Devkit – smart contracts development kits, Quartz Gateway – helps in easy integration
    of existing applications with Blockchain networks and Quartz Command Center –
    helps in monitoring entire ecosystem. Quantum Computing Quantum computing is the
    use of quantum phenomenon such as superposition and entanglement to perform computations
    at a much faster rate compared to classical computers that we use today. Computers
    that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers. The most widely
    used Quantum computer model is the quantum circuit, based on the quantum bit,
    or “qubit”, which is somewhat analogous to the bit in classical computation. A
    qubit can be in a 1 or 0 quantum state, or in a superposition of the 1 and 0 states.
    When it is measured, however, it is always 0 or 1; the probability of either outcome
    depends on the qubit’s quantum state immediately prior to measurement. Quantum
    computing movement began in 1998 when Isaac Chuang, Neil Gershenfeld and Mark
    Kubinec created the first quantum computer with 2 Qubits. IBM Q, Google Sycamore
    and Intel Tangle Lake are well known Quantum computers with close to or greater
    than 50 Qubits. D-wave has Quantum computers with greater than 128 Qubits but
    based on Quantum Annealing. Quantum computers are expected to transform medicine
    by increasing drug discovery speeds, transform communications and artificial intelligence.
    In Blockchain world, they are expected to impact the cryptographic principles
    that power Blockchains. Quorum Quorum, originally created by JP Morgan and now
    overseen by Consensys, is an open source blockchain protocol, derived from fork
    of Ethereum by modifying the Geth client. It is specially designed for use in
    private blockchain networks. Quorum protocol can be used when there is only a
    single member owning all the nodes, or, a consortium blockchain network, where
    multiple members each own a portion of the network. It is transforming use cases
    pertaining to Trade Finance, Supply Chain Finance, Commercial Bank Payments, Institution
    Trading, Debt Issuance, Loan Marketplaces, Insurance, Healthcare and Digital Identity. Quilt Hyperledger
    Quilt is a one of the business Blockchain tools that aims to facilitate interoperability
    between ledger systems by implementing the Interledger protocol (ILP), which is
    a payments protocol used for moving value across both distributed and non-distributed
    ledgers. It facilitates distributed atomic transactions (data movement to validate
    transactions) between IOT companies’ wallets, Financial Institutions Ledgers and
    different supply chain systems. Everis, NTT Data and Ripple are pioneering development.CHAPTER
    18 R R3 R3, founded in 2014 by David E Rutter and Todd McDonald, is an enterprise
    software firm that is pioneering digital transformation through Enterprise Blockchain
    Technology. R3’s solutions deliver trust across Financial Services industry and
    other verticals too where there was a trust deficit pertaining to how enterprises
    or firms collaborated and transacted with one another. R3’s purposely built Enterprise
    blockchain platform Corda is digitalizing processes and systems that firms rely
    on, to connect and transact with each other through Blockchain networks in Trade
    Finance, Insurance, Banking and Capital Markets. More than 350 institutions are
    deploying, servicing and building on R3’s offerings. R3 has also developed Conclave
    – a Confidential Computing Platform to foster privacy in Enterprise applications
    where multiple users can securely share and analyze data. Rabbit MQ RabbitMQ,
    owned by VMware, is an open-source message-broker software that 1\. Supports Asynchronous
    Messaging covering multiple messaging protocols, message queuing and flexible
    routing to queues, 2\. Helps in developing cross language messaging with languages
    like Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Javascript and others 3\. Comes with Distributed
    Deployment and 4\. Is Enterprise & Cloud Ready. Rabbit MQ was originally implemented
    with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol and later it has been extended to support
    Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), MQ Telemetry Transport and
    other protocols. React JS Created by Jordan Walke in 2011 while working for Facebook,
    is primarily used to build web applications and handling the view layer for Web
    and Mobile Apps. It allows developers to create large web applications that can
    change data without reloading the page and supports server-side. In Blockchain
    world, it is being extensively used to develop Cryptocurrency dashboards and building
    Ethereum Decentralized Applications (dApps) RxJS Reactive Extensions for Java
    Script (RxJS) is a JavaScript library for transforming, composing and querying
    asynchronous streams of data or call back code. RxJS can be used both in the browser
    or on the server-side. REKT REKT is an internet slang for “wrecked,” meaning severely
    damaged or utterly destroyed and ruined. In crypto world, REKT refers to someone
    who has experienced a heavy financial loss due to a wrong trade or investment.
    It is also used to refer digital assets that lose value. Relayer Relayer is an
    entity that enables hosting a 0x order book that is filled with a number of individually
    signed orders from various Ethereum addresses. For order fulfillment, direct settlement
    is carried out on Ethereum Blockchain using deployed 0x smart contracts. Fees
    for hosting and facilitating orders are collected in ZRX tokens. Reputation Reputation
    is used as an incentive to increase overall trustworthiness in Blockchain whereby
    miners or validators urge to add a block into blockchain when it has the highest
    trust value. The authors do not make any assumptions about nodes behavior, and
    thus, malicious behavior can compromise required consensus. Rest API Created by
    computer scientist Roy Fielding, a REST API is an application programming interface
    that adheres to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction
    with RESTful web services. An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building
    and integrating application software. REST API is also known as RESTful API. It
    was created with an intention to establish standard that allows two servers located
    anywhere in the world to communicate and exchange data. Rinkeby Rinkeby is an
    Ethereum testnet. Testnets are typically used by developers to test their applications
    or software before deploying them in production or mainnet. Crypto-currencies
    held on testnet does not contain any value. Rinkeby testnet, unlike Ethereum mainnet,
    is a Proof-of-Authority network, as opposed to a Proof-of Work network like Ethereum
    mainnet. Rinkeby has average block time of 15 seconds and average network hashrate
    of 0.1 Hexa hashes per second. Ripple Founded in 2012 by Chris Larsen and Jed
    McCaleb, Ripple was initially known as Opencoin before the name was changed to
    Ripple Labs in 2015\. Ripple Labs created Ripple as a real-time gross settlement
    system, currency exchange and remittance network. It is built upon a distributed
    open-source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency,
    commodities, or other units of value. XRP is the native currency. Its RippleNet
    hosts payment providers like Banks, Financial Institutions and Money Remittance
    providers who use Ripple solutions to transfer money globally at lower cost and
    increased speeds. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Bruce Jay Nelson is believed to
    have coined the term RPC in 1981\. It helps in building distributed, client-serverbased
    applications and is architected on local procedure calling where in the called
    procedure may not exist in the same environment or network as the calling procedure.
    In Blockchain network, RPC facilitates more direct connection, it is initiated
    by the client and sends a message to the Blockchain node. Users can query for
    blockchain related information such as block number, blocks, node connection through
    RPC interface and send transaction request. Ropsten Ropsten is a proof-of-work
    testnet launched in 2016 due to multiple issues in the old testnet and resembles
    the current Ethereum blockchain. Ropsten Ethereum, also known as Ethereum Testnet,
    as the name implies is a testing network that runs the same protocol as Ethereum
    does and is used for testing purposes before deploying on the main network called
    Mainnet. Ropsten was attacked in February 2016 with Ropsten address swarming the
    Blockchain with thousands of auto generated, faulty transactions. It was revived
    on March 2017 with developers rewriting Ropsten Blockchain. RSI (Relative Strength
    Index) It is an important indicator used in Technical Analysis where in quantum
    of recent price changes are used to ascertain oversold or overbought conditions
    for stocks and other assets. RSI value of 70 and above indicates overbought or
    overvalued situation and may indicate trend correction and price adjustments downwards.
    RSI reading of 30 indicates undervalued situation. In Cryptocurrencies, RSI indicator
    is based on crypto’s price change and speed of this change. Rugging / Rugpull This
    occurs when developers abandon a cryptocurrency or blockchain project and escape
    with investors’ funds. Many rugpulls have occurred on Decentralized Exchanges
    (DEXs) as DEXs allow easy listing of tokens without any prior due diligence. Rugging
    also refers to liquidity being removed from liquidity pools. To prevent rugging,
    projects have implemented measures to commit liquidity through locking contracts
    and token burn related to liquidity pools. DeFi100 coin creators have rug pulled
    close to USD 32 million. SushiSwap has also suffered from rugging.CHAPTER 19 S Satoshi A
    Satoshi is the smallest unit of a bitcoin, equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin.
    Bitcoins can be split into smaller units to facilitate smaller transactions or
    micro payments. It has been coined in the honor of Bitcoin’s founder - Satoshi
    Nakamoto. Satoshi Nakamoto Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous
    person or persons who developed world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency called
    Bitcoin using Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology. Satoshi Nakamoto authored
    the Bitcoin white paper called ‘Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’, created
    and deployed Bitcoin’s original implementation. As part of the implementation,
    Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database and mined first Bitcoin. It
    is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto possesses 1 million Bitcoins. Sawtooth Hyperledger
    Sawtooth is an open-source enterprise blockchain-as-a-service platform that can
    run customized smart contracts without the need to know the underlying design
    of the core system. It uses Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) consensus mechanism and
    allows smart contract development using Python, Javascript, Rust, Go & C++ languages.
    It can be deployed as Permissioned or Permissionless Blockchain. Intel, T Mobile,
    IBM and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are major users of Sawtooth. Schnorr A Schnorr
    signature is a digital signature produced by the Schnorr signature algorithm that
    was described by Claus Schnorr. It is a digital signature scheme known for its
    simplicity, whose security is based on the intractability of certain discrete
    logarithm problems. It is efficient and generates short signatures. It was covered
    by US patent, which expired in 2 years on Feb 2008\. It is used to implement ‘Proof
    of Knowledge’ Scrypt Created by Colin Percival, it’s a password based key deciphering
    or interpretation algorithm. It was originally used to make large scale hardware
    attacks unviable. Authorized users need to perform only once while authentication,
    however a brute force attacker will need to perform the operation billion times
    within the given time interval making the attack unviable and unsuccessful. Scrypt
    algorithm has been designed in such a way that it uses large amount of memory
    unlike other password Key Derivation Functions (KDF) like PBKDF2\. Many cryptocurrencies
    like Litecoin, Dogecoin, Viacoin and Gulden have adopted simplified version of
    Scrypt for Proof of Work based consensus in their respective protocols. SDK (Software
    Development Kit) A software development kit (SDK) represents set of tools and
    programs provided by vendors to help developers and build applications for various
    uses. SDKs are usually associated with mobile apps. Eg: Android tool kit is used
    to build Android apps and iOS SDK is used to build Apple apps. APIs, Integrated
    Development Environment, tools pertaining to building, running, testing and debugging
    are included in SDKs. There are over 1000 SDKs available to build Blockchain and
    Cryptocurrency applications. Eg: Hyperledger Fabric SDKs, Corda Token SDK and
    Cosmos Ethereum Virtual Machine SDK. SegWit (Segregated Witness) SegWit refers
    to process changes made in Bitcoin regarding storage of transaction data by increasing
    the Block size, it was accomplished by removing signature data from bitcoin transactions.
    When certain parts of a transaction are removed, it frees up space or capacity
    to add more transactions to the chain. It went live in August 2017 after being
    released in 2015\. It also helped to fix tampering in Bitcoin transaction ids,
    that was possible earlier. SegWit2X was a proposal to increase Bitcoin’s block
    size from 1 MB to 2MB. SegWit2X developers wanted to hard fork the Bitcoin to
    carry out these changes but abandoned it, owing to lack of consensus. Self-Destruct It
    is a function provided on Ethereum network where in self-destruct smart contract
    when triggered, destroys the contract. It is useful in cases of attacks, where
    self-destruct function removes smart contract from Ethereum and transfers Ether
    to the owner’s address. Majority of developers use self-destruct function to deploy
    an updated contract after destroying the old contract. Self-Executing Smart contracts
    are self-executing contracts. They contain terms and conditions of an agreement
    which are embedded into the software code and are replicated amongst peers in
    the Blockchain network. Serenity Ethereum 2.0 version is referred as Serenity.
    It is an upgrade of existing Ethereum on the main net. New features include implementation
    of sharding to facilitate replacement of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus with Proof
    of Stake (PoS), leading to an increase in transaction speeds. Serenity will be
    launched in three phases with third phase implementation to be completed by mid
    of the year 2022\. Topaz, Rinkeby, Medella, Zinken are some of the test networks
    of Serenity. Serpent In encryption standards, Serpent refers to block cipher application
    that came second to Rijndael in Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Contest. It
    was developed by Lars Knudsen, Ross Anderson and Eli Biham. Serpent has a block
    size of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits. In Blockchain
    world, Serpent, developed by Vitalik Buterin, refers to programming language that
    is used to write smart contracts in Ethereum. It is very similar to Python. It
    was deprecated as Vitalik believed that its technology has become outdated, hence
    has security concerns. SGX (Software Guard Extension) Intel introduced SGX in
    2015 and it represents security set instructions baked into Intel’s x86 based
    Central Processing Units (CPUs). SGX facilitates better protection of user’s sensitive
    information by splitting computer’s memory into enclaves. Enclaves are private
    and predefined areas in memory. For Blockchain, SGX delivers enhanced privacy
    and security to protect the transactions and also helps in increasing consensus
    efficiency and throughput. SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) Created by National Security
    Agency in 2001for use in digital signatures. It is well adopted by Public Key
    Infrastructure market for digital signatures. It is widely used in security applications
    and protocols including TLS, SSL, PGP, SSH, IPsec, and S/MIME. SHA – 256 algorithms
    are used in blockchain to get a constant hash of 256 bits every time. This algorithm
    is also a part of encryption technology. Sharding Sharding is a database architecture
    technique that results in horizontal partitioning of data contained in a database.
    It is the practice of separating one table’s rows into multiple different tables,
    known as partitions. In Blockchain, sharding is used to increase transaction speed
    by splitting Blockchain into small sections called as Shards. Each Shard will
    have its own set of account balances and smart contracts. Each node will have
    only a part of data on the Blockchain and not entire information. Zilliqa is the
    first public blockchain to implement sharding. Shill A shill is a person who publicly
    helps or provides credibility to a person or an organization without disclosing
    that they have a close relationship with them. Shill in cryptocurrency refers
    to a person holding some cryptocurrency and trying to promote that particular
    coin or token brand to increase its price and sell their holdings to book profits.
    John McAfee is considered to be a well-known Shill in the cryptocurrency world. Side
    Chains A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain
    with a two-way peg for exchange of transactions from main chain to side chain
    and vice versa. They provide efficiency and scalability to mainchain. Sidechains
    may have their own consensus protocols, which may be completely different from
    the mainchain’s protocol. The two-way peg also enables interchangeability of assets
    from one blockchain to another securely at a predetermined rate. Single Point
    of Failure It is a malconfiguration, weakness or a flaw in a system that causes
    it to come to a grinding halt and stop working. It can also be due to malicious
    attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
    attacks. Centralized systems are often prone to single point of failure. Distributed
    and decentralized systems like Blockchain are insulated from such failures. Single
    Source of Truth A single source of truth is the practice of aggregating data,
    information from many operating or business systems within an organization into
    a single location, ledger or system. In blockchain, a single source of truth means
    every node that is in the network contains same data. This results in a situation
    where information cannot be altered without the knowledge of others on the network,
    leading to immutability. Basically error proof and tamper proof system of records. Slashing
    Condition Slashing is a mechanism built into proof of stake blockchain protocol
    to discourage validators’ misbehavior such as persistent downtime, double signing
    and delegation. Punishments include reduction in stakes and suppression of future
    rewards and ejection. Slashing is thus designed to incentivize node security,
    availability, and network participation. Ethereum 2.0, Celo, Cosmos, ICON and
    Polkadot have various slashing penalties for downtime, delegation and double signing. Smart
    Contracts Smart contracts, first proposed by Nick Szabo in 1994, are simply programs
    stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They are
    used to automate execution of agreements so that all participants are aware of
    outcomes and abide by them; without any time loss or intermediaries’ involvement
    to enforce outcomes. Ethereum is world’s most popular smart contracts platform
    that uses Solidity for writing smart contracts that run on Ethereum Virtual Machine. Soft
    Fork Soft fork occurs when changes to Blockchain protocols are backward compatible
    and users only need to upgrade their software. Its pretty much like upgrading
    operating system of a smart phone, tablet or a smart watch to fix bugs and update
    security features. Post the soft fork, there will be only one Blockchain unlike
    Hard fork where Blockchain splits into two. Metropolis in Ethereum is a good example
    of soft fork Solidity It was proposed by Gavin Wood and developed by Christian
    Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi and several former Ethereum core contributors.
    Solidity was shaped by C++, Javascript and Python, designed to interact with Ethereum
    Virtual Machine. In essence, it is the base of the Ethereum Network and enables
    developers to create their own decentralized applications (dApps). dApps can run
    smart contracts to accomplish activities like transmitting money, exchanging shares
    or moving anything of value based on predefined conditions. Sovrin Sovrin Foundation,
    established in the year 2016, is a private-sector, international non-profit that
    was established to govern the Sovrin Identity Network. The Sovrin Network is a
    public, permissioned distributed ledger purpose built for protecting identities
    on internet wherein individuals should own and control their identities without
    the intervention of administrative authorities, hence known as Self Sovereign
    Identity (SSI). Sovrin Foundation provides lightweight governance that is needed
    to operate SSI network in a trustworthy manner. SPV Client (Simple Payment Verification) It
    is a technique that has been first described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper. It allows
    a lightweight client to verify that a transaction is included in the Bitcoin blockchain,
    without downloading entire blockchain. It is often used in Bitcoin wallet apps
    running on smart phones, by using special SPV nodes that act as an intermediary
    between the app and a mining node. SQL (Structured Query Language) First developed
    by IBM researchers in 1970s, SQL is a standard language used for storing, querying
    and retrieving data in databases. It is used for database creation, deletion,
    fetching and modifying rows. SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) SSI is an identity
    verification and authentication model that is based on the premise that individuals
    should own and control their identities. It provides security and flexibility
    to users, empowering them to share their information only when they intend to
    do so. It is free from interventions exercised by administrative authorities or
    centralized- or federated-identity providers and acts on the concept that no one
    owns but everyone has access. It eliminates the need for collecting documents
    that have already been collected somewhere else. Validators get only that information
    that users have authorized to share and such information is cryptographically
    shared on distributed ledger which prevents modification. Evernym and Sovrin are
    well known companies working on SSI. Stable Coins Stable coins are cryptocurrencies
    whose value is pegged to market value of assets or currencies that reference them.
    Stable coins may be pegged to a currency like the U.S. dollar or to a commodity’s
    price such as gold. Most popular stable coins are Tether, Diem, USD coin, Dai,
    PAX. They generally provide pricing stability unlike other cryptocurrencies, hence
    they are very popular with investors and users who don’t like excessive volatility
    in prices. Stale Block These blocks are also known as Orphan blocks which are
    successfully mined but are not included on the current best block chain. This
    occurs when blocks are added to the chain that is not the longest one. In Bitcoin
    blockchain, only the longest chain wins and takes the blockchain network forward. State State
    reflects all committed transactions on the blockchain. This is basically a key-value
    store which is updated as a result of transactions and chaincode execution. For
    this purpose, either LevelDB or CouchDB is used. State Channel A channel is a
    private blockchain overlay which allows for data isolation and confidentiality.
    Using state channels, users transact with each other directly outside the Blockchain
    network as they go off the chain. They help in increasing the throughput of Public
    blockchains as they reduce the load for nodes while processing and storing transactions.
    They are also expected to reduce the cost of using Ethereum network as users pay
    transaction fees (also known as gas) only while opening and closing channels and
    not for the entire transaction. Static Nodes They represent set of trusted nodes
    that are pre-configured. In Hyperledger Besu, static nodes are exempt from certain
    limitations like maximum peer and remote connection limits. Static nodes are also
    used as an alternate method to find peers. Stellar Stellar is Distributed Ledger
    Technology (DLT) powered Payments protocol. Stellar makes it possible to create,
    send and trade digital representations of all forms of money—dollars, pesos, bitcoin
    and other currencies It’s designed in a way that all of world’s financial systems
    can work together on a single network. Lumen is the native currency of Stellar,
    100 billion Lumens were created during inception of Stellar Network. Steward Used
    in Sovrin Network that promotes usage of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) on internet.
    Sovrin Stewards are organizations that operate the network by running validator
    nodes which write to and read the Sovrin ledger. These trusted volunteers donate
    time, resources, and computing power to operate and maintain the network while
    agreeing to abide by the requirements of the Sovrin Governance Framework. There
    are currently 50 Stewards from 13 countries over 6 continents. Suicide contract Suicidal
    contract is a contract with a security fallback option of getting killed by its
    owner or through a trusted address. This is generally used in emergency situations
    such as when funds are being siphoned either due to attacks on wallet or account
    or due to incorrect functioning. Swarm Swarm is a distributed storage platform
    and content distribution service, built on Ethereum Blockchain with native token
    called as BZZ. Swarm users upload data to the network and such data is split into
    small chunks. Incentives make sure that node operators will be rewarded for discovery,
    storage and propagation of chunks. Swarm Accounting Protocol (SWAP) ensures that
    node operators collaborate in routing messages. ZetaSeek (user specific search
    engine), Upala (unique identity for dApps), Waggle (spam free, decentralized email
    service) and Swarmify (decentralized music streaming) are projects that are being
    built on Swarm. Syncing Syncing in blockchain represents synchronizing with the
    mainnet. When a new node is launched, it needs to sync with the current blockchain
    right from the genesis block. New nodes need to catch up and come to speed with
    the network before contributing to the network or validating transactions. Syncing
    may take lot of time depending on the protocol and node type. To speed up syncing
    of node with Blockchain, imaging technologies are being used. Synthetic Derivatives These
    represent securities that are reverse engineered to obtain cash flows from a single
    security. They are engineered to simulate derivatives while changing important
    attributes like cash flow and duration. There is a Blockchain protocol called
    Synthetix that enables synthetic assets issuance on Ethereum Blockchain. They
    are usually in the form of ERC 20 smart contracts called Synths that provide returns
    on assets without owning assets. Synths can be traded based on cryptocurrencies,
    indexes or real-world assets like precious metals. Security Tokens They represent
    ownership in assets or company and provide token holders a share of returns on
    the asset or profits in the company. In essence, they are tradable financial assets.
    They are different from utility tokens; utility tokens are used in the ecosystem
    like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. Security tokens on other hand, provide ownership
    of the ecosystem. Offerings which involve sales of security tokens to raise funds
    are known as Security Token Offerings (STOs). Sapien Equity Token, Robinhood Casino
    and Solarstake are examples of STOs Slippage Slippage is the price difference
    between the expected price of a crypto trade and the actual price at which the
    crypto is traded. This occurs on account of price movement between the time trade
    order enters the market and the time it is actually executed. The best way to
    prevent slippage is through the use of price limit orders instead of placing market
    orders. Limit orders set maximum buy limit or minimum sell limits for the orders
    and will not be executed till the conditions are met.CHAPTER 20 T Terra Terra
    is a Blockchain platform containing many stable coins that are pegged to different
    fiat currencies. Collateral for stable coins is provided by Luna coin. It supports
    Oracle system and smart contracts with a plan for mass user adoption. Luna and
    Terra are traded on Binance, Huobi and other exchanges. Test Net A second blockchain
    network other than live network, used by developers for testing new versions of
    client software without putting a real value at risk. Bitcoin has testnets like
    Bitcoin Testnet, Ethereum has Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby and Hyperledger has Umbra. Testnet
    Kovan Kovan refers to an Ethereum Testnet that supports parity clients and uses
    Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus. It is the first PoA testnet issued by Ethcore
    after Ropsten attacks. Testnet Rinkeby It refers to an Ethereum Testnet that supports
    Geth clients and uses Proof of Authority consensus. Testnet Ropsten It refers
    to an Ethereum Testnet that supports both tGeth and Parity clients and uses Proof
    of Authority consensus. It is mostly similar to mainnet. Refer Ropsten in Section
    R for additional details. Tether Tether is a controversial stablecoin cryptocurrency
    with tokens issued by Tether Limited. It formerly falsely claimed that each token
    was backed by one United States dollar, but on 14 March 2019 changed the backing
    to include loans to affiliate companies. Theta The Theta blockchain is the only
    end-to-end infrastructure for decentralized video streaming and delivery that
    provides both technical and economic solutions. It is based on Multi BFT Consensus,
    Signature Gossip scheme and supports Micropayments. Investors include Sony, Samsung
    and others. Timothy May Timothy C. May, better known as Tim May was an American
    technical, political writer, electronic engineer and senior scientist at Intel.
    He coined the term Cryptoanarchy where government is not only redundant but also
    irrelevant. His cryptoanarchy movement has led to the emergence of Cypherpunks
    such as David Chaum, Wei Dai and others who programmed cryptocurrencies and eventually
    laid foundation for birth of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Blockchain. To
    the Moon “To the Moon” is an exclamation used when cryptocurrency prices are rising
    off the charts. By the same token, when a coin’s price is “mooning,” that means
    that the price has hit a peak. Related information: Bitmex a crypto exchange has
    partnered with Astrobotic a space robotic company to place Bitcoin on the moon
    through a lunar mission. Token A token is the digital representation of an asset
    built over existing blockchain. They are designed for uniqueness, instant transferability,
    liquidity, digital scarcity, and security. There are over 10,000 different types
    of tokens traded in over 380 exchanges globally. TPS (Transaction per second) An
    input or addition into a blockchain network that can make some changes in the
    existing blockchain data is known as a transaction. Number of such transactions
    that can be accommodated per second is TPS which determines the speed of Blockchain.
    Bitcoin has TPS of 7, Ethereum has 25, Litecoin has 56, Cardano has 250, ICON
    has 9000\. Transaction Block Transaction block refers to a collection of transactions
    on the blockchain that can be hashed and submitted to the blockchain. They are
    like digital files to store and record transactions. Transaction Fees The work
    of validating transactions and adding them to the Blockchain is performed by miners
    or validators. Miners use powerful computers to confirm the transactions as well
    as maintain Blockchain network. For doing this, they are rewarded with fees called
    as transaction fees for every transaction that is confirmed and included in the
    block. These transactions fees are over and above the block reward they get for
    adding every block to the Blockchain network. Usually miners, prioritize validation
    of transactions that carry higher fees. Trilemma Refers to scalability dilemma
    that crypto projects must address while designing underlying architecture and
    optimizing it. They pertain to scalability aspects like speed and volume of transactions,
    distribution of network nodes & preventing integrity of network from compromise. Troll
    Box It is a Social Application created for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to easily
    communicate. Exists on exchanges like BTC-E and Poloniex. Trolls on Troll Box
    help in providing censor free, relevant, accurate and timely news to help members
    make better trading decisions. Trustless The Internet created a global infrastructure
    for cheap and flexible communication and depends on a recognized authority or
    intermediary to promote trust. A global information system that has the properties
    of Internet and also the functionality to provide authentic statements without
    a trusted intermediary is required and such a system is called trustless. Blockchain
    enables trustless computing. Turing Test Devised by Alan Turing in 1950, originally
    referred to as an imitation game, evaluates a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligence
    and behavior equal to humans. A machine will be involved in conversation with
    humans and evaluator and if evaluator is not able to differentiate machine from
    humans, machine is said to have passed the test. Test results are based on how
    close the machine will provide answers compared to that of humans and not necessarily
    correct answers. Turing Completeness A machine is considered to be Turing complete
    if it can perform any calculation that any other programmable computer is capable
    of. All modern computers are Turing-complete in this sense. The Ethereum Virtual
    Machine (EVM) which runs on the Ethereum blockchain is Turing complete. Thus,
    it can process any “computable function”. It is, in short, able to do what you
    could do with any conventional computer and programming language. Tokenization Tokenization
    is a process that allows the translation of business goods, strategies, or services
    into discrete units that are tradable and can be recorded on a blockchain. They
    help in increasing the liquidity of underlying assets and promotes unlocking of
    value. Tokenomics Supply and demand characteristics of cryptocurrencies represent
    Tokenomics. It is based on the idea of token economy proposed first by Harvard
    psychologist BF Skinner in 1972\. He believed it could control behavior and incentivize
    positive actions by giving some unit of recognizable value. It also studies how
    cryptocurrencies work in the broader ecosystem covering token distribution and
    how incentives foster positive behavior in the network. Tendermint A Blockchain
    application and leading Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) engine for building blockchains,
    particularly the Cosmos Ecosystem. Supports Tendermint Core and Gaia. Tendermint
    core provides web server, database and supporting libraries for all blockchain
    applications regardless of their programming language. Tezos Tezos is an open
    source Blockchain network based on Proof of Stake, that facilitates peer-to-peer
    transactions and smart contracts with TEZ as native currency. Tezos smart contracts
    use formal verification, allowing them to be mathematically verifiable. Truffle TVL
    (Total value locked) TVL in the DeFi world means the amount of money that a single
    Decentralized Exchange (DEX), Decentralized App (dApp) or the entire ecosystem
    is holding inside it. Curve Finance, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Bancor and Balancer are
    some of the leading DEXs based on their respective TVL.CHAPTER 21 U Ubuntu Ubuntu
    is a Linux distribution created on October, 2004 by Mark Shuttleworth. It is based
    on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software to address fragmentations
    that existed in Linux with various unsupported community editions. It is compatible
    with many of Ethereum’s development tools. Ubuntu is a complete Linux operating
    system, freely available with both community and professional support. In fact,
    it is known as world’s first free software and also the first operating system
    that had scheduled releases in predictable intervals and cadence. Ubuntu Desktop
    is also the world’s most widely used Linux workstation platform. Ubuntu Server
    is the reference operating system for the Openstack project and popular OS on
    AWS, Google and Azure. Uncle Blocks Uncle blocks are similar to Bitcoin Orphan
    blocks; they are created in Ethereum blockchains when two blocks are mined and
    submitted to the ledger at roughly the same time. Only one can enter the ledger
    as a block, and the other cannot as it has relatively lower share of proof of
    work. Miners are rewarded for uncle blocks in the Ethereum system unlike for orphan
    blocks in Bitcoin. Uniswap Uniswap is the most popular Ethereum based DEX and
    a decentralized finance protocol that is used to exchange cryptocurrencies. The
    protocol facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the
    Ethereum blockchain through the use of smart contracts and Automated Market Maker
    (AMM) model. Developed by Hayden Adams in 201using Solidity. Unlinkability It
    helps in providing anonymity in Public Blockchains. In Bitcoin, unlikability occurs
    when it becomes difficult to link multiple addresses and transactions belonging
    to the same user. USD Coin USD Coin (USDC) is a digital stable coin that is pegged
    to the United States dollar and runs on Ethereum, Stellar and Algorand blockchains.
    Each USDC is backed by a dollar held in reserve. USD Coin is managed by a consortium
    called Centre. It is founded by Circle, a company that helps internet businesses
    accept payments and make payments in one unified platform UTXO (Unspent Transaction
    Output) A UTXO defines an output of a blockchain transaction that has not been
    spent, i.e. can be used as an input in a new transaction. In other words, it can
    be defined as the amount of digital currency remaining after a cryptocurrency
    transaction is executed. It helps in preventing double spending in a simple manner
    without the need for scanning entire Blockchain. Bitcoin uses the UTXO model to
    prevent double counting and spending. UTXO is based on Hal Finney’s reusable Proofs
    of Work proposal, that in turn was based on Adam Back’s Hashcash proposal. UBIN
    (Project UBIN) Project Ubin is a collaborative project with the industry to explore
    the use of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for clearing and
    settlement of payments and securities. This project aims to help MAS (Monetary
    Authority of Singapore) and the industry to better understand DLT and potential
    benefits it may bring through practical experimentation and broad ecosystem collaboration
    in Tokenised Singapore Dollar, Rewiring Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) based
    money transfers, Delivery vs Payment (DvP) and Cross Border Payments. Ursa Hyperledger
    Ursa is a shared cryptographic library that prevents the replication of cryptographic
    work, thereby increasing the overall security of the Blockchain network. The two
    primary components of Ursa are the Base-Crypto library and Z-Mix. Its library
    serves as a repository for both Hyperledger and Non Hyperledger projects to use
    crypto.CHAPTER 22 V Validator A Validator is the one who verifies all incoming
    transactions on a Blockchain and signs such verified transactions with their Private
    keys. Vaporware It is a product, typically computer hardware or software, that
    is announced early to general public but its launch is either delayed or never
    manufactured or officially cancelled. In Blockchain, it refers to a cryptocurrency
    project that has never become a reality or launched on account of no proper use
    case or technology to support promises or claims of the project. Tron and Verge,
    during their initial days, were considered as Vaporware in crypto world. VeChainThor The
    VeChainThor is a Public Blockchain, conceptualized in 2015 by Sunny Lu and launched
    in 2016\. It is designed for mass adoption of blockchain technology by enterprise
    users for enhancing Supply Chain visibility, carbon credits and anti-counterfeiting
    services. It offers digitally verifiable provenance to Supply Chains. It hosts
    VeChain ecosystem that uses physical tracking devices to track every stage in
    Supply chain. Powered by VeChain (VET) token and VeThor tokens (VTHO), VET is
    used for storage and transfer of value and VTHO is used as an energy token (gas)
    to pay for transactions on the network. VIPER (Viper Protocol) Viper Protocol
    is a cross-chain and multi-product DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocol based
    on Harmony Blockchain. VIPER is the native governance and revenue generating token
    that is used for Governance of Viper Exchange/DEX and all DeFi products operating
    on Harmony blockchain. It is also compatible with Binance Smart Chain, Fantom
    and others. VMAC (vMessage Authentication Code) VMAC is a block cipher-based message
    authentication code (MAC) algorithm that uses a universal hash proposed by Ted
    Krovetz and Wei Dai in April 2007\. The algorithm was designed for high performance
    on 64 bit systems, backed by a formal analysis. Vyper Vyper is a contract-oriented,
    pythonic programming language used to write smart contracts. It was created by
    Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood. It has less features than Solidity but makes contracts
    more secure and easier to audit. It succeeded Serpent that was originally developed
    for Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin Vitalik Buterin is the Co-founder and creator of
    Ethereum. He was initiated into the world of Cryptocurrencies as Co-Founder of
    Bitcoin Magazine in 2011\. He launched Ethereum with Gavin Wood in 2014\. He is
    also known for his philanthropy and donated over USD 1.5 billion worth of cryptos
    to various institutions and foundations.CHAPTER 23 W W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) Founded
    in 1994 and led by Tim Berners Lee, who invented World Wide Web, W3C is working
    on developing standards for World Wide Web. These Open Standards are accessible
    to all so that Web can function as One Web and drive innovation for Humanity.
    W3C works on design principles that promote 1\. Web for All (benefits available
    to all regardless of hardware, software, native language, physical or mental ability)
    and 2\. Web on Everything (Web being accessed by mobile phones, smart phones,
    kiosks, interactive voice response systems and others). Wallet A wallet is an
    app that allows cryptocurrency users to store and retrieve their digital assets.
    The five main types of cryptocurrency wallets include mobile, desktop, paper,
    hardware, online and mobile wallets. Web3.js It refers to collection of libraries
    that allow users to interact with local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, WebSocket
    protocols or JSON Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Created by Ethereum Foundation,
    it facilitates retrieving user accounts, sending transactions and interacting
    with smart contracts. Web of Trust A web of trust is a concept used in PGP (Pretty
    Good Privacy). Initially a concept created by Phil Zimmerman, GnuPG (GNU Privacy
    Guard), and other OpenPGP-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of
    binding between a public key and its owner. It uses trust model in a decentralized
    way and is positioned as good alternative to centralized trust model of Public
    Key Infrastructure (PKI) that is dependent on Central Authority. Web3 Web3 can
    be mentioned as a revolution of Internet Backend while Web2 was a front-end revolution.
    It is a set of protocols led by blockchain, that intends to reinvent how Internet
    is wired in the backend, combining the logic of Internet with the logic of the
    computer. It empowers users to control their data and also create a native settlement
    layer. It brings in a right to forget and delete on the Internet. Wei Dai Wei
    Dai is a computer engineer and famous cypherpunk known for contributions to cryptography
    and cryptocurrencies. He was a programmer at Terra Sciences and part of Cryptocurrency
    Research Group at Microsoft. He developed the Crypto++ cryptographic library,
    created the b-money cryptocurrency system, and co-proposed the VMAC message authentication
    algorithm. He also contributed to SSH2 vulnerability discovery by identifying
    loopholes in Encryption Block Chaining. Wei Wei is the smallest denomination of
    ether, the cryptocurrency coin used on the Ethereum network. One wei is one quintillionth
    of an ether. Wei is named after the Computer Engineer Wei Dai who is known for
    his contributions to the world of Cryptography and Cryptocurrencies. Whale Whale
    refers to individuals or entities that hold large amounts of bitcoin. With their
    large cryptocurrency holdings, they have the potential to manipulate currency
    prices and valuations. Barry Silbert, Tim Draper, Michael Novogratz, Tyler & Cameron
    Winklevoss are some well-known Bitcoin whales When Lambo It’s a slang that is
    used to represent a crytpocurrency’s success. When a new crypto-coin or token
    is launched, this question ‘When Lambo’ is asked to denote the time at which the
    coin’s price will be worthy enough to buy the car Lamborghini. Whisper Whisper
    is a part of the Ethereum P2P protocol suite that allows for messaging between
    users via the same network that the blockchain runs on. It is a pure identity-based
    messaging system which provides a simple low-level API without being based upon
    or influenced by the low-level hardware attributes and characteristics. World
    State World State is a key-value store which is updated as a result of transactions
    and chaincode execution. It is a component of Hyperledger Fabric Ledger. It represents
    the latest values for all keys included in the chain transaction log. The world
    state will change every time the value of a key changes. Wrapped Bitcoin Wrapped
    Bitcoin (WBTC) is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin (BTC) on Ethereum blockchain.
    Integration into the world of Ethereum wallets, dapps, and smart contracts is
    facilitated by WBTC. In essence, Wrapped Bitcoin allows Bitcoin holders to tokenize
    their coins on Ethereum and they are matched by equal number of WBTC tokens. Wrapped
    Coins They represent tokenized version of other cryptocurrencies and address limitations
    pertaining to interoperability between two different Blockchains. Wrapped coins
    exist on Blockchains that were not used to issue them initially. Eg: Wrapped Bitcoin
    and Wrapped Ether. Wrapped coins help in increasing liquidity of centralized and
    decentralized exchanges. WASM (Web Assembly) Web Assembly is a binary instruction
    format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation
    target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and
    server applications.CHAPTER 24 X XRP XRP is a digital asset built for payments
    by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz. It is the native digital asset
    on the XRP (Ripple) Ledger. Ripple began selling XRP in 2012\. Its intent was
    to allow financial institutions to transfer money with negligible fees and wait
    time. Always positioned as a replacement for SWIFT by removing the settlement
    layer between major financial institutions.CHAPTER 25 Y YAC (Yet Another Consensus) It’s
    a novel and viable Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm based
    on modular architecture and simple implementation basis called Yet Another Consensus.
    It has been implemented in Hyperledger Iroha Blockchain platform and has helped
    in achieving low latency and a very high transaction throughput for transactions. YAML
    (Yet Another Markup Language) YAML, first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001, is
    a Markup and Data serialization language that came into existence in 2001\. YAML
    is an alternative to JSON that formats data in a natural, easy to read and concise
    manner. Its not a programming language in the true sense. YAML files store information
    anddoesn’t include actions and decisions. It was released in an era that had proliferation
    of various mark-up languages like HTML, XML and SGML. Later, YAML was recoined
    as YAML Aint Markup Language. Yield Farming Any effort to deploy crypto assets
    to generate maximum returns through them is called Yield Farming. It opens up
    new price arbitrages and also involves lending crypto assets or holdings through
    DeFi protocols to earn fixed or variable returns. YFI (Yearn Finance) It is a
    gateway to a range of yield generating products in the Ethereum ecosystem. It
    interfaces with all of DeFi investment avenues like lending aggregation, yield
    generation and insurance. Ithas a native coin called as YFI coin.CHAPTER 26 Z ZCash Zcash
    is the first crypto currency in the world to use Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) through
    zk SNARKS and provide enhanced privacy to its users. It doesn’t make every transaction
    detail public, which is the case with most of other cryptocurrencies. Zcash is
    based on Bitcoin’s codebase. In 2013, Matthew Green, Ian Miers and Christina Garman
    from Johns Hopkins University came up with Zerocoin, a proposed privacy extension
    to Bitcoin. Alessandro Chiesa, Eli Ben Sasson, Eram Tromer & Madars Virza joined
    the founding team later. The Zero Coin Electronic Company was formed in 2015 to
    work on and deliver proposed privacy extensions. Zcash Foundation was launched
    in 2017\. ZCash shares many similarities with Bitcoin such as a fixed total supply
    of 21 million units. Zeppelin Founded in 2015 by Demian Brener and Manuel Aaroz,
    Zeppelin is a new smart contract development framework through Open Zeppelin for
    the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that is focused on security, modularity, and
    code reusability. Zero Confirmation Transaction Zero confirmation transaction
    is a transaction which occurs but is not yet confirmed by the miners. This means
    the transaction that has not yet been recorded and verified on the blockchain.
    The first confirmation comes when a block records the data. ZK Snark (Zero-knowledge
    succinct non-interactive argument of A zk-SNARK is a cryptographic proof that
    allows one party to prove it possesses certain information without revealing that
    information. It was introduced by Bitansky et al. This proof is made possible
    using a secret key created before the transaction takes place. “Succinct” zero-knowledge
    proofs can be verified within a few milliseconds, with a proof length of only
    a few hundred bytes even for programs that are very large. Zcash is the first
    cryptocurrency in the world to use ZK Snark to encrypt the transactions. Till
    2021, 82 cryptocurrencies have adopted Zero Knowledge Proof or other private technology
    to encrypt transactions. ZK-STARK (Zero-knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument
    of Knowledge) Created by Eli Ben Sasson, these are quantum proof unlike ZK-SNARK.
    They are more scalable in terms of compute speed and size and do not need an initial
    trusted set up as they use collision resistant hash functions. ZKP (Zero knowledge
    proof in cryptography) Zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method
    by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that
    they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that
    they know the value x. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial
    to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing
    it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information
    itself or any additional information. In simple terms, it helps in maintaining
    privacy in a data-based world. A zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties:  Completeness:
    A honest prover will always be able to prove correctness of a true statement. Soundness:
    A cheater can never prove a false statement to be correct to an honest verifier. Zero-knowledge:
    If the statement is true, no verifier learns anything other than the fact that
    the statement is true. For example, a citizen above the age of 18 and wanting
    to prove this fact to a verifier, will be able to prove the truth about his/her
    age without revealing his actual date of birth or the actual age. Fundamentals
    of ZKP are explained through the well-known tale – The Ali Baba Cave and ZKP written
    by Jean Jacques Quisquater in his paper titled - “How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
    Protocols to Your Children”CHAPTER 27 Others 51% attacks A 51% attack refers to
    an attack on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain where an attacker or a group of
    attackers gain control of 51% or more of the computing power or hash rate. Attackers
    use 51% attacks to reverse transactions that have already taken place in a blockchain,
    in what has come to be known as double spend. Krypton and Shift Blockchains that
    are based on Ethereum, have suffered 51% attacks. $Whale $WHALE is a social currency
    launched in May, 2020 as ERC 20 token. It is backed by tangible and rare NFT assets,
    while promoting scarcity through limited issuance and driving values thereby.
    It has a maximum supply of 10 million coins. It value proposition is based on
    1\. The Vault, 2\. Strong Brand, 3\. Community, 4\. Tokenomics, 5\. Leadership
    and 6\. Vault storing digital art and collectiblesIndex Symbols 51% attack 157$WHALE
