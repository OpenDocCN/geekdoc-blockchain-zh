    and considerations for building new computer architectures to support the emerging
    consumer market. Many of us believe that the advent of 5G will be a major technical
    development that will dramatically accelerate the way businesses and individuals
    use and depend on digital technologies. The book has integrated two essential
    challenges to designing and developing these new systems: the technical components
    that comprise the physical machines and devices; and the various approaches to
    migrating the vast number of legacy systems that run the day-to-day organizations
    throughout the world.'

  zh: 本书的目的是为读者提供一份关于构建新的计算机架构以支持新兴消费市场的过程和考虑事项的路线图。我们许多人认为，5G的出现将是一个重大的技术发展，它将大大加速企业和个人使用和依赖数字技术的方式。本书已经整合了设计和开发这些新系统所面临的两个基本挑战：构成物理机器和设备的技术组件；以及迁移全球日常运营的大量遗留系统的各种方法。
- en: The legacy challenge seems overwhelming and I believe that many organizations
    will fail to understand the urgency of why they need to move quickly to digital.
    They likely will fail to embrace 5G and IoT timely and as a result I expect further
    business failures in the future. Indeed, it seems every few months another business
    giant announces performance shortfalls. I mentioned in Chap. [6](480347_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml)
    the GE Digital division underperformance. The results of this failure have devastated
    GE’s market cap and for the first time they have fallen from the Dow 500, the
    last of the original companies that started on the Index! There are others, most
    recently Toy-R-Us, which seemed to have a good private equity partner but could
    not get its organization to embrace a digital culture fast enough. Although expectations
    were positive, they inevitably closed. I also expect many other businesses to
    consider merging especially in the higher education marketplace where we have
    already seen 20 college closures as online education begins to make an impact
    on what was once thought of as an untouchable business. Another critical dilemma
    is the reality of the required investment that is needed to transform to digital.
    I expect the costs to be substantial and I predict that many companies may need
    to raise cash from private equity partners to appropriately move into the digital
    age.

- en: This model understood that the consumerization of technology established the
    requirements for organizations to develop “flexible and resilient business processes
    and focused analytics” (p. 6). The key of this need, according to the authors,
    are based on two key “pillars” defined as N = 1 and R = G. It means that every
    business must serve each consumer as a unique individual (N = 1). R = G, states
    that resources must be global in order to accomplish N = 1\. So the House of Innovation
    defines consumerization of IT based on an organization’s ability to satisfy a
    customer’s needs by providing global service offerings. Therefore, to successfully
    compete in the digital world businesses must provide agile services 24/7 365 to
    their consumers! So, if a consumer needs service at off-peak times, organizations
    will likely need to provide support using global resources to survive. For example,
    a consumer needing support at midnight in New York might by serviced by someone
    in India—it’s an ‘‘on-demand,’’ model that can be compared to the Burger King
    slogan, ‘‘have it your way!’’ The point is that consumers want it on demand. So,
    Burger King would have to provide hamburgers at midnight and offer an unlimited
    number of choices. Not an easy challenge, but this is the reality of what consumerization
    of technology means. My message is the need to treat every consumer as a unique
    person and to deliver services seamlessly. To accomplish this objective, the analyst
    needs to provide software to support agility—the type of agility that is now available
    because of 5G speed, IoT devices, and blockchain architecture. This book has also
    advocated the expansion of the analyst’s role to help manage the cultural shift
    necessary to become a digital company. Indeed, a digital entity needs to assimilate
    new types of employees that can integrate with the legacy staff. Snow et al. ([2017](#CR6))
    posited that digital organizations were necessary to support the new technologies
    and that such organizations needed to be designed for self-authorization rather
    than the traditional hierarchical methods that project control and coordination.
    They concluded that successful organizations need workplaces that parallel digital
    uncertainties and recommend structures that are “highly engaged and productive”
    (p. 11).

  zh: 这个模型认识到,技术的消费化确立了组织需要开发"灵活且有弹性的业务流程和集中的分析"(第6页)的要求。根据作者的说法,这一需求的关键建立在两个"支柱"之上,即
    N = 1 和 R = G。这意味着每个企业都必须以独特的个体(N = 1)来服务每一位消费者。 R = G 表示,资源必须是全球性的,以实现 N = 1。因此,创新之家定义了基于组织满足客户需求的全球服务供给能力的IT消费化。因此,要在数字世界中成功竞争,企业必须全天候365天提供敏捷的服务!
    所以,如果消费者在非高峰时段需要服务,组织很可能需要利用全球资源提供支持才能生存。例如,在凌晨1点需要支持的纽约消费者,可能会得到印度员工的服务——这是一种"按需"模式,可以与汉堡王的广告语"你说怎样,我们就怎样!"相提并论。关键在于,消费者需求是即时的。因此,汉堡王必须提供午夜汉堡,并提供无限的选择。这是一个艰巨的挑战,但这就是技术消费化的现实。我的信息是,需要将每个消费者视为独特的个体,并无缝地提供服务。为了实现这一目标,分析师需要提供支持敏捷性的软件——这种敏捷性现在由于5G速度、物联网设备和区块链架构而可用。这本书还主张,分析师的角色应该得到扩展,以帮助管理向数字公司转型所必需的文化转变。事实上,数字实体需要吸收新类型的员工,与现有员工融为一体。Snow
    等人([2017](#CR6)) 认为,需要数字组织来支持新技术,这种组织需要设计为自主授权,而不是传统的等级制和项目控制及协调。他们得出结论,成功的组织需要与数字不确定性并行的工作场所,并推荐"高度参与和高效"(第11页)的结构。

    How can we architect applications and networks that can scale and deal with this
    uncertainty? It was Accenture in 2012 who first published the report, “Reimagining
    Enterprise IT for an Uncertain Future” that emphasized the inability to do traditional
    planning because of the rise of data-driven decision-making for critical systems
    design. The report also called for new approaches to innovation; the rethinking
    of how to design new products and services that could be delivered to the consumer
    at lower costs. Bradley and Nolan brilliantly published their book in 1998 “Sense
    and Respond” and predicted the shifts in consumer behavior that became a reality
    20 years later. They posited that organizations needed to sense opportunities
    and respond with strategies as opposed attempting to predict the future using

- en: Today we see the theory of quantum physics being mapped to computing systems.
    The hope is that new architectures will be able to utilize resources differently
    in each instance as opposed to the way a binary system does sequential calculations.
    This means that applications may be able to do complex calculations incredibly
    faster. This will provide the backbone systems to support a whole new transition
    of human behavior—behavior that changes how we function in a digital-driven world.
    So, what do we do with the notion of budgets, and how far forward can we really
    budget the future? In other parts of my work I have emphasized that all budgets
    need to be adjustable during the year, and multi-year budgets appear to be an
    exercise of false hopes. The larger challenge is to somehow marry human behavior
    with systems architecture. I discussed this idea in the book referencing, The
    Inversion Factor (2017), which suggested the importance of the shift from product
    to function. Cusumano et al. ([2019](#CR1)) present the concept of a business
    as a platform. They define platforms as bringing “together individuals and organizations
    so they can innovate or interact in ways not otherwise possible, with the potential
    for nonlinear increases in utility and value” (p. 13). Simply put, the better
    platform will beat the best product.

    the larger impact over the next decade. In 2017 Deloitte surveyed 250 people that
    they deemed competent cognitive managers and found that 58% of them were already
    utilizing ML in their business practices. I have no doubt, as I have advocated
    in this book, that IoT will serve to accelerate higher percentages of ML use globally.

    a physical perspective. But nothing really can operate safely without a more security
    focused processor. While blockchain is still in its infancy, it remains our best
    option. All of the criticisms are real, especially as it relates to latency. I
    predict a plethora of new blockchain products in the market, likely all to be
    very specialized within a particular industry. Without doubt we will see new blockchain
    products offered by third-party vendors that will integrate legacy systems similar
    to the way we combined object and relational databases. Further, vendors will
    develop applications that will link their cloud products with existing legacy
    applications and offer software migration products. I expect this integration
    and migration to be at the forefront for CIOs over the next 15 years. Most concerning
    is the future of the mainframe, which never seems to meet its s-curve end. The
    good news is that it remains one of the most secure systems, the bad is that there
    are diminishing staff available. Mainframes are also very expensive to operate
