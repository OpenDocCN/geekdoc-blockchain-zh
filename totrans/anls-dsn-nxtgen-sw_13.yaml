    and considerations for building new computer architectures to support the emerging
    consumer market. Many of us believe that the advent of 5G will be a major technical
    development that will dramatically accelerate the way businesses and individuals
    use and depend on digital technologies. The book has integrated two essential
    challenges to designing and developing these new systems: the technical components
    that comprise the physical machines and devices; and the various approaches to
    migrating the vast number of legacy systems that run the day-to-day organizations
    throughout the world.'

    will fail to understand the urgency of why they need to move quickly to digital.
    They likely will fail to embrace 5G and IoT timely and as a result I expect further
    business failures in the future. Indeed, it seems every few months another business
    giant announces performance shortfalls. I mentioned in Chap. [6](480347_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml)
    the GE Digital division underperformance. The results of this failure have devastated
    GE’s market cap and for the first time they have fallen from the Dow 500, the
    last of the original companies that started on the Index! There are others, most
    recently Toy-R-Us, which seemed to have a good private equity partner but could
    not get its organization to embrace a digital culture fast enough. Although expectations
    were positive, they inevitably closed. I also expect many other businesses to
    consider merging especially in the higher education marketplace where we have
    already seen 20 college closures as online education begins to make an impact
    on what was once thought of as an untouchable business. Another critical dilemma
    is the reality of the required investment that is needed to transform to digital.
    I expect the costs to be substantial and I predict that many companies may need
    to raise cash from private equity partners to appropriately move into the digital
    age.

    culture. It’s one thing to have the technology infrastructure, it’s another to
    have the right people. We see many companies struggling to find the appropriate
    technical talent, and even more cannot get their existing staffs to embrace digital.
    Prahalad and Krishnan ([2008](#CR5)) foresaw this development over 10 years ago
    when they created the “New House of Innovation” shown in Fig. [13.1](#Fig1).![../images/480347_1_En_13_Chapter/480347_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/480347_1_En_13_Chapter/480347_1_En_13_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: This model understood that the consumerization of technology established the
    requirements for organizations to develop “flexible and resilient business processes
    and focused analytics” (p. 6). The key of this need, according to the authors,
    are based on two key “pillars” defined as N = 1 and R = G. It means that every
    business must serve each consumer as a unique individual (N = 1). R = G, states
    that resources must be global in order to accomplish N = 1\. So the House of Innovation
    defines consumerization of IT based on an organization’s ability to satisfy a
    customer’s needs by providing global service offerings. Therefore, to successfully
    compete in the digital world businesses must provide agile services 24/7 365 to
    their consumers! So, if a consumer needs service at off-peak times, organizations
    will likely need to provide support using global resources to survive. For example,
    a consumer needing support at midnight in New York might by serviced by someone
    in India—it’s an ‘‘on-demand,’’ model that can be compared to the Burger King
    slogan, ‘‘have it your way!’’ The point is that consumers want it on demand. So,
    Burger King would have to provide hamburgers at midnight and offer an unlimited
    number of choices. Not an easy challenge, but this is the reality of what consumerization
    of technology means. My message is the need to treat every consumer as a unique
    person and to deliver services seamlessly. To accomplish this objective, the analyst
    needs to provide software to support agility—the type of agility that is now available
    because of 5G speed, IoT devices, and blockchain architecture. This book has also
    advocated the expansion of the analyst’s role to help manage the cultural shift
    necessary to become a digital company. Indeed, a digital entity needs to assimilate
    new types of employees that can integrate with the legacy staff. Snow et al. ([2017](#CR6))
    posited that digital organizations were necessary to support the new technologies
    and that such organizations needed to be designed for self-authorization rather
    than the traditional hierarchical methods that project control and coordination.
    They concluded that successful organizations need workplaces that parallel digital
    uncertainties and recommend structures that are “highly engaged and productive”
    (p. 11).

    How can we architect applications and networks that can scale and deal with this
    uncertainty? It was Accenture in 2012 who first published the report, “Reimagining
    Enterprise IT for an Uncertain Future” that emphasized the inability to do traditional
    planning because of the rise of data-driven decision-making for critical systems
    design. The report also called for new approaches to innovation; the rethinking
    of how to design new products and services that could be delivered to the consumer
    at lower costs. Bradley and Nolan brilliantly published their book in 1998 “Sense
    and Respond” and predicted the shifts in consumer behavior that became a reality
    20 years later. They posited that organizations needed to sense opportunities
    and respond with strategies as opposed attempting to predict the future using
    budgets.

- en: Today we see the theory of quantum physics being mapped to computing systems.
    The hope is that new architectures will be able to utilize resources differently
    in each instance as opposed to the way a binary system does sequential calculations.
    This means that applications may be able to do complex calculations incredibly
    faster. This will provide the backbone systems to support a whole new transition
    of human behavior—behavior that changes how we function in a digital-driven world.
    So, what do we do with the notion of budgets, and how far forward can we really
    budget the future? In other parts of my work I have emphasized that all budgets
    need to be adjustable during the year, and multi-year budgets appear to be an
    exercise of false hopes. The larger challenge is to somehow marry human behavior
    with systems architecture. I discussed this idea in the book referencing, The
    Inversion Factor (2017), which suggested the importance of the shift from product
    to function. Cusumano et al. ([2019](#CR1)) present the concept of a business
    as a platform. They define platforms as bringing “together individuals and organizations
    so they can innovate or interact in ways not otherwise possible, with the potential
    for nonlinear increases in utility and value” (p. 13). Simply put, the better
    platform will beat the best product.

    run AI will provide evolutionary benefits; in the long run, it is likely to be
    revolutionary (p. 7). Ultimately, I believe that applications will be easier to
    use and will support better decision making. ML, on the other hand, will make
    the larger impact over the next decade. In 2017 Deloitte surveyed 250 people that
    they deemed competent cognitive managers and found that 58% of them were already
    utilizing ML in their business practices. I have no doubt, as I have advocated
    in this book, that IoT will serve to accelerate higher percentages of ML use globally.
    The reasons are quite simple, the physical mind can no longer handle the size
    of datasets that will be accumulated by collection devices. Humans will have to
    rely more on intelligent machines to give them results.

    who see opportunities early in the marketplace. As such, the traditional firms
    are laggards as it takes them more time to get over the risk factors, a sort of
    watch and wait syndrome, and then begin to think about ways to transform their
    enterprises. Such is the same with digital disruption, as we see a slow adoption
    of AI and ML in most organizations. Unlike historical revolutions, this concerns
    me because of the acceleration of change produced by new technologies. Being a
    laggard during this period could ensure failure. The reader should recall the
    concept of a shrinking s-curve that requires organizations to act quicker if they
    are to compete in a global economy that is being swamped by new startups every

    not your products or competitors” (p. 17). The analyst must be a key operator
    in this effort. Although there is no question that c-level executives must initiative
    the effort and formulate the strategies, the management and implementation of
    these efforts are far more critical to overall adoption. Success cannot be attained
    without having individuals that have a core understanding of computer architecture,

    next generation of technology. 5G is the initiator, and IoT the aggregator from
    a physical perspective. But nothing really can operate safely without a more security
    focused processor. While blockchain is still in its infancy, it remains our best
    option. All of the criticisms are real, especially as it relates to latency. I
    predict a plethora of new blockchain products in the market, likely all to be
    very specialized within a particular industry. Without doubt we will see new blockchain
    products offered by third-party vendors that will integrate legacy systems similar
    to the way we combined object and relational databases. Further, vendors will
    develop applications that will link their cloud products with existing legacy
    applications and offer software migration products. I expect this integration
    and migration to be at the forefront for CIOs over the next 15 years. Most concerning
    is the future of the mainframe, which never seems to meet its s-curve end. The
    good news is that it remains one of the most secure systems, the bad is that there
    are diminishing staff available. Mainframes are also very expensive to operate
    and require large facilities. The bottom line is that companies who rely on mainframe
    processing need to consider an alternative hardware platform if they are to remain
    competitive.

    data repository. The two must interact in a very complex way. Indeed, blockchain
    architecture wants to replicate data and store it, and cloud wants to somehow
    still maintain central control. On the other hand, cloud also represents some
    combination of the two since we can execute applications from the cloud in addition
    to data storage. So, what cloud really does is to provide a more cost-effective
    way to expand applications across the internet. I have covered many cloud models
    and choices, all of which have advantages and disadvantages, but inevitably cloud
    will mature into a major hosting facility that allows global businesses to thrive
    throughout the world, assuming that of course that security can be assured.

    are available but too slow to implement. That is, software has outpaced the evolution

    increase processing speed. Unfortunately, quantum is not yet available or feasible.

- en: Let’s examine these three issues further. When speaking with senior managers,
    analysts need to relate to business objectives and avoid too much technical jargon.
    Analysts also need to explain how third-party vendors will be managed to ensure
    that there are proper controls over security exposure. Analysts should also apply
    benchmarks of what competitors are doing to convince their managers to adhere
    to best security design practices. Peer pressure is often an effective practice
    to push change.

    with poor internal staff practices. Indeed, many compromises have been linked
    to careless work behaviors of staff. Analysts should consider discussing additional
    security steps in the SDLC. Such steps should include documentation of how security
    considerations have been addressed during analysis and design. Analysts need;
    however, to ensure that the security implications are weighed against its effects
    on business operations and competitive advantage.

    the need for a new generation of computer architecture. The chapters integrated
    the technical design ramifications of building these new architectures and ways
    to transition existing legacy systems. I have also advocated that the digital
    era will require major changes in organization design including new roles and
    responsibilities. Most important I have defined the expanding role for those professionals
    that will be engaged in the actual analysis, design, and management of these new
    systems. Figure [13.2](#Fig2) provides a diagram of the complex functions that
    need to be performed by managers and analysts.![../images/480347_1_En_13_Chapter/480347_1_En_13_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/480347_1_En_13_Chapter/480347_1_En_13_Fig2_HTML.png)

    take on all of these duties. I believe these new responsibilities will result
    in the creation of a new organization focused on all of these aspects. I have
    referred to these staff members as “analysts” throughout the book. Whether this
    is their inevitable title, I believe the existing business and systems analysts
    are the likely individuals to take on these roles and to build the new organization.
    Ultimately the name of the position is less important than having the staff that
    can carry out the necessary requirements to build and support these new mobile
    systems. I think it is essential that organizations give high priority to these
    functions in order to successfully transition their firms to meet the demands
    of tomorrow’s consumers.
