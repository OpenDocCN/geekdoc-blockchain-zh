- en: I was vomiting into a tree stump.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vomiting is never fun, especially on a weekday. This tree stump was right next
    to the driveway, and that definitely made it less fun, since Martin’s neighbors
    were probably watching.

- en: I had been driving to meet with my adviser, when I got the call from our bank
    client.
  prefs: []

- en: “Sooyoung, hi.” I put her on my wireless headset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “John, where is our contract?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Sorry?” Talking with Sooyoung was like catching dinner plates. “You’re looking
    for our contract?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yeah. I need to end the relationship.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My stomach roiled. “What? Why? Is something wrong?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No. You do good work. We are going to bring all agency work in-house.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I don’t understand,” I said, pulling into Martin’s driveway and shutting off
    the engine. “We’ve been delivering incredible results . . .”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Budget cuts,” she explained. “We’re looking to hire writers, though. If you
    have any recommendations, let me know.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yeah, us!” I replied, a little too loudly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “When is our contract renewal?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “End of the month,” I replied. My head was swimming. “But listen. Let’s find
    a way to work within your new budget—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The decision is made. Nonnegotiable.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Sooyoung,” I pleaded, “let’s at least meet to discuss—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No need,” she said, cutting me off again. “You do good work for us, but we
    need to make a change.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “When can you pay us? I can’t tell you how many phone calls we’ve made.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She was ready to go. “You finish up the work, we get you paid. Fair?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s not fair,” I responded, tasting stomach acid in my mouth. “It’s like David
    versus Goliath. It’s not fair at all.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Mmm.” I could hear her typing away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We deserve better than this.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You do good work,” she repeated. “But it’s time to move on. Goodbye.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I leapt out of the car and began to vomit. Poor Martin, with his beautiful home
    in this tony suburb of Boston—and me in his driveway, retching into his stump.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My cell phone rang. I was still wearing my headset, and I touch-activated it.
    “This is John,” I moaned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Are you okay?” I lifted my head to see Martin standing at the window of his
    second-floor office, looking down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I had a bad oyster,” I croaked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You want to reschedule? We can reschedule.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No.” I wiped my mouth. “We need to talk.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A few minutes later, revived with some hot tea, I was sitting across from Martin’s
    two-hundred-gallon aquarium. The bubbling was soothing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “How you feeling?” asked Martin. His hair was at the next frizz level. New conditioner?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Better, thanks. Sorry about your stump.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s biodegradable.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Martin, this is a difficult conversation,” I began. “I think it’s time we parted
    ways.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Hmm.” He took a sip of his tea. “Sorry to hear that.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We’re losing clients left and right,” I told him. “Everyone is bringing their
    agency work in-house.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The world is changing,” he agreed. “Faster and faster.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “People don’t just have one career anymore,” I continued. “They have multiple
    careers. Businesses don’t just do one thing; they do multiple things.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Pivots.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Evolution,” I said. “We’re all in a process of evolution. Physical, mental,
    spiritual evolution. If we don’t evolve, we die.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You’ve got to zig when everyone else is zagging.” He zigzagged his fingers
    in the air. “And zag when everyone else is zigging.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that I had spilled my guts on two levels, I felt incredible relief, both
    physically and mentally. “You’ve been a good adviser, Martin. But to become a
    billion-dollar company, we need to reinvent ourselves.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I don’t think this has worked out as either of us had hoped,” Martin agreed.
    “But you’re going to do fine. And if you need anything at all, I’m happy to help.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Martin, you are a class act.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “So what’s your next step?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was the first time I had smiled all day. “Blockchain,” I replied. “We’re
    going all in on blockchain.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“Blockchain.” Martin took a sip of his tea and looked thoughtful. “Remind me
    again: What is blockchain?”'
