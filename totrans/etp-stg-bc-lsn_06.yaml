    contracting parties to deliver a finished product on time and in accordance with
    negotiated prices and contract conditions. Value chains (which chart the stages
    though which customer value is created, from R&D through manufacturing and marketing)
    are dispersed across multiple countries; materials, components, and subsystems
    need to be available in sequence to complete the finished product. Such a value
    chain benefits from participation of and cooperation from value-creating enterprises,
    transportation providers, and regulators monitoring compliance with differing
    regulations in multiple legal jurisdictions.

    rendered is necessary for transfer of control and ownership to the next actor

    conducted on an open account or through the more traditional LC. In other words,
    sellers may accept LCs furnished by buyers and obtain eventual payment or extend
    credit directly to the customer. When directly extending credit, the seller can
    collect from their customers at the end of the period of credit extension, or
    factor such receivables, collecting a discounted amount of their face value immediately
    to increase their liquidity. Similarly, buyers may need to obtain financing to
    offer acceptable payment terms to the seller, and access to such financing may
    be contingent on proof of contract fulfillment and receipt of goods.

    applications have launched and progressed to reach operational scale. Blockchain
    usage can satisfy many pressing supply chain needs, ultimately enhancing performance.
    For example, deploying blockchain can provide supply chains with timely accurate
    information, secure and free from tampering, and aid in detecting fraud and counterfeiting.
    Immutability and cryptographically assured security can save costs by reducing
    the involvement of intermediaries. Smart contracts triggered by data entering
    the blockchain, including from IoT devices, can automate transactions, including
    speeding up shipment flow and expediting payment. In addition, trusted data from
    the blockchain can verify provenance and bolster quality assurance, and the data
    accumulated within the blockchain can become the basis for analytical insights
    underlying future supply chain improvements.[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en210)

    volume of documentation that accompanies the goods being shipped. These documents
    verify ownership, stage in transit, regulatory compliance, and change in ownership.
    Complete and accurate documentation is essential to an uninterrupted shipment
    journey to the ultimate destination because correctly filled, verified, and duly
    assigned documentation is necessary for shipment clearance and handoff to subsequent
    stages. Global supply chains function ponderously in large part because they rely
    on paper-based processes for most of their documentation. Conflicting information
    and lost documents lead to errors and suspend transaction approval. This creates
    a domino effect that results in long lead times, obscured status and location
    of a shipment, and inefficient capital allocation (due to higher investment in
    pipeline inventory).

- en: When buyers finance their purchases with LC, proper documentation and verification
    is essential if the seller is to get paid. The issuing bank, acting for the buyer,
    issues an LC that the seller presents on completing a shipment. The bank honoring
    the compliant LC by releasing payment will in turn expect repayment from the buyer
    on the terms agreed. Hence, the issuing bank will not release payment unless it
    (or its representatives) has ascertained that the trade documents (e.g., the bill
    of lading) comply with the LC terms (description of goods, condition, quantity).
    Furthermore, the issuing bank will use its discretion in determining whether the
    LC terms have been met, and if it decides that there is a discrepancy, it must
    get the buyer’s waiver or assent before payment is made. In other words, the issuing
    bank cannot make unilateral decisions.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en211) Thus, documentation
    is essential, both for the smooth transfer of goods across intermediary points
    in the supply chain and for authorizing payment against proof of compliance with
    the sales contract and LC terms.

    LCs are often issued as MT700 messages within the SWIFT network. Any changes in
    transit would require updated documentation consistent with the changes to permit
    continued processing and onward movement. Interruptions can result from changed
    contract terms or a lack of accurate updated information at both origin and destination.
    Obtaining the necessary modified documents can be a slow process that causes delays
    while raising costs. In many cases, supply chain actors have resorted to developing
    personal connections with expeditors at various locations to obtain such information
    and overcome bottlenecks.

    nodes. Developing such a decentralized network involves working with and obtaining
    the participation of a large variety of potential ecosystem partners. There may
    be variations in each partner’s (or node’s) level of technical understanding and
    process capabilities. The network would be operating within different national
    jurisdictions, attempting to comply with different legal systems that might have
    conflicting requirements while implementing blockchain technology that is still
    evolving and by no means mature. And yet, there are pilots around the world whose

    information could be simultaneously and securely available to supply chain participants;
    enhanced shipment tracking, transparency, and trust in data provided by the network;
    shipment monitoring, such as confirming origin and provenance (bringing to light

    of problems arising from supply delays, shortages, and faulty products (particularly
    useful in food chains, where food safety is paramount and timely knowledge can
    alert clients to suboptimal shipment conditions, contamination problems, and noncompliance
    with legal regulations). A well-known example of such outcomes is IBM’s work with
    Everledger, which has digitally encrypted over one million diamonds on the blockchain,

    such as for APIs that allow third parties to add new modules and additional functionality
    to TradeLens. Such common standards are essential for ease of use, coordination,
    and collaboration across network members with varying IT configurations. In using
    Hyperledger Fabric, TradeLens can include a separate smart contract layer run
    in a container environment without direct access to the ledger state, with specific
    peer nodes (depending on the transaction), vouching for the correct execution

    from IoT sensors across the production value chain to offer verification of the
    provenance of the livestock, while IoT devices from the dairy farms and milk transportation
    tankers can verify the time and temperature at which the milk was collected and
    then received by the tankers. The dairy farm IoT sensors also attest to the levels
    of bacteria and antibiotics in milk as well as conjugated linoleic acid and Alpha-linolenic
    acid, which are associated with anti-inflammatory effects and an important cheese
    quality consideration.

    curdled, conditions at pressing (to remove moisture), the duration and extent
    of salting, the duration and temperature during refining, and key measurements
    that point to the control of the fermentation process. The IoT data captured in
    the blockchain helps assure buyers of the quality of the Swiss cheese on offer.[17](14085-0014.xhtml#en226)

    is a supply chain application that aims to address assurance of food safety by
    teaming with food industry leaders such as Dole, Kroger, Nestle, Tyson Foods,
    and Walmart to implement blockchain solutions along the supply chain. The project
    focuses first on food safety and seeks to securely trace products in seconds,
    help determine and mitigate sources of contamination, and reduce the economic
    burden of recalls that may become necessary. Second, the project emphasizes food
    freshness, using blockchain to increase supply chain visibility and optimize shelf
    life. Third, the focus on food freshness and early mitigation of contamination
    helps reduce food waste and maximize shelf life. These goals together help optimize
    the food supply chain and allow the industry to respond effectively to recalls.
    Such supply chain enhancement could also help meet sustainability goals, improve
    food quality, and certify provenance—the latter being an issue of growing importance
    in the organic and meat substitute markets.

    described above. Jasper and Ubin explored the use of DLT-based settlement for
    tokenized digital currencies across different blockchain platforms. The project
    leaders noted there are alternatives to the DLT technology used in the proposed
    model but that “DLT could offer an easier and faster path toward adoption than
    a centralized approach because it can leave the different jurisdictions involved
    in control of their portion of the network while allowing for tight integration
    with the rest of the network.”[24](14085-0014.xhtml#en233) The pilot uses Hash
    Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs, a type of smart contract) to ensure that all the
    events necessary to justify a payment have occurred. HTLCs involve locking the
    asset, which then requires the payment recipient to acknowledge receipt with a
    cryptographic proof of payment within a set deadline or else the payment is returned
    to the sender. HTLCs obviate the need for an intermediary (i.e., the correspondent
    bank) to hold an escrow account to ensure satisfactory transaction completion.
    Further, the pilot used two different blockchain platforms—Corda in Canada and
    Quorum in Singapore—to test interoperability issues.

    available for wholesale interbank payment and settlement.[26](14085-0014.xhtml#en235)

    exchanged outside of the bank’s or client’s home country, with commercial banks
    holding multiple CBDC wallets (in different currencies) with their home central
    bank. Then, each central bank would need to support multiple CBDC tokens. An alternative
    to multiple CBDCs would be a universal CBDC linked to the basket of currencies
    of the participating governments and accepted by all these governments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Implementing a wholesale CBDC model as stated would require the various governments
    to agree on procedures to set exchange rates for converting their domestic currency
    into the universal wholesale CBDC. An exchange would have to be set up to issue
    and redeem such CBDCs, with explicit rules allowing them to be used to settle
    cross-border transactions. The CBDC platform would need to operate 24/7 and in
    parallel with RTGS platforms to facilitate cross-border transactions in the CBDC
    between its banks and central bank within a country and across countries. Each
    country would have to set eligibility conditions for banks (or other settlement
    account holders) to hold a digital CBDC wallet in another country without having
    an RTGS account. Such a model would take time to implement as nations and central
    banks would need to implement legislation to accept a universal CBDC and manage
    their monetary policy to include a supply of the universal CBDC. Countries would
    need to agree on how the CBDC could be collateralized with central bank reserves,
    with the exchange rate risk as reserves in one country would be the collateral
    for a CBDC held in another country.

    XRP, to make cross-border payments more efficient. Ripple is innovating with blockchain
    to better serve customers dissatisfied with existing solutions.[28](14085-0014.xhtml#en237)
    Ripple’s blockchain solution has several components. It developed a digital currency,
    XRP, for use in transferring money across borders. In parallel, it developed XRP
    Ledger, a DLT network for its clients, to continually update and store clients’
    cross-border payment transactions and account balances. It then developed and
    implemented xRapid, an open-source blockchain protocol, to validate transactions,
    update ledgers, and complete transfers. Ripple also developed its unique node
    list (UNL),[29](14085-0014.xhtml#en238) with a UNL consisting of select trusted
    nodes that are the only nodes authorized to collectively validate and update the
    ledger with new transactions and balances.[30](14085-0014.xhtml#en239)
  prefs: []

    RippleNet, Ripple’s financial network, which banks and financial institutions
    join if they wish to use Ripple for initiating and managing cross-border payments.
    The key innovation of RippleNet is that clients can exchange the national fiat
    currency of their choice for XRP; transfer the XRP near instantaneously, securely,
    and at low cost; and then immediately convert the XRP received into local currency
    on the other end of the transaction. This is possible because Ripple persuaded
    cryptocurrency exchanges in multiple countries to list XRP for trading. This allows
    entities who participate in sending or receiving XRP to use the exchanges to purchase
    or sell XRP holdings for national currencies such as the US dollar or the euro.
    The emergence and growth in trading volume in XRP on such cryptocurrency exchanges
    gradually increases XRP liquidity, and ease of exchange with various fiat currencies
    at both ends of the remittance corridor, contributing to the willingness of counterparties
    to use XRP for their cross-border remittance needs.

- en: As more banks join RippleNet, multiple routing pathways open for effecting transfers
    through different sets of correspondent banks. Correspondent banks form a network
    through which banks can operate with clients in a country in which they have no
    operations, using a chain of network banks to eventually reach the client. These
    bank groups, collaborating on a transfer through RippleNet, create a network,
    and different networks can compete to complete the transfer with lower fees. This
    results in a competitive transfer fee market, which gives sending clients access
    to lowest cost transfers. Clients first initiate a request to RippleNet to transfer
    XRP across borders, which uses the xRapid protocol to manage the transfer. The
    XRP Ledger maintains the transaction records (continually updated every two seconds),
    and once the latest state of the ledger is validated by most nodes, the XRP transfer
    is completed with payment finalized. Together, the various Ripple features enable
    it to disrupt the cross-border remittance market, increase its market share at
    SWIFT’s expense, and become a major competitor in this payment segment.

    have used since the 1970s for their cross-border remittances. Ripple had to persuade
    regulators in each pair of countries along key remittance corridors to authorize
    XRP use in their markets and its conversion into local currencies. It also had
    to foster a trading market for XRP so that XRP owners could exchange it for fiat
    national currencies and other assets. Such a market is essential if Ripple clients
    are to accept XRP as the basis for cross-border payments.

    to use RippleNet and xRapid to transfer fiat currencies, for a fee lower than
    the cost of using SWIFT. Banks then manage their own liquidity balances in different
    currencies in each country instead of maintaining one pool of liquidity denominated
    in XRP across multiple remittance corridors. Banks can thus use RippleNet instead
    of SWIFT, getting the benefit of real-time settlement at a lower cost while still
    retaining their existing processes for KYC, AML, sanctions screenings, and regulatory
    compliance issues.

    would directly benefit from using XRP, as it would lower their working capital,
    by not having to establish nostro and vostro accounts in different foreign currencies
    in the respective remittance corridors. Transaction fees are paid in XRP, which
    is then burned (the XRP received in transfer fees is taken out of circulation),
    reducing XRP supply and gradually raising its price.

    is built on offering lower cross-border remittance fees, near-instantaneous transfer
    of funds, real-time verification of transfer and receipt, a known exchange rate
    at time of transfer, and a reduction in working capital needs if clients choose
    to replace multiple currencies with XRP in their transfers. Of course, private
    digital currencies such as XRP raise issues such as stability and systemic risk

    cross-border trade, which is characterized by multiple, distinct, and possibly
    conflicting international jurisdictions. (The fairness of a specific judicial
    system and enforcing compliance are pertinent matters.) Since a well-designed
    solution would interest most supply chain participants and increase public welfare
    through job creation, export earnings, and export sector competitiveness, public
    sector participation in ownership and governance that creates a public utility
    could be a worthy development.[34](14085-0014.xhtml#en243)

- en: Before buyers and sellers can begin interacting through global supply chains,
    they need to find each other. Once they do, they negotiate to discover if they
    can arrive at a satisfactory sales agreement, spelling out contract terms agreeable
    to both sides. While buyers can be retail consumers, the focus here is on B2B
    transactions and on industrial buyers contracting in volume for internal use in
    their own processes or for eventual sale to end users. In such B2B situations,
    buyers are likely to choose sellers who can meet their detailed specifications.

    the nature of fiber used, the weaving process resulting in finished cloth, specific
    dyes and colors used, the printing or finishing process for patterns, the design
    for finished garments, quality of stitching, sizes and quantities for each color,
    fabric and pattern, and ancillaries such as fasteners used, labels, and care instructions.
    Buyers may want the freedom to specify quantities to be included in each order
    under the total agreement, the destination of each shipment, storage conditions,
    trans-shipment points, and compliance with customs and other export regulations.
    Buyers may also want control over manufacturing conditions, environmental issues
    and proper disposal of hazardous waste, fair treatment of workers, avoidance of
    child labor, payment of fair wages, and equality in treatment of gender, ethic
    group, and religion.

    designs) and to manage the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. As global
    supply chains involve contracting with suppliers in multiple geographic locations
    subject to varying legal jurisdictions, buyers may find it difficult to verify
    sellers’ ability to comply with contract conditions, such as technological capabilities,
    range of production equipment and total factory capacity, availability of adequate
    working capital, staffing levels to ensure timely production of contracted output,
    a minimum level of experience with similar goods, the satisfaction of other customers
    with this seller, and overall general business reputation.

- en: The difficulty that buyers may encounter in verifying seller capabilities, experience,
    and reputation leads to the use of intermediaries. Intermediaries can take over
    the critical function of qualifying sellers and matching buyers with sellers who
    can meet their desired profile and set of necessary capabilities. They charge
    fees for such services but reduce risk for buyers and increase the likelihood
    of buyers finding a satisfactory source of supply. Li & Fung,[35](14085-0014.xhtml#en244)
    based in Hong Kong, is one such intermediary, with over a hundred years of experience
    and a large pool of potential sellers and contract manufacturers in a wide range
    of countries in Asia and other regions.[36](14085-0014.xhtml#en245) Li & Fung
    uses its staff to audit and verify seller capabilities before offering them as
    potential supply sources matching their buyer clients’ wish list.

- en: Over time, disruptive online marketplaces have emerged to match buyers and sellers
    along the lines described above, competing with traditional matching services
    offered by firms such as Li & Fung. While Li & Fung concentrates on B2B applications,
    linking enterprise buyers with merchant suppliers, Alibaba (Taobao) and Amazon
    offer retail sellers the opportunity to establish web storefronts and connect
    with and sell to Alibaba and Amazon customers; Li & Fung has evolved to also offer
    similar functions. These online marketplaces function as platforms, often multisided
    and open to buyers, sellers, and other supply chain actors such as shippers, freight
    forwarders, financing entities, and insurance companies. They may offer free access
    to buyers or even subsidize them to attract them to their platforms while obtaining
    revenue by charging intermediary access fees and commissions to sellers and other
    parties.

- en: As with other online platforms, these online marketplaces are subject to both
    same-side and cross-side network effects,[37](14085-0014.xhtml#en246) attracting
    more buyers as the number of sellers and contract manufacturers proliferate, and
    as other buyers (competitors) flock to these platforms and obtain satisfactory
    results in their search for potential supply partners. The quality and ease of
    use of application interfaces, privacy protection, and the degree of quality control
    exercised in enabling provider access to the network are all factors determining
    the extent of online platform usage. As with most platforms subject to network
    effects, a limited number of platforms are likely to emerge as survivors and become
    oligopolies, with the potential to charge higher intermediary fees and capture
    a greater share of the value created by buyer-seller interaction and contracting.

- en: It is in the context of preventing such platform marketplace oligopolies and
    avoiding the payment of rising intermediary fees that blockchain-based marketplaces
    appear as an alternative. The blockchain platform would allow buyers and sellers
    to interact with each other directly, avoiding or reducing intermediary fees.
    Such platforms can also offer escrow accounts, releasing payment against proof
    of performance. As discussed previously, HTLCs can be used to execute the simultaneous
    exchange of payment for performance completion. The data accumulated over multiple
    buyers and transactions can inform and lead to better forecasting of demand and
    market trends, aiding buyers in avoiding the need to discount excess merchandise.

    members, the blockchain’s governance mechanisms would need consent from members
    to include their transaction data in the aggregated database, and then develop
    algorithms to conduct data analytics. Next, the managers would need to price such
    services, offering varying prices for member segments linked to their cooperation
    in aggregating the data necessary for forecasting and obtaining member consent
    to sell such trend analysis and forecasting services to nonmembers, for higher
    fees. Such fees from external clients can subsidize further development and upgrades
    to the blockchain solution. The platform can also help manage any tax consequences
    from such transactions.

    in qualifying sellers; certifying their experience, capabilities, and reputation;
    and guaranteeing performance. A recent attempt is the Trust Your Supplier network
    from IBM and Chainyard.[38](14085-0014.xhtml#en247) A common thread lies in using
    blockchain’s ability to create and use tokens native to the blockchain to qualify
    sellers and their commercial reputation, with tokens awarded to a seller for high
    performance in meeting contractual commitments. A seller’s accumulated tokens
    can serve as a proxy for reputation score, and buyers can use such reputation
    scores in choosing between alternative sources, patronizing higher-performing
    sellers or contract manufacturers. Suppliers can also reward loyal buyers and
    contract renewal with such tokens, as payment for loyalty and repeat business,
    with tokens exchangeable for seller services.

- en: A platform such as Trust Your Supplier concentrates on enabling enterprises
    to find qualified trustworthy suppliers, with immutable supplier certification
    in meeting ISO standards, sustainability ratings, diversity, and reputation. The
    platform can help a merchant rapidly assess a potential supplier, drawing on their
    reliability record, performance ratings, and answers to FAQs from other users.
    It does this by using third parties such as Dun & Bradstreet to validate supplier
    records, EcoVadis for sustainability profile, and banks and entities such as RapidRatings
    that can verify account information and financial profile and risk. Clients can
    interact with the Trust Your Supplier application with web interfaces (APIs) and
    through procurement platforms such as SAP Ariba, and they can use a personalized
    dashboard to find and then select between qualified suppliers. Sellers who are
    not meeting their commitments, or acting in bad faith, can be denied access to
    the platform, with similar sanctions for buyers. IBM refers to these services
    as providing suppliers with a “blockchain-enabled digital passport.”[39](14085-0014.xhtml#en248)
    Sharing such passport data reduces time to validate and onboard that supplier

    currency and payments, DeFi applications using digital currencies, and global
    supply chains and trade finance. These applications share a common element: they
    consist of multiple independent firms that come together to meet customer needs.
    This requires that they share information, trust each other, and collaborate in
    the best interests of the customer while remaining competitive and attempting
    to increase their profitability, forming ecosystems to provide customer solutions.
    Blockchains are uniquely suited to function effectively in ecosystems, and in
    chapter 6, I discuss the ecosystems framework and its strategic implications.
    I then draw on the varied results of several applications and pilots to discuss
    how enterprises can best leverage the ecosystem perspective to launch successful
    blockchain applications.'
