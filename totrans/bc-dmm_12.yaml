    who are building industry standards for blockchain frameworks and platforms. Their
    work is important because they’re the main group shepherding the blockchain industry
    into the mainstream and commercial adoption. Hyperledger is the “safe” deployment
    platform for enterprise teams.

- en: At the end of 2015, the Linux Foundation formed the Hyperledger project to develop
    an enterprise-grade and open-source distributed ledger framework. They hoped to
    focus the blockchain community on building robust, industry-specific applications,
    platforms, and hardware systems to support businesses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Linux Foundation saw that there were many different groups building blockchain
    technology without a cohesive direction. The industry was duplicating effort and
    the tribalism was leading teams to solve the same problem twice. The foundation
    knew from its experiences that if this technology was to realize its full potential,
    an open-source and collaborative development strategy was desperately needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Hyperledger project is led by Executive Director Brian Behlendorf, who has
    decades of experience dating back to the original Linux Foundation and Apache
    Foundation, as well as being a CTO of the World Economic Forum. So it’s not surprising
    that Hyperledger has been well received. Many of the top business and industry
    leaders have joined the project, including Accenture, Cisco, Fujitsu Limited,
    IBM, Intel, J.P. Morgan, and Wells Fargo. It has also attracted many of the top
    blockchain organizations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: R3, a consortium supporting the banking industry, has contributed its financial
    transaction architectural framework. Digital Asset, the software company, gave
    the Hyperledger mark and some of its enterprise-grade code. The Factom Foundation
    is also contributing enterprise-grade code and developer resources. IBM and many
    other organizations are contributing code and other resources to the project.
  prefs: []

- en: Hyperledger’s technical steering committees ensure robustness and interoperability
    between these different technologies. The hope is that the cross-industry, open-source
    collaboration will advance blockchain technology and deliver billions in economic
    value by sharing the costs of research and development across many organizations.

- en: Hyperledger is identifying and addressing the important features and requirements
    missing from the blockchain technology ecosystem. It’s also fostering a cross-industry
    open standard for distributed ledgers and holding open space for developers to
    contribute to building better blockchain systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hyperledger has a project life cycle similar to that of the Linux Foundation.
    A proposal is submitted and then the accepted proposals are brought into incubation.
    When a project has reached a stable state, it graduates and is moved into an active
    state. As of yet, all Hyperledger projects are in the proposal or incubation stage.
    Each of the projects is led by a large corporation or startup. For example, Fabric
    is led by IBM, Sawtooth by Intel, and Iroha by the startup Soramitsu.

    and Slack ([`https://slack.hyperledger.org`](https://slack.hyperledger.org)) to
    connect with teams working on each of the projects. These are great places to
    get the latest updates and to check on the progress that these projects are making
    in development.  ## Focusing on Fabric'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hyperledger’s first incubation project, Fabric, is a permissioned blockchain
    platform. It works like most blockchains in that it keeps a ledger of digital
    events. These events are structured as transactions and shared among the different
    participants. The transactions are executed without a cryptocurrency. An optional
    resource for you to dive deeper into the subject is at [`https://trustindigitallife.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/marko_vukolic.pdf`](https://trustindigitallife.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/marko_vukolic.pdf).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All transactions are secured, private, and confidential. Fabric can only be
    updated by consensus of the participants. When records have been inputted, they
    can never be altered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fabric is an enterprise solution interested in scalability and being in compliance
    with regulations. All participants must register proof of identity to membership
    services in order to gain access to the system. Fabric issues transactions with
    derived certificates that are unlinkable to the owning participant, thereby offering
    anonymity on the network. Also, the content of each transaction is encrypted to
    ensure only the intended participants can see the content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fabric has a modular architecture. You can add or take way components by implementing
    its protocol specification. Its container technology can handle most of the mainstream
    languages for smart contracts development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bitcoin, on the other hand, allows anyone to participate anonymously and the
    community is always looking for ways to be censorship resistant and to enable
    those who have been disenfranchised. Bitcoin was also mainly engineered for the
    movement and security of its cryptocurrency token. For this reason, comparing
    the best practices of Bitcoin to those of Fabric may be unfair.

    toward. You’ll be able to use Fabric over the outlined use cases in the near future
    with intuitive user interfaces. For now, you can develop and test the listed use
    cases with the help of a core developer.  ### Diving into chaincode development'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contracts between two parties can be translated into code on the Hyperledger
    Fabric via Chaincode. Chaincode is Hyperledger’s version of Ethereum’s smart contract.
    It automates the agreements made within a contract in a way that both parties
    can trust.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chaincode is Turing complete like the smart contracts of Ethereum. Currently,
    you can have a Java developer build a chaincode contract for you. The Fabric team
    has prepared some common use cases such as digital currencies and sending text
    messages as part of the core framework.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    were not complete at the time of this writing but may be available by the time
    you’re reading this.

    Ethereum’s work. However, each of the projects does have substantial teams and
    resources devoted to it:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Business contracts:** Hyperledger has come up with ways to have both public
    contracts and private contracts. Private contracts are between two or more parties
    and contain confidential information. Public contracts are viewable by anyone
    who takes the time to search for them within Hyperledger. For example, you might
    use a public contract to make a public offer to sell a product or as a way to
    solicit bids on a contract.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The makeup of these contracts is more complex than traditional contracts because
    arbitration and third-party enforcement are removed. Additionally, the authentication
    of the individuals participating in the contract is needed. Plus, most contracts
    are unique and can’t be standardized. The more complex the contract, the more
    places it can be corrupted from its original intent. Hyperledger is working on
    creating a contract management system to help enhance the scalability of Chaincode.

- en: '**Manufacturing supply chain:** Supply chain management is an exciting blockchain
    scheme that is being explored on Fabric. Final assemblers could manage all the
    component parts and supplies that they used in creating their product. This feature
    would enable you to be responsive to demands and be able to track back the origin
    of each part to the original producer. In the case of a product recall, it would
    be easy to find the culprit or the ability to tell the authenticity of each part
    before it’s utilized.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fabric requires more development before it’s ready for this use case because
    it will need to be easily accessible to everyone in the supply chain. The Fabric
    team is working on a standard protocol to allow every participant on a supply
    chain network to input and to track numbered parts that are produced and used
    on a specific product.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it’s finished, this use case would allow deep searches to be done on the
    production of each product at any time. This might be ten or more layers deep
    in the production of any one item. Consumers could then establish the provenance
    of any manufactured good that is made up of other component goods and supplies.
    This may have an interesting social impact on consumption.

- en: '**Securities and assets:** Securities and other assets are well suited to blockchain
    because they can automate many of the functions that third parties perform. Fabric
    will allow all stakeholders of an asset to have direct access to that asset and
    its makeup and history, bypassing intermediaries that now hold that information.
    Fabric will also speed up the settlement time on assets to near real time.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Direct communication:** In the future, Fabric could also be used as a place
    where companies can make public announcements and offers. For example, if a company
    wanted to raise funds and needed to notify all shareholders of the complete details
    of the offer in real time, it could. Like the decentralized autonomous organization
    (DAO) of Ethereum, shareholders can make decisions and execute them. Their decisions
    will be processed and settled in real time. This will make shareholder meetings
    and voting much easier and faster.'

    the same functionality as the Ripple network (see [Chapter 6](11_9781119365594-ch06.xhtml)).
    It has imagined use cases where companies could exchange assets in low-liquidity
    markets by matching demands between multiple parties. Instead of settling for
    market limits on direct trading between two parties, a chain network connects
    buyers with sellers and finds the best match across multiple asset classes. Hyperledger
    looks to be well positioned in the future to trade derivatives. You can read more
    about this work at [`http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/TradingDerivatives_LinuxCon_2016.pdf`](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/TradingDerivatives_LinuxCon_2016.pdf).  ##
    Investigating the Iroha Project'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hyperledger’s Iroha project is building on the work completed in the Fabric
    project. It’s meant to complement Fabric, Sawtooth Lake, and the other projects
    under Hyperledger. Hyperledger added the Iroha project to incubation because the
    other projects didn’t have any infrastructure projects written in C++. Not having
    a C++ project severely limited how many people could benefit from the work on
    Hyperledger and the number of developers who could contribute to the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, most blockchain development at this point has been at the lowest
    infrastructure level, and there has been little to no development work on user
    interaction or mobile applications. Hyperledger believes that Iroha is necessary
    for the popularization of blockchain technology. This project fills the gap in
    the market by bringing in more developers and providing libraries for mobile user
    interface development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with Fabric or Sawtooth Lake. Hyperledger has plans to expand functionality to
    work with the other blockchain projects soon. Its iOS, Android, and JavaScript
    libraries will provide supportive functions like digitally signing transactions.
    It will be very useful for commercial app development, and it will add new layers
    of security and business models only possible with blockchain technology.

    The way they ensure the records have not been changed is through publicly publishing
    their blockchains as proof that it has not been altered. The published ledger
    acts as a public witness that anyone can roll back and check. It’s sort of like
    publishing an ad in a newspaper to prove something happened.
