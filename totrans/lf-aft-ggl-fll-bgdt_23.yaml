    major international transactions. With a 21-million-unit cap, it is not a stable
    unit of account. Focusing on security, its “script” language is serviceable but
    not Turing-complete, lacking recursive loops. So it is limited in its ability
    to accommodate smart contracts, but limited also in its vulnerability to hacks.

    Hedera white paper puts it, “At the end of each round, each node calculates the
    shared state after processing all the transactions that were received in that
    round and before. It then digitally signs a hash of that shared state, puts it

    of the bitcoin chain as well. And just as with bitcoin, the addresses run back

    bears a graph of the hashes of transactions reported to it by other nodes in the
    universal gossip process. No actual voting has to take place, because the hash
    graph on every node collects sufficient information to order and reconcile all
    the transactions objectively in time. The gossip process of propagating information
    also provides a consensus on the state of the system, without any further communication.
    If it works—and no one has proved that it doesn’t—this virtual voting system is
    a coup, a faster and better mousetrap, and it is catching a lot of mice (national
    credit unions, healthcare systems, and still unnamed big banks).

    feature that changes the nature of the beast. The pivotal question is whether
    its management will choose a stable coin model (gold or other truly “time”-based
