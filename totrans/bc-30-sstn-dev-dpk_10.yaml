- en: The term “sustainability” has become a buzzword in recent years. It also turned
    the researchers toward its side. Sustainable fashion has gained attention nowadays,
    and it is a recent movement that aims to reduce the environmental pollution caused
    by the fashion industry. The prime aim is to reduce global pollution in order
    to run the industry in an eco-friendly manner. Sustainable fashion also ensures
    the limited consumption of resources in order to make an industry that will be
    more sustainable in the long run. Researchers are deeply analyzing this fashion
    industry sustainability since it has got a large scope. This chapter presents
    a brief survey about sustainable fashion, role of blockchain technology and its
    importance.

    makes us look good and changes the lifestyle. It makes us perfect with the clothes
    we wear and the admiration of people by our look. Fashion bears creativity among
    the designer as well as among the people who choose. It also improves the idea
    and the way we live. The important categories of fashion depend on groups those
    accepted, duration which it lasts and size ranges. There are a variety of fashion

    view. It completely focuses on the source, design, manufacture and cost that benefits
    the people and communicates and will impact the environment less. This fashion
    mainly focuses on the environment and economic acceptance. This only uses natural
    materials and avoids pollution, and also we will have the safe unchemical fashion
    with the shortage of wastes and so on. It makes us feel so elegant and comfortable.
    The most important goal and priority over here are to buy fewer clothes and use
    them for a longer period. Sustainable fashion has the greatest brand to use and
    a trustable one. It is also referred to as slow fashion. Moreover, the commitments
    for sustainability are shared throughout the product life cycle, making us look
    cool and stylish for a longer period. So our amount would be saved, and this style
    not only fits women but also men, kids and adults, making them happy and comfortable.
    It includes all kinds of varieties, and it uses cotton fabric, which is good for
    health too. It also focuses on ethics and transparency from the outwear to the
    footwear and accessories. This fashion also accepts reusable things where you
    can send the unused clothing to the companies. They buy and recycle and provide
    you with the likable form back to you again. The concept of reducing, reusing
    and recycling is the main motto of sustainable fashion.

    and ethical fashion became known in 1990\. This slow fashion movement helps us
    to make the manufacturers in a perfect and healthy condition, increasing the sustainable
    fashion. It is also investigated [[1](#b_9783110702507-010_ref_001)] that it constructs
    social impact, which has two types of “reality.” One is, it is constructed through
    social interaction, and the other is the circumstances. The underlying principle
    of sustainable fashion is semistructured interviews and Twitter feeds. These data
    sets were correctly checked with seven processes like reflection, familiarity,
    concept, catalog recode and revaluation. To check the coherence and clarity, check
    the code and recode more than five times. Limitations of this research [[1](#b_9783110702507-010_ref_001)]
    are the size of the sample, understanding the individual target and if the sample
    size is not correctly represented, it would be avoided. Sustainable fashion is
    creative, interesting and affordable. A challenging part here is precisely communicating
    the advantage of this fashion. Many large companies like H&M, STELLA and so on
    make their fashion perfect and of good quality. Talking about the consumer part,
    magazines, TV and media have become the huge source of making sustainable fashion
    as style and perfect. It also includes the environmental surroundings, use of
    renewable, raw materials, durable time and measures using the things again and
    again as reusing material. There are two themes playing a role here: one is **transparency**
    and another is **traceability.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and **traceability** shows the supply chain rather than the original material
    as transparency does. Both these two themes play a role for the longer term. Though
    sustainable fashion is a slow fashion, it provides customer satisfaction by providing
    fair wage to the customers. It also protects us from greenwashing and this was
    tabled in the fashion matrix to check the progress sustainably. Also, we can understand
    different persons like customers, marketers and companies, and talk to them individually
    and make them understand what is a sustainable fashion and what it does and how
    it will profit them. The fashion matrix chart and table hold all these analyses
    and priority chart as shown in [Figure 10.1](#b_9783110702507-010_fig_001).'

    people are depleting that at an alarming rate. Sustainability becomes the need
    of the hour to prevent further depletion of the resources. Climatic change, pollution
    and biodiversity extinction are all major areas to be considered and saved as
    soon as possible. Fortunately, we have a wide range of technologies to cope with
    the situation and provide a better solution for the social and environmental problems.
    One such emerging technology is blockchain, and it has a wide range of scope beyond
    the bitcoin. Blockchain provides more transparency, like who bought the product
    and the purpose. Customers also prefer sustainable brands, which is proven by
    the success of fashion brands like Allbirds and Veja. Aside from transparency,
    this technology supports traceability. Also, thanks to blockchain technology,
    consumers can have adequate information about genuinely sustainable products.
    This enables them in order to make informed choices. Few people say, using blockchain
    is digitalizing all this information in a decentralized way.

    the customer to feedback the brands and production often in a very secure and
    protected way, making the product produced in a cycle and transparent manner.
    Once the product’s transparency is done, it moves into the production process
    with the assigned unique token for each product. It also includes technology like
    Quick Response (QR) code and Near-Field Communication (NFC) label. These are the
    proof ideas for achieving perfect transparency for fashion technology as mentioned
    in [Figure 10.2](#b_9783110702507-010_fig_002).

    track the system with proof and payment method. This blockchain technology is
    very helpful to track the products of various brands easily and efficiently. This
    technology has started to grow in many countries for better customer satisfaction,

- en: Today’s fashion industry is a great money-making business affecting each and
    everyone around the world in some way! Fashion is the second most polluting industry
    in the world, which contributes to more pollution and environmental depletion.
    Due to high production and overconsumption of garments than the required need,
    the fashion industry has landed itself on an environmentally damaging circle.
    Thorisdottir and Johannsdottir [[2](#b_9783110702507-010_ref_002)] tried to review
    the fashion industry’s sustainability in the business model and how they investigate
    the fashion business model with empirical studies. This is a composition of many
    kinds of literature about sustainability, and they tried to show the importance
    of sustainability of fashion in the business model. This sustainability agenda
    has been developed over the last four decades. The government and other organizations
    are trying to emphasize this to society by giving more attention to sustainability-related
    issues. Collaboration between government and society also reduces overconsumption
    of natural resources and improves its production and marketing strategies. Whereas
    in recent years, sustainability became a sensitive issue because industries rely
    on production in low-cost countries, where environmental and safety regulations
    were demolished. This environmental issue leads to hectic issues in the disposal
    of huge wastes and products. This lifecycle of the clothing industry has to be
    in control. Producing new varieties of garments has gained attention because of
    the fashion concept.

    fashion models’ sustainability over the years. This literature aims to better
    understand those pieces of literature like how these fashion industries integrate
    and provide sustainability in business models and sustainability-related practices
    to measure the transparency and recognition in what way sustainability drives
    the fashion industry through the business model. This literature’s main motto
    is to detect and do research in trends of sustainability integrations in the fashion
    world. Also, the industry measures and gives reports to increase transparency
    to drive the business model’s fashion. Integrating sustainability-related practices
    into the fashion industry business models is highly important because it is one
    of the most important sources in producing pollution in the world. Such action
    should be beneficial for both society and the environment and provides secure
    transparency within the industry regarding their massive production volumes causing
    significant pollution issues. This path opens for understanding the empirical
    studies on investigating the performance indicators, key elements of sustainability
    in fashion, transparency and disclosures. Such studies provide a more comprehensive
    view of what makes to analyze sustainability within the industry, the actions
    carried out and the societal and importance of environmental benefits.

    in the fashion industry are challenging in recent social development. At this
    moment of environmental modulation and trend in design, a new positive model is
    needed for creative design to achieve sustainable fashion and eco-friendly things.
    In this recent trends and development of fashion, eco-design is the most important
    part of a sustainable supply chain. With this increasing awareness of sustainability,
    it has been a major trend in the fashion industry. The design strategies provide
    a low degree of harm in garment production, reducing the fashion industry’s degradation
    issues. Sustainable design is the method that gives the best solution for an environmental
    problem. The objective of this note is to provide a solution of non-sustainability
    in upcoming and crossed decades. And also, they gave certain analyses related
    to fashion sustainability. They also answered certain ethical fashion, ethics
    and aesthetic values (green aesthetics values), and some other analyses are done
    to check the sustainability. This literature provides overall fashion sustainability,
    clothing functionalities, industrial impact, garbage waste and uncertain changes

    in sustainable fashion is to source and distribute the fast fashion industry cycle
    to increase the pressure. Large companies like H&M are producing sustainable practices
    in management and environmental processes. To choose the data set, their sustainability
    was reported, which helps us grow in socioeconomic background. The global reporting
    initiative helps us report the sector in the previous year and upcoming years,
    including all the company’s conditions and rules in the fast fashion industry.
    For analyzing, they use replicable and valid points from the text as content according
    to their comfort. Texts, paragraphs and sentences are first reported in an individual
    sheet for improvement in further part. A sentence that includes five subcodes
    was then checked and analyzed and made into a framework that the company then
    practiced. This process provides a perfect quantitative and qualitative approach.
    A company also maintained content analysis to check the progress, including their
    aim, performance, risks, improvement, communication and criteria that need to
    be followed, and a map for the sustainable chain is also maintained for each sector.
    Fast industry includes the material, finished and unfinished parts to check the
    company’s input amount. Supply management conditions are not as good as in developed
    countries. These risks should be analyzed and start from the initial part to protect
    the company, and the company carefully follows the supplier’s progress. The single
    sector can be improved with the help of code. This study includes the size of
    the sample, their report, document and limitations, their reality of the band

    Sustainability is extremely important and on everyone’s radar! We came to a situation
    “Enough is enough!” Overconsumption should come to an end. The fashion industries
    have taken this statement and are moving to sustainable fashion. We hope that
    emerging technologies like blockchain must be deeply analyzed since they provide
