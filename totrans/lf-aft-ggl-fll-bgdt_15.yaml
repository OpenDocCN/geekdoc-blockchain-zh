    restore a centrifugal Internet. They were proposing the breakdown of the system
    into just two key structures: monolith, the predictable carriers of the blockchain
    underneath, and metaverse, the inventive and surprising operations of its users
    above. They would provide the foundation for a creative cornucopia.'

- en: Continuing to work on his “New Internet” Ph.D. thesis but running out of funds
    again, Muneeb Ali was more interested in actually building the new network. In
    2012, he had the good fortune to meet Jude Nelson, a tall, blond-haired software
    engineer from Arizona who needed help in Manhattan on a storage project named
    Syndicate, an enterprise file-storage system based on blockchains. Using cryptographic
    mathematics—hashes across time—it provides safe pointers to computer storage locations
    and addresses. Syndicate could use storage facilities like Google Drive, Amazon’s
    S3, and Microsoft Azure as utilities by storing pointers and ID in the blockchain,
    with the data’s owners retaining control.

    it as “the most sophisticated and complex and yet elegant and beautiful program
    I ever came across. And the main thing it does is it gives power back to the people.”
    He joined Nelson working on Syndicate, and two years later Nelson came to work
    for him in Manhattan at Blockstack, then called “OneName,” which Ali and Shea,
    on leave from Princeton, had started in 2013.

    says Shea. “You go onto the net and Facebook or Google or Dropbox or Pinterest
    or Amazon and all want you to move in, giving them all your documents, music,
    providing storage for your life. Medical sites want to store all your health data.
    You have to petition to get it when you want it”—when you need to move to a new
    provider, for example.

    foundations. Ali explains: “Decentralized identity systems enable users to control
    a unique identity recorded on the blockchain that can be recognized by any site.”[¹](notes.html#ch15note-1)
    He contrasts this universal ID with the current “username and password combo that
    can only be recognized by the site that had you create an account.” With the blockchain,
    users can log in to the websites by automatically proving ownership of their identity.'

    companies were forming around bitcoin and the blockchain. But most of them were
    supplying new services (Abra’s blockchain-based remittances to Third World countries),
    currencies (Monero and Zcash, with crypto-coins for ever-deeper privacy), forums
    (Steem, a blockchain Reddit news and commentary board), and markets (AlphaBay,
    emulating the Silk Road drug bazaar).

    a new secure protocol layer for the Internet by which the identification, money,
    power, and property could stay with their owner rather than be sucked up to the
    apps at the top. “I was impressed with Peter Thiel’s perspective,” says Shea.
    “Why would you want to compete with some existing company, be incrementally more
    efficient, and make the world only a slightly better place?”

    View, California, for a stint and demo. Started by the entrepreneur Paul Graham,
    YC was a kind of reverse Hotel California for nerds—hard to get into and easy
    to leave. Thiel told the Y-Combinator in 2015 to seek “apparently bad ideas” that
    “were actually good,” like Dropbox (cloud-based storage) and Airbnb (cloud-based
    lodgings). Both began nebulously at YC and now have a total market cap of many
    billions of dollars.

    Ryan Shea, the CEO, sums it up: “We are going for a much simpler system than Ethereum.
    With a larger attack surface, more things can go wrong. We are using blockchain
    and software for the core functions of naming, discovery of routing information,
    and payments. . . . [C]ore components like identity and discovery should not be
    done in a way that exposes a large attack surface.”'

- en: While Blockstack minimizes the use of blockchain for storage and complex computation,
    Ethereum burdens its chain with both storage and software loops and recursions.
    Thus it may become less efficient and less scalable and more complex and vulnerable.
    While Blockstack focuses on the infrastructural foundation of the network—naming,
    identity, and pointers to storage—Ethereum has become “a token factory,” in Nelson’s
    phrase. It provides a broad computational Turing machine for smart contracts and
    tokens that exposes a large attack surface to external hacks and internal bugs.

    and property rights, Ethereum is a high-entropy platform for Internet money-making,

    strengths today. It is Ethereum that has accomplished a spectacular breakthrough,
    overcoming the fundraising freeze for high-tech startups and fin-tech innovators.
    But Ali and his team were determined to restore a distributed Internet first and
    develop financial devices only after trust was restored.

    throng of hundreds of new companies raising billions of dollars to launch new
    capabilities for a reformed Internet based on the blockchain-distributed ledger
    innovations of Satoshi. Ethereum, its ether valued at $60 billion as I write,
    is obviously the current leader in providing a global distributed platform for
    new Internet-like functionality. But Blockstack enjoys strategic advantages.

    only a single transparent and immutable view of its “state” of time-stamped records)
    while being organizationally decentralized (distributing control and replicating
    ledger accounts across all the nodes of the network). Satoshi’s blockchain is
    the first embodiment of these two apparently contradictory concepts, which evoke
    the medieval concept of the cadastre, a public record of all real property in
    a jurisdiction.'

    control plane (insulated in the blockchain) from the data plane, which can be
    dispersed across the network. This principle saves the blockchain for critical
    path functions of identity, payments, security, and discovery, while relegating
    bulk data storage and complex processing to any number of diverse cloud and edge
    facilities.'

- en: Blockstack’s initial goal was a domain name service (DNS) installed in a blockchain.
    Translating natural language names and site titles into Internet address numbers,
    a DNS participates in your every move on the Net. A DNS constitutes a Trusted
    Third Party such as Verisign or GoDaddy or, increasingly, Google’s own free public
    DNS. It has become another case of segmentation of the Net and a point of vulnerability
    for phishing to usurp names and identities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moving the DNS to the blockchain, Blockstack eliminates an important point of
    vulnerability on the Internet. Names are time-stamped, immutably stored, and distributed
    to all the nodes on the Net through the blockchain ledger. At first, Blockstack
    chose to use the Namecoin blockchain, one of the first bitcoin rivals, optimized
    for storing immutable names. But by 2016, Ali and Shea noticed that Namecoin was
    increasingly vulnerable to attack by an increasingly concentrated group of miners.
    Scrutinizing data on all the available blockchains, including Ethereum, they discovered
    that by far the most robust, secure, and reliable blockchain was Satoshi’s bitcoin
    blockchain. Blockstack now faced a critical test, having to move some eighty thousand
    subscribers from one blockchain to another. Fortunately, the team had already
    anticipated this kind of challenge with Jude Nelson’s virtual chains in the code.[²](notes.html#ch15note-2)

- en: Nelson recalls, “Soon we intend to give each application the ability to form
    its own blockchain securely. I’d argue that this makes it easier for average people
    to reap the business successes of blockchain-powered companies, since (1) there
    are more of them now, and (2) they all have tokens whose value may appreciate.
    Ethereum sort of does this with ERC20, but it doesn’t work at scale. Plus, each
    ERC20 application is tied to the fate of Ethereum, which may make them less likely
    to survive in the long run.” Unlike Ethereum with its esoteric Solidity, Blockstack
    makes its platform programmable in Brendan Eich’s JavaScript, the world’s most
    widespread computer language.

    distributed names. Raising $50 million, it was on its way, building a new trust,
    ID, and transactions layer for the Internet. Better than cash, it offers exchanges
    that conceal personal information but also allow complete proof of compliance
    where necessary. Not only can you exchange anonymously, you can also prove your
    record of behavior if a government makes untrue charges or a business makes spurious
    claims. This combination of security and attestation makes cryptocurrencies a
    fundamental improvement on existing moneys—a remedy for the monetary turbulence
    of our time.
