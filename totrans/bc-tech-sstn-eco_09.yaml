- en: Traditional supply chain management (SCM) has some drawbacks concerning real-time
    and secure data about goods in transit. These require transparency to establish
    trust among various entities involved. Currently, it is being managed by third-party
    centralized controllers which make data more vulnerable. These disadvantages can
    be overcome by the adoption of blockchain in SCM. Blockchain is a decentralized
    ledger for storing, recording, managing, and transmitting data in a peer-to-peer
    (P2P) network. In such protocols, immutable cryptographic signatures named as
    hash are used to record transactions. It records information in such a manner
    that makes it completely impossible to alter, change, cheat or hack the system.
    Verification of transactions and consensus algorithms maintain data integrity
    and security. This paper works toward providing a brief survey on recent advances
    in SCM and comprehensively shows different ways of integrating blockchain technology
    in SCM according to different use cases. This paper comprehensively presents the
    evolution of blockchain technology and its current state. It provides a summary
    of different types of blockchain and the internal architecture of a standard blockchain
    protocol. The paper encapsulates some standard consensus methods such as proof
    of stake and proof of work. Further, the work summarizes various challenges associated
    with inculcating blockchain and highlights the major future research scopes in
    this context.

- en: SCM is the process of enhancing the entire business architecture by making it
    more flexible and agile. The main purpose of SCM is to upgrade the goods or services
    and to focus on how to maximize the total value and capital of the organization
    by efficiently managing the resources. SCM represents the attempts by the producers
    to create and implement the supply chains in a more feasible and effective way
    aiming to centrally control the production of the goods. There are five basic
    elements in an SCM system that are planning, sourcing, making, delivering, and
    returning. Blockchain is one of the most evolving technologies in the present
    world and has a versatile implementation for trade arrangements, cross-border
    transactions, business decentralization, and many more. Blockchain is a decentralized
    system of managing data and information implemented on a P2P network [[1](#CR1)].
    Blockchain, being decentralized, is capable of eliminating a single point of failure
    by using immutable documentation of the data and authorized admittance of the
    user [[2](#CR2)]. Transparency, traceability, security, efficiency, confidentiality,
    and immutability are the key features that can be ensured in the SCM system with
    the implementation of blockchain technology [[3](#CR3)].

- en: Various challenges in the supply chain can be solved based on the above-mentioned
    blockchain features. There is a wide array of use cases of blockchain in SCM like
    invoice processing, logistics, product traceability, etc. Blockchain helps industries
    like E-commerce, logistics, agriculture, food, etc. [[4](#CR4)]. The tokenization
    of a product or an asset helps to make it tradeable [[5](#CR5)]. Blockchain when
    added with the Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be used for traceability in
    the food and pharmaceutical industries [[6](#CR6)]. IoT devices can record different
    metrics such as temperature, humidity, and vibration [[7](#CR7)]. In order to
    ensure automatic redress, blockchain and smart contracts are implemented in case
    the readings fluctuate out of the range [[8](#CR8)]. The implementation of the
    blockchain using smart contracts that can automatically redress the errors in
    the data displays a splendid example of the recent advances in SCM and how it
    can be decentralized and can be made more efficient by using blockchain. A summary
    of the contributions of this work is mentioned below.

    on a lightweight blockchain that uses radio frequency identification (RFID)-based
    authentication. This system is developed for a 5G mobile computing environment
    called lightweight blockchain-enabled radio frequency identification (LBRAPS).
    LBRAPS uses operations like one-way cryptographic hash, bitwise exclusive-or (XOR),
    bitwise rotation only. This mobile computing environment is secured against attacks.
    The trade-off in functionality, communication, computation costs, and features
    of LBRAPS is better than that of existing protocols**.** Chang et al. [[10](#CR10)]

    of the supply chain from a point of view of literary analysis. It also highlights
    future efforts regarding supply chain and blockchain integration and their social
    impact. Malik et al. [[11](#CR11)] propose a three-layer framework called Trustchain
    that tracks interaction among participants of the supply chain. It actively assigns
    scores considering all the interactions and reputation. The novelty of Trustchain
    stems forms a model that evaluates reputation on parameters like entity trustworthiness,
    events on the blockchain, quality of commodities, also its support for reputation
    scores that separate between products and a supply chain participant, enabling
    the allocation of product-specific reputations for the same participant and uses
    smart contracts for automated and unbiased calculation of scores.

    in the modern supply chain. Sahai et al. [[13](#CR13)] propose a solution that
    makes cryptographic accumulators zero knowledge proofs that guarantee privacy
    as well as traceability. They provide an evaluation for implementing their protocol
    on hyperledger fabric. Their work illustrates a blockchain-based model for the
    supply chain that gives an efficient tracing for contamination while accounting
    for traceability as well as privacy. Shakhbulatov et al. [[14](#CR14)] provide
    a new way to track carbon footprint on food production and its various supply
    chain stages. They design a system to do so by using a cluster-based record keeping
    the private data safe. The system implementation is evaluated on its latency under
    various conditions. They also show blockchain implementation is scalable with
    a large number of rows. Niya et al. [[15](#CR15)] demonstrate the implementation
    of a supply chain application that works on the Ethereum blockchain. This decentralized
    application (DApp) gives a general-purpose platform as well as a hardware-independent
    approach that facilitates object combinations and tracking of transformation.

    solutions between all entities. This structure uses a fine-grained data sharing
    scheme. The smart contract can only be accessed and executed by companies and
    entities that satisfy access policies. This scheme ensures the reliability of
    data and privacy. A comparative study of existing work in this area of study is

    type of decentralized database which records data in such a way that makes it
    completely impractical to alter, change, cheat, and hack the system. It is a kind
    of digital ledger that keeps transactions in a form of records that are further
    distributed and duplicated across the entire blockchain network. Each block in
    the chain consists of some data and is chained together along with the number
    of transactions. The blockchain maintains a chronological order, whenever a new
    data comes into a new block, it gets chained with the previous block and a record
    of that transaction is added to the ledger of every participant. Blockchain works
    on distributed ledger Technology (DLT) in which an immutable cryptographic signature
    named as the hash is used to record transactions.

    Haber in 1991\. They proposed a solution for the security of digital documents,
    and these documents can be secured using a time-stamping technique so that they
    could not be tampered with and backdated. For this, they developed a secured chain
    of blocks using cryptography to store the time-stamped documents. In 1992, the
    concept of Merkle trees was introduced, which makes a more efficient blockchain
    because using it one can store multiple documents in one block [[19](#CR19)].
    A secured chain of blocks can be created using Merkle trees. Record of each data
    is connected to the previous one before it along with the series of data records
    stored in the block. The patent for this lapsed in 2004 and this technology went
    unused.

    for digital cash by cryptographic activist and computer scientist Hal Finney.
    He developed an RSA-signed token that can be further transferred from one person
    to another. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the concept of distributed blockchains.
    According to his introduced design, appending a block in the chain does not require
    any sign by trusted parties. He used the P2P network for verifying and time-stamping
    each transaction. These modifications were so efficient that makes blockchain
    very useful in the modern-day cryptocurrency space. Different stages in the evolution

    and adding the previous transaction. These transactions are bundled together in
    a form of blocks and then delivered to each node in the network. After the distribution

    by structuring compensation. Currently, the concept of PoS is only used by altcoins.

    to sleep for a random amount of wait time that is generated by the PoET. The node
    that wakes up first because of its short wait time will win the block. The workflow
    of PoET is quite similar to PoW, but PoET consumes less power because of its increased

    a P2P network, using these network technology, participants do not require any
    central authority for the confirmation of transactions. Figure [2](#Fig2) shows
    multiple steps associated with the working of a blockchain.![../images/520662_1_En_9_Chapter/520662_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_9_Chapter/520662_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.png)

    and corresponding to that a secured block is created, representing that transaction
    is created. Each block contains three basic elements, i.e., data, a nonce, and
    a hash in the block.

- en: A nonce generates a cryptographic hash when the creation of the first block
    occurs. The data that resides in the block is treated as forever tied and signed
    with the hash and nonce unless it is further mined by the miners. Miners help
    in creating a new block in the chain through a process termed mining [[29](#CR29)].
    Each and every block present in the chain excluding the genesis block that is
    the first block in the chain contains the hash of the previous block along with
    its own unique hash and nonce. To generate an acceptable hash, miners use software
    that can solve complex problems for finding a nonce. Making any kind of change
    or altering any block that is present in the chain requires re-mining of all the
    other blocks that come after that particular block.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After successful mining or creation of a block, the requested transaction is
    broadcasted over the P2P network, as mentioned in step 3 in Fig. [2](#Fig2), to
    validate it by the nodes present in the network [[30](#CR30)]. Any electronic
    device which has copies of the blockchain and can also maintain those copies can
    be termed as nodes in the blockchain. In order to append a new block or make a
    change in the existing block the requested transaction must be algorithmically
    approved by every node associated with that blockchain network. Lastly, once the
    nodes verify the transaction, the new block is appended to the existing blockchain
    as mentioned in the last step of Fig. [2](#Fig2). These blocks are bound and secured
    to each other using cryptographic algorithms.

- en: The supply chain has a big role to play in the world’s economy as it accounts
    for more than 76% of the global trade. Tracks of the supply chain are found way
    back since 1911, when the founder of industrial engineering, Fredrick Taylor,
    tried scientific management to improve the manual loading in his work. Between
    1940 and 1950, to obtain better warehouse space, layout and racking, pallet and
    pallet lifts mechanization was researched to improve logistics. During the 1980s,
    logistics transformation based on personal computing began to improve SCM. In
    the 1990s, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems came into existence to boost
    logistics. Globalization in the manufacturing process during the mid-1990s helped
    spread the term “supply chain”. With the increase in the industries and productions,
    the supply chain became a major part of their development process. Implementation
    of supply chain management nowadays is widely spread in the industry in one or
    the other form. Inventory management, warehouse management, logistics and transportation,
    production, customer service, security, business, e-commerce, etc., are some of
    the fields which are operated based on different SCM methodologies [[31](#CR31)].

    various steps. SCM’s efficiency is measured against the competitive nature of
    the industry to sustain and to provide quality goods and services to the end user
    coping up with high risk and greater demand**.** Sometimes it is difficult to
    keep records of ownership, processes, and materials at multiple steps [[32](#CR32)].
    The kind of SCM which exists today has various limitations [[33](#CR33)]. Rapidly
    increasing demand to operate more transactions and services in the fast-paced
    world globally is tough. Traditional supply chain contract architecture is developed
    based on the asymmetric data of supplier reliability [[34](#CR34)]. Ensuring transparency,
    flexibility, and reduction to risk factors and meeting the needs of end users
    can be managed efficiently using blockchain technology. SCM has become very essential
    in any 34th blockchain-based industry for its improvement and accuracy in real-time
    information about products, in the in-transit movements, and in making correct
    decisions for supply chain operations [[35](#CR35)].

- en: There are several drawbacks in the traditional SCM which cause problems in its
    implementation in the industries. One of the major problems is information asymmetry
    where the length of the supply chain is very large which results in spamming the
    entire SCM from the producers to the clients. Due to such a vast implementation
    of the supply chain, it needs to be more reliable than it has been earlier. Any
    fault in the supply chain will cause a considerable loss for the industry. In
    order to fulfill the dynamically changing requirements, a very reliable technology
    such as blockchain provides a suitable solution for the same [[36](#CR36)]. Blockchain
    is capable of eliminating a single point of damage due to its decentralized behavior
    by using immutable documentation of the data and authorized admittance of the
    user.

- en: There are several requirements that can be efficiently and effectively satisfied
    by the implementation of blockchain, hence there is no better choice than blockchain
    for industries to manage their respective supply chain. Firstly, traceability
    is the most important and frequent use case for management in the quality of sensitive
    products such as food or medicine. Secondly, provenance is required for keeping
    records of product ownership through the supply chain. From origin to the final
    stage, blockchain should grant records of a product at each stage. Thirdly, distribution
    is required because the transaction and the activities in the supply chain will
    not be managed by any centralized organization, and each node in the supply chain
    keeps the record of the state of the transaction, any fault at any network node
    would not result in the entire supply chain to be destroyed. Lastly, immutability,
    sustainability, data privacy, confidentiality, and transparency are some of the
    other major factors considering the implementation of blockchain in SCM [[37](#CR37)].

    transaction records that are managed by multiple nodes which makes it impossible
    to manipulate the transaction records. A blockchain-based supply change can contribute
    to recording price, location, date, certification, quality, and many such related
    data to be managed more efficiently. The traceability of goods and products in
    the supply chain can be improved using blockchain and also helps in reducing the
    chance of loss in the gray market which, in turn, enhances the transparency throughout
    the process of production to supply and also boosts the position as a leader in
    fair production industries [[38](#CR38)].

    blockchain protocols. Hash map table, a secondary data structure can be used to
    operate with the data in the blockchain. Different consensus algorithms and blockchain
    frameworks have been proposed to deal with the problems in the products and services
    supply chain in specific industries. Blockchain can be implemented by Ethereum
    and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) which is a decentralized mechanism with
    efficient and fast data tracking speeds and unchallenging access to data for a
    huge count of stakeholders at different levels in the supply chain [[39](#CR39)].
    In order to input data to the blockchain, standard IoT devices and RFID tags can
    be used on products such as food and wood industries, which can add labels to
    the products and the same can be stored in the corresponding blockchain [[40](#CR40)].

    In order to avoid managerial risks, thievery, fraud, or other miseries, agreements
    and regulated conditions can be written in computer code for implementing smart
    contracts, and when the blockchain network gets added up by these smart contracts,
    they are shared to all the linked nodes [[41](#CR41)]. Any new change in a particular
    database can activate the given conditions which lead to the execution of related
    process flow. Smart contracts may help in the automation of the process and execution
    of the obligation as well. There is a wide array of use cases of blockchain in
    SCM like invoice processing, logistics, product traceability, etc. Blockchain
    helps the e-commerce industry by increasing the efficiency in invoice and payment
    processing [[42](#CR42)]. Moreover, payments can be automated by using smart contracts.
    This is a faster process than the traditional process that may take up to thirty
    days. The tokenization of a product or an asset helps to make it tradeable. Hence,
    the end user can assign ownership without involving any physical transfer of assets.
    Blockchain allied with IoT devices can be used for traceability in the food and
    pharmaceutical industries. IoT devices can record different metrics such as temperature,
    humidity, and vibration. The information is kept in a blockchain, and smart contracts
    are implemented to make sure the self-regulating correctness if any of the feeds
    go out of the defined range.

    Many issues arise due to less visibility in the supply chain and slow responses
    to them [[43](#CR43)]. A consortium, in order to make sure the transparency of
    the entire product transportation and its position, is utilizing blockchain inside
    the supply chain [[44](#CR44)]. Modern supply chains are handled by third parties,
    and therefore, the interaction between suppliers, providers, and customers is
    minimized. The logistics industry can be reinvented by the use of blockchain as
    it provides verifiability to transactions and can be coordinated autonomously
    without involving a third party. Blockchain helps an individual to authenticate
    the source of the product as well as its transportation from the producer to the
    end users. Blockchain in SCM can also revolutionize the energy industry. It may
    enable users to sell excess power to the distributor. Figure [3](#Fig3) shows
    the implementation of blockchain in SCM using various methodologies.![../images/520662_1_En_9_Chapter/520662_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_9_Chapter/520662_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.png)

    Orthodox SCM has various weaknesses regarding data integrity, security, and traceability.
    Blockchain provides automation, and all the drawbacks of SCM are overcome by integrating
    it. Decentralized systems empower permissionless ownership. Consensus is supposed
    to make a decision that means a group of nodes approve the transactions as opposed
    to an individual node. Distributed ledger on P2P networks provides a way to store
    data and makes it immutable. Blockchain also provides tokenization of goods to
    be transported. The paper summarizes and explores different ways of adapting blockchain
    into traditional SCM. This paper also shows various ways to implement blockchain
    depending on various use cases in SCM. It also discusses various trade-offs associated
    with blockchain and SCM. It also highlights directions where advances can be made
    in future concerning blockchain and SCM.
