    football team, in the Bajo Flores area of Buenos Aires, are home to hundreds of
    thousands of poor Bolivian immigrants. Many live in precarious dwellings prone
    to being swept away when the waters of the nearby Matanza River overflow. In the
    middle of this community, however, there is one tiny, two-block street in which
    the housing is of a distinctly stronger foundation. The local school is in that
    neighborhood, as is a health clinic and a host of other institutions used by Argentina’s
    Bolivian cultural community. Charrúa holds no unique geographic advantage over
    all the other neighborhoods in the area. So, the question is: why do the families
    who live in those two blocks seem comparatively blessed? Why is this place the
    focal point of Bolivian-Argentine cultural pride?'

    —— 因此，北方邦或马尼拉村庄贫民窟的贫困居民可能会试图以自己的房屋作为抵押向银行贷款，但没有一家银行会接受。甚至是较富裕的房主在世界各地也经常遇到问题 ——
    他们会从开发商那里购买公寓，结果发现该商人贿赂登记官，使自己的名字保留在所有权证书上。在这样的地方证明所有权是如此不稳定，以至于银行不愿意提供抵押贷款，至少不是以合理的利率。

    their unique private keys, it’s near impossible for one person to unilaterally
    make a change in their favor. The developer in the case described above would,

- en: It goes back to a team of developers, led by Alex Mizrahi, who launched a “Bitcoin
    2.0” implementation called Colored Coins in 2013 based on a 2012 white paper by
    Meni Rosenfeld. The idea was to take unique trusted, certified metadata about
    a real-world asset—perhaps the serial number on the chassis of a car or the geospatial
    coordinates of a piece of land—and associate it with a rightful owner who would
    have private key control over a bitcoin address. Bitcoin transactions include
    information fields, so that when the deed to a car is transferred from one person
    to another, the hash of that document can be inserted into a bitcoin transaction
    that’s validated by the mining network. (Here, the hashing process is similar
    to that which Bitcoin miners themselves do, as explained in chapter three, except
    that it is done by whoever holds the title to the asset, or is otherwise authorized
    to update information about it. Essentially, the text of a title document showing
    any changes to the assignment of rights and obligation, including the owner’s
    name as well as liens on the property, is run through a hashing algorithm that
    produces an alphanumeric string. That hash is then inserted into a blockchain
    transaction.)

    going to incorporate the transaction into a block. The transaction merely becomes
    a vessel within which information about some right or claim is conveyed to the
    world. This is possible because, as we’ve discussed, cryptocurrency on a blockchain
    gives money a capacity that it doesn’t have in the traditional monetary system—it
    becomes programmable, able to communicate information and instructions. Note as
    well that the owner of such an asset need not only use this tool to send an asset
    to someone else; they could also make the transaction between two bitcoin addresses
    that they control, doing so solely to indelibly record the fact that they have
    a claim on a house, car, or other asset.

    startup called Chromaway that has a contract to register land titles in Sweden—was
    a significant breakthrough. It raised the prospect of tamper-proof asset registries,

    after you’ve put down your money for this part of the process? A title company
    searches through the property title’s history to make sure it is free from defects,
    that there wasn’t, say, a forged document somewhere along the chain of ownership.

- en: Even in developed countries with relatively well-functioning land recording
    systems, there’s a chicken-and-egg problem. Depending on which U.S. state you
    live in, you’re subject to a standard title system, or Torrens system, in which
    the state essentially creates the registry and stands behind it. The first entry
    takes a lot of time to record, because each new entry requires a full record of
    all pertinent details. The second is simpler to administer, but it is harder to
    search for historical details such as liens and transfers. In some respects, a
    blockchain represents the automation of the abstract system, so as to arrive at
    a more searchable model of the Torrens system. But building a distributed ledger
    that way requires the accumulation of sales events to build up the record, which
    could take generations before it’s meaningful. The easier thing to do, then, for
    a reform-minded government, is to hire a startup that’s willing to go through
    the process of converting all of an existing registry, if one exists, into a digital
    format that can be recorded in a blockchain. Either way, obviously, there’s a
    lot of legwork involved.The impact of a distributed ledger for ownership records
    would be immense. The title insurance business, by which firms provide guarantees
    to homeowners that they’ll cover their losses if something faulty is later found
    with their property rights, would wither and die. Real estate investors forced
    to tie up large amounts of money in escrow for months on end would be able to

    on/off “kill” switch to regulate access to that power, a form of remotely executable
    “smart property” is created. If the system detects that digital currency payments
    have ceased, the smart contract would deactivate access to the power until payments
    are resumed, or could divert it into storage or to another part of the system
    in which payments are being made. This has potentially far-reaching implications

    customers, many of whom are confused by the demands placed upon them. Once again,

    fall back on the classic loan approval models of the traditional banking world.
    As such, inferior proofs of identity and subjective, poorly defined measures of
    creditworthiness become barriers to entry, especially once the dominant telecom
    providers use their privileged position as gatekeepers of these new e-monetary

    to automatically pay a third party if the value of their bitcoin rises above the
    original purchase price and to receive money if it falls below it. This so-called

  zh: 正在探索的一个领域是社区储蓄圈，其中最常见的形式是轮流储蓄和信贷协会，即ROSCAs。这些地方性项目在不同地区有不同的名称——例如印度的chit funds，印尼的arisans，拉丁美洲的tandas，西非和加勒比地区的’susu，中东的Game’ya，以及日本的tanomosiko——但它们共享一种基本方法。一群相互认识并信任的个人承诺定期向储蓄池中投入一定金额——比如，每月50美元。然后，储蓄池定期支付给该群体的一个成员，作为一种实际形式的信贷。每个人在此之后继续贡献，直到下一个支付传递给下一个人，依此类推。这个系统意味着每个人，在最后一个个体之外，实际上在某个时候得到了无息贷款。唯一的代价是在被支付后继续支付的责任。
- en: These systems have traditionally depended on the human trust that’s instilled
    in close friendship and kinship bonds. If everyone knows you, it’s much harder
    for you to stop meeting your obligations to the pool after you’ve received your
    payout. But that trust model imposes a physical constraint on scalability. Consider
    the Dunbar number—anthropologist Robin Dunbar’s theory that the highest number
    of stable relationships that any one person can sustain is 150\. By implication
    it means that a savings circle has to be quite small, because every member needs
    to have every other member of the group within their trusted set of 150 people,
    the probability of which decreases consistently as the group increases in size.

  zh: 这些系统传统上依赖于灌输在亲密友谊和亲属关系中的人类信任。如果每个人都认识你，那么在你收到支付后停止履行对池的义务就会更加困难。但这种信任模式对可扩展性施加了物理限制。考虑邓巴数——人类学家罗宾·邓巴的理论，即任何一个人能够维持的稳定关系的最高数量是150个。从含义上讲，这意味着储蓄圈必须相当小，因为每个成员都需要将群体中的每个其他成员视为其150人信任集的一部分，随着群体规模的增大，这种可能性会不断减小。
- en: Here’s where a blockchain, smart contracts, and tokens might come in. A startup
    called WeTrust, for whom Michael is an advisor, is using those technologies to
    add structure, automation, and token-based incentives to ROSCAs so that participants
    are compelled do the right thing. In effect, it could mean that new people can
    be added that aren’t as well known to everyone as in traditional ROSCAs. Unlike
    the KYC solution, which seeks smarter ways for people to prove who they are, this
    one lowers the barrier to entry by finding efficiencies in the system itself so
    that it’s less important to “know your customer.”

  zh: 这就是区块链、智能合约和代币可能发挥作用的地方。一家名为WeTrust的创业公司，Michael是他们的顾问，正在利用这些技术为ROSCAs增加结构、自动化和基于代币的激励，以便参与者被迫做正确的事情。实际上，这可能意味着可以添加一些不像传统ROSCAs中每个人都熟知的新人。与KYC解决方案不同，后者寻求更聪明的方法让人们证明自己是谁，这种解决方案通过找到系统本身的效率，降低进入门槛，以至于“了解您的客户”变得不那么重要。
- en: Whether WeTrust’s model works or not, it may help us learn a lot about how these
    new systems of algorithmic, distributed trust can interface with those old, deeply
    embedded social webs of trust. We think it’s important that solutions to the challenges
    faced by the poor aren’t just imposed in some cookie-cutter manner by Silicon
    Valley venture capitalists who insist they know best. Solutions must be informed
    by and tailored to the underlying cultural structures of the communities in question.

  zh: 无论WeTrust的模型是否有效，它都可能帮助我们了解这些新型算法、分布式信任系统如何与那些根深蒂固的社会信任网络接口。我们认为重要的是，解决贫困所面临挑战的方案不应该仅仅由硅谷风险投资家以某种套模板的方式强行施加，他们坚持认为自己知道最好。解决方案必须基于并且量身定制于相关社区的基础文化结构。
- en: And while we should be seeking solutions like WeTrust’s, which focuses on reducing
    the identification burden to achieve financial inclusion, the reality is that
    every culture has an identity system at its core. Dealing with identity is unavoidable.
    However, when we peel back the layers of what we mean by “identity,” as we will
    in the next chapter, we find that it is a highly contentious issue—one fraught
    with security risks and social tension in the Internet era. It’s an area in which
    some of the most radical ideas for blockchain applications are now being pursued.

  zh: 虽然我们应该寻求像WeTrust这样的解决方案，它专注于减少身份确认的负担以实现金融包容性，但现实是每种文化都有其核心的身份认同系统。处理身份是不可避免的。然而，当我们剥离我们所说的“身份”的各层含义（我们将在下一章讨论），我们发现这是一个极具争议的问题——在互联网时代充满了安全风险和社会紧张。这是一个领域，在其中一些最激进的区块链应用想法正在追求。
