    thousands of poor Bolivian immigrants. Many live in precarious dwellings prone
    to being swept away when the waters of the nearby Matanza River overflow. In the

    the housing is of a distinctly stronger foundation. The local school is in that

    families didn’t earn higher incomes than those in other parts of the neighborhood,

    they could use the deeds as collateral to borrow money to invest in businesses,

    all around the developing world who don’t have a title to their home. Their communities
    will acknowledge them as the owners but there’s nothing official saying so, nothing
    that’s accepted by the government or a bank, that is. Public registry systems
    in low-income countries are prone to corruption and incompetence—so a poor resident
    of a slum in a village in Uttar Pradesh or Manila might try to get a loan with
    their home as collateral, but no bank would accept it. Even wealthier homeowners
    run into frequent problems around the world—they’ll buy an apartment from a developer
    only to find that the businessman bribed the registrar to keep his name on the
    title. Proving ownership in such places is so precarious that banks are reluctant

    their unique private keys, it’s near impossible for one person to unilaterally

    It should be no surprise that some of the earliest non-currency applications of
    the blockchain focused on providing immutable notarization. One of the first to
    figure out that documents could be recorded and proven this way was Factom, an
    Austin, Texas, company that created an audit trail of financial documents’ changes,
    creating a model that, if it’s widely adopted, will eventually replace the whole
    industry of quarterly and annual accounting and auditing with something that happens
    in real time. Another player in this space is called, appropriately, Stampery.
    Stampery was founded by Luis Iván Cuende, a remarkable young Spanish entrepreneur
    who founded his first major software project at the age of twelve and at the age
    of twenty-one had amassed a reputation as one of the world’s most innovative hackers
    and developers. Stampery takes hashes of documents and records the trail of changes
    to them to the blockchain, providing valuable proof of status for companies involved
    in negotiations or litigation. It can help, for example, to keep track of multiple
    iterations and red-line changes that different lawyers and signatories might make
    to a contract through the evolution of a business deal.

    way than merely the authentication of documents and we can certainly take it beyond
    the stuffy world of lawyers and business deals. Consider the field of credit-scoring,

    amounts to doing due diligence to ensure they are creditworthy, has been prohibitively
    high across the developing world. The huge amount of time that’s needed to learn
    about someone who doesn’t have a paper trail of records and isn’t easily accessible,
    or doesn’t have an official ID, is too often more than it’s worth to issue a loan.
    Microfinance institutions—which provide small loans to the poor—have strived to
    solve the problem by sending dedicated volunteer credit officers out into the
    field to get to know people, vouch for them, and physically pick up and deliver
    cash for loan disbursement and repayment collection. But the personnel costs in
    this model just don’t scale. It perhaps shouldn’t have been a surprise that, sometime
    after Grameen Bank founder Muhammad Yunis won the Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering
    the microfinance industry, increasing default rates and a host of scandals shed

    Meni Rosenfeld. The idea was to take unique trusted, certified metadata about
    a real-world asset—perhaps the serial number on the chassis of a car or the geospatial
    coordinates of a piece of land—and associate it with a rightful owner who would
    have private key control over a bitcoin address. Bitcoin transactions include
    information fields, so that when the deed to a car is transferred from one person
    to another, the hash of that document can be inserted into a bitcoin transaction
    that’s validated by the mining network. (Here, the hashing process is similar
    to that which Bitcoin miners themselves do, as explained in chapter three, except
    that it is done by whoever holds the title to the asset, or is otherwise authorized
    to update information about it. Essentially, the text of a title document showing
    any changes to the assignment of rights and obligation, including the owner’s
    name as well as liens on the property, is run through a hashing algorithm that
    produces an alphanumeric string. That hash is then inserted into a blockchain
    transaction.)

    a vessel within which information about some right or claim is conveyed to the
    world. This is possible because, as we’ve discussed, cryptocurrency on a blockchain
    gives money a capacity that it doesn’t have in the traditional monetary system—it
    becomes programmable, able to communicate information and instructions. Note as
    well that the owner of such an asset need not only use this tool to send an asset
    to someone else; they could also make the transaction between two bitcoin addresses
    that they control, doing so solely to indelibly record the fact that they have
    a claim on a house, car, or other asset.

    startup called Chromaway that has a contract to register land titles in Sweden—was
    a significant breakthrough. It raised the prospect of tamper-proof asset registries,

    after you’ve put down your money for this part of the process? A title company
    searches through the property title’s history to make sure it is free from defects,
    that there wasn’t, say, a forged document somewhere along the chain of ownership.

    systems, there’s a chicken-and-egg problem. Depending on which U.S. state you
    live in, you’re subject to a standard title system, or Torrens system, in which
    the state essentially creates the registry and stands behind it. The first entry
    takes a lot of time to record, because each new entry requires a full record of
    all pertinent details. The second is simpler to administer, but it is harder to
    search for historical details such as liens and transfers. In some respects, a
    blockchain represents the automation of the abstract system, so as to arrive at
    a more searchable model of the Torrens system. But building a distributed ledger
    that way requires the accumulation of sales events to build up the record, which
    could take generations before it’s meaningful. The easier thing to do, then, for
    a reform-minded government, is to hire a startup that’s willing to go through
    the process of converting all of an existing registry, if one exists, into a digital
    format that can be recorded in a blockchain. Either way, obviously, there’s a
    lot of legwork involved.The impact of a distributed ledger for ownership records
    would be immense. The title insurance business, by which firms provide guarantees
    to homeowners that they’ll cover their losses if something faulty is later found
    with their property rights, would wither and die. Real estate investors forced
    to tie up large amounts of money in escrow for months on end would be able to

    of attestation. He’s asking village elders to decide who owns what in the village
    so that he can record the data in a digital registry—one that’s managed by his
    system, not a blockchain. The trick, though, is that he’s attached to their record
    a reputational scoring system designed to keep the elders honest. If they sign
    a piece of land over to their brother, or some livestock that’s not rightfully
    his, there’s a way for aggrieved parties to register their concerns through the
    scoring system. Akinyemi says he’s found a positive feedback loop where elders
    are now seeking recognition through positive reputation scores.

    that gets at a wider concept of property rights beyond land. He’s working to build
    a blockchain-based registry of the intellectual property of developing countries
    rich in biodiversity, starting with a project in concert with the government of
    Mauritius. The idea is that by pre-registering natural assets in rainforests and
    other biochemistry-rich places and then recording them in a blockchain as a property
    claim on behalf of local communities, those communities can better assert their
    rights. That way, they can’t be as easily exploited by foreign pharmaceutical
    and cosmetic companies, which have lodged countless patents based on the extraction
    of materials in such places over the years. The concept is only loosely formed
    at this stage but we raise it here to point out that the assets a blockchain can
    register go far beyond land. In fact, other assets may be much easier to quantify,
    with less politics and less ambiguity over ownership.

    could include commodities, accounts receivable, equipment, as well as land. The
    team’s first test application is aimed at providing poor farmers in developing
    countries with an immutable receipt for crops deposited at a warehouse. Warehouse
    receipts are an integral part of any country’s management of trade in agriculture.
    But in developing countries, banks have long been unwilling to accept them as
    collateral as the banks can’t be sure that the receipts, often issued on flimsy,
    easily duplicated paper in poorly monitored facilities, haven’t been pledged to
    other lenders to create competing liens. The blockchain can assure that only one
    receipt has been generated for each deposit of crops and can keep an immutable
    record of how much of the deposit has been pledged and to whom. It’s yet another
    way that blockchains prevent double-spending.

    a model that would capture usage rights to energy generated in a communally owned
    microgrid as a way to funnel collateralized financing to off-grid communities
    that don’t have well-established legal and property title systems. Already, a
    team composed of IoT startup Filament, Nasdaq, and a team from IDEO Colab has
    found a way to integrate signals from a smart meter device with a blockchain so
    as to prove that a uniquely identified photovoltaic panel has produced and delivered
    a verifiable, measurable amount of solar power. In effect, that proven flow of
    power could be registered as a kind of certified claim to solar energy, which
    can then be traded or collateralized. Then, if we were to connect a device such
    as Filament’s with a digital payments and smart-contract system, along with an
    on/off “kill” switch to regulate access to that power, a form of remotely executable
    “smart property” is created. If the system detects that digital currency payments
    have ceased, the smart contract would deactivate access to the power until payments
    are resumed, or could divert it into storage or to another part of the system
    in which payments are being made. This has potentially far-reaching implications
    in the world of finance.

    over your energy grid to a decentralized algorithm. But once all parties agree
    to the contract and acknowledge that the blockchain’s neutrality assures that
    its terms and conditions will be carried out as agreed, this model could help
    supplement an otherwise flawed legal system, and so proactively lower the cost
    of financing in such places.

    Now imagine that that secured loan could be bundled with other loans to microgrids—some
    from microfinance institutions, some from credit unions, others from local banks—into
    pools of securitized “crypto-solar” financial assets that could be sold to investment
    houses and bigger institutions. A blockchain is vital in this because it can allow
    a level of granularity and micromanagement of the investment and energy flows
    that’s simply not possible in a non-digital world, where the lack of transparency

    prospect for financial inclusion stems from the rapid expansion of mobile phone
    usage in the developing world and—with that—of mobile money systems. Following
    the trailblazing launch of M-Pesa in Kenya in 2007, there are now ninety-three
    countries with some form of mobile-money services, with 271 “live” deployments,
    and 101 more planned. But many are still only scratching the surface of the potential
    market. In fact, the statistics belie a deeper problem. “Between 60 percent and
    90 percent of [mobile] accounts opened by new banking customers fall dormant almost
    immediately without a single transaction,” writes mobile payments expert Carol
    Realini. Why? Most of these systems are still based on an underlying banking infrastructure,
    and the banks that run them don’t have a good handle on the needs of “unbanked”
    customers, many of whom are confused by the demands placed upon them. Once again,
    the obsession with being “banked” and the divide between those who strive to be
    allowed into this hallowed space and those who deny them that opportunity stand
    as a barrier. Banks, too often, are actually the problem—or at least the regulatory
    and risk-management model in which they operate is the problem. Maybe getting
    people into them shouldn’t be the goal at all.

    paradigm is a hindrance. Once credit is involved, mobile money platforms like
    M-Pesa, which must be backed in aggregate by each country’s financial system,
    fall back on the classic loan approval models of the traditional banking world.
    As such, inferior proofs of identity and subjective, poorly defined measures of
    creditworthiness become barriers to entry, especially once the dominant telecom
    providers use their privileged position as gatekeepers of these new e-monetary
    systems to charge exorbitant fees. The mobile providers, including Kenya’s Safaricom,
    are reluctant to make their systems interoperable with other providers, ensuring
    that cross-telecom and cross-border exchanges must go through the African banking
    system, which is inefficient, cumbersome, and expensive. These localized mobile
    money solutions are nothing like the open, permissionless innovation platforms
    that blockchain and Bitcoin purists dream of. It means that while the unbanked
    poor can now more easily send payments to each other, at least within the closed
    loops of their local telecom, the problems of the banking system’s exclusionary
    model still affect them—especially when they need credit, which they often do
    in times of emergency. Unable to prove who they are, what they do, and what they
    own, the poor continue to be at the mercy of loan sharks, who do as much as anyone

    a reputation among the general public for criminality. This was intensified by
    the massive “WannaCry” ransomware attacks of 2017 in which attackers broke into

    out how to minimize their own risk in briefly holding bitcoin, which lets them
    pass on affordable rates to their customers, who only deal in their local currencies.
    The approach is paying dividends, as evident in the recent success of BitPesa,
    which was established in 2013 and was profiled in The Age of Cryptocurrency. The
    company, which offers cross-border payments and foreign-exchange transactions

    growth, taking its transaction volume to $10 million midway through 2017, up from

    With Abra, the user buys bitcoin but the app removes the volatility risk by deploying
    a high-tech hedging system that takes advantage of the transparency and low transaction
    costs of blockchain transactions. Without the user needing to even think about
    it, the app uses a blockchain-managed smart contract system to commit their account
    to automatically pay a third party if the value of their bitcoin rises above the
    original purchase price and to receive money if it falls below it. This so-called
    contract-for-difference, which is a bit like a foreign exchange option, has the
    effect of locking in the value of the underlying bitcoin. All the customer sees
    on their screen is the fiat-currency value—say, in dollars—that they initially
    transferred into their Abra account. When a San Francisco–based Filipino immigrant
    sends money to a family member in Manila, the same process will begin with the
    Philippines-based person’s smartphone, albeit in a contract involving bitcoin
    and Philippine pesos. This system is only possible because the use of the blockchain

    that manage the traditional business of derivatives trading. It creates a much

    business signs on a new customer, they are supposed to “know” and be comfortable
    with the risks that customer poses—as defined, rather ambiguously, by who they
    are. It hinges on that old state-centric notion of ID, against which potential
    red flags, such as no-fly-list citations, would supposedly be attached. If you

    into a savings pool periodically—say, $50 per month. Then, the pool is periodically
    paid out to one member of the group, as a de facto form of credit. Everyone keeps
    contributing after that, until another payout is delivered to the next in line,
    and so on. This system means that everyone, with the exception of the last individual,

    the Dunbar number—anthropologist Robin Dunbar’s theory that the highest number
    of stable relationships that any one person can sustain is 150\. By implication
    it means that a savings circle has to be quite small, because every member needs
    to have every other member of the group within their trusted set of 150 people,
    the probability of which decreases consistently as the group increases in size.
