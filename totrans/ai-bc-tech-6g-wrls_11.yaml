- en: When it comes to the use of new technology, the pharmaceutical industry has
    undergone many transformations. Operational issues and counterfeit drugs are two
    of the most commonly encountered challenges in the pharmaceutical industry; the
    solution is to provide authenticate vigilance to track pharmaceutical products
    from starting of production to consumption for avoiding further financial losses.
    Due to blockchain's streamlined nature for keeping total confidentiality and efficiency
    to the traditional method; it has the potential to resolve it and speed up the
    process by emerging 6G wireless network. Despite the fact that blockchain-based
    systems offer many benefits across the pharmaceutical industry, the adoption rate
    of blockchain technology remains somewhat low due to the lack of knowledge, awareness,
    and the lack of understanding that why, how, and where blockchain technology with
    6G is required in their domains. This chapter explains blockchain technology,
    the benefits of a blockchain-based system and how it enhances the overall efficiency
    of pharmaceutical industries by integrating 6G wireless networks.

    with complete automation by integrating wireless network characteristics from
    the ground, air, space and undersea. 6G is anticipated to achieve 607 Exabytes
    for each month around 2025 and 5016 Exabytes around 2030, due to substantial volumes
    of data traffic and new multimedia technologies. There's a need to hook up a vast
    group of ubiquitously connected heterogeneous devices (e.g. pharmaceutical manufacturing
    organizational structure, along with the internet of things, to help enable a
    variety of network facilities) is driving the need for 6G communication systems
    to be almost virtualized, software designated, and cloud-based structures [[1](#CR1),
    [2](#CR2)]. However, this goal is hampered by a variety of trust-related challenges
    that are typically disregarded in network architectures. Blockchain, a fresh and
    imaginative technology that has arisen in the previous decade, provides a feasible
    solution. Because of its decentralization, transparency, anonymity, immutability,
    traceability, and resiliency, blockchain can foster cooperative trust within and
    between separate network elements and promote, for example, effective resource
    sharing, trusted data interaction, secure access control, privacy protection,
    and tracing, certification, and supervision functionalities for wireless networks

- en: Blockchain technology is an electronic ledger or series of blocks connected
    together via encryption. These blocks include data in the form of the block header
    and the block (which contains data); the coupling of blocks forms the chain, which
    contains knowledge regarding the current block as well as the address of some
    other blocks (Fig. [1](#Fig1)). Blockchain creates a data structure through the
    orderly connection of nodes. This approach was invented in 1991 as the “digital
    documentation” of such contents. Initially, the application of blockchain technology
    was highly limited and quite infrequent. With the debut of bitcoin, a platform
    for digital money (cryptocurrency) invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, which advanced
    the usage of blockchain technology, blockchain technology attracted extensive
    attention in 2009 [[4](#CR4)]. A blockchain technology is a form of database that
    is built to be read only once, according to its designs and specifications. Data
    is maintained in a blockchain decentralized network and is a transactional sort
    of information, therefore the owner owns the private key to ensure that no one
    else may access it [[5](#CR5)]. In addition, the owner has access to the Inter
    Planetary File System (IPFS). When it comes to health care, the operation of blockchain
    technology is the reality that the extension of traditional healthcare information
    systems includes a variety of operations such as, but not limited to, having recovery
    mechanisms in place, performing backup storage services, and clinching up-to-date
    fields. Since the information in blockchain technology is disseminated over the
    whole linked network with no single point of failure, an entrenched backup mechanism
    is created [[6](#CR6)]. Furthermore, a solo version of content is duplicated across
    every node of the blockchain (Fig. [1](#Fig1)), which minimizes the volume of
    interactions involving information systems and thus factors for decreasing the
    pressure on the healthcare environment.![](../images/517376_1_En_11_Chapter/517376_1_En_11_Fig1_HTML.png)

    of digital data are the big concern with respect to growing data all over the
    world considering today’s expanding digital era [[7](#CR7)]. Blocks in blockchain
    are the growing index of data and these blocks are logically linked together with
    each other using cryptography. Maintaining adequate accuracy and preventing the
    degradation of critical data; each block contains a timestamp (to validate the
    existence of the transaction), a cryptographic hash (hashing value for every connected
    block is much like a "digital fingerprint" that guarantees block confidentiality
    and is always unique for each block for supplying encrypted data and reliability),
    and transaction data [[8](#CR8)]. Generally, Merkle tree is used to represent
    transaction data. One more benefit is data modification resistivity since each
    block contains the knowledge about the block which one is previous to it and concertedly
    all form a chain as shown in Fig. [1](#Fig1). The block after each additional
    block fortifies its predecessor block, this strictly restricts the alteration
    of data without altering all subsequent blocks. Peer-to-peer channels are used
    to administer and govern blockchains, which serve as just a publicly distributed
    ledger [[9](#CR9)]. Blockchain is a publicly distributed ledger in which nodes
    follow a mechanism to validate and interact with new nodes. There is no need for
    a centralized server or system to store blockchain data. The distributed data
    was carried out by millions of blockchain machines all around the world. Data
    may be notarized on these computers since it resides on each and every node and
    is openly able to be verified. Blockchain technology is built on three pillars:
    decentralization, transparency, and immutability. The brief description that how
    blockchain works and information flows is shown in Fig. [2](#Fig2).![](../images/517376_1_En_11_Chapter/517376_1_En_11_Fig2_HTML.png)'

- en: The concept of blockchain technology appeared in actuality across a white paper,
    which was written by Nakamoto as stated before. Nakamoto's main plan was to establish
    a permissionless system capable of solving the double-spending challenge by leveraging
    peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology to produce computational proof of transactions
    in a sequential manner [[9](#CR9)]. As previously said, blockchain refers to a
    network of blocks, each of which stores a gathering of information about the history,
    present, and future. As quickly as a block enters the system and becomes a member
    of the chain, it plays a critical function in connecting with the previous and
    subsequent blocks. Each block's critical role is to distribute, verify, and record
    transactions across other blocks [[11](#CR11)]. This also has the advantage of
    not allowing a block in any chain to be changed or deleted because doing so would
    lead to significant change in every subsequent block. As a result, the blockchain
    network is a decentralized information system that contains information about
    all previous transactions and is managed by a preselected protocol that interprets
    the direction of validating and completing transactions, as well as the functioning
    of its members and the entire network. Furthermore, because the information is
    held on each node controlling each of the various networks, this sort of network
    is sometimes referred to as a distributed register. A transaction group in blockchain
    networks combines blocks of transactions interlinked on the chain by using hashing
    of the preceding block's record. As a result, the core security element of different
    blockchains, a particular set of characteristics, is imposed. Therefore, more
    information is provided to a block by the edge of the link (the older it is),
    the more it is protected against alterations. Even when an attacker tries to change
    any of the keys, the regional registry will become invalid immediately. This result
    will be obtained also because hash values are stored domestically within the next
    block's header so will be completely different depending on the hash function
    methods [[12](#CR12)].

    access types based on: public, private, and consortium. Anyone can gain inclusion
    and participation in yet another transacting party using public blockchain technologies.
    Therefore, it does not imply that transactions would have limited confidentiality
    because public blockchain uses consensus techniques [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)].
    Private blockchain technology allows only authorized parties to connect to a network.
    Rare beneficiaries can sometimes be constrained for those that have been preapproved
    over an acceptable blockchain. Furthermore, multiple levels of access to the data
    in the database can also be allowed to individuals. Private blockchain incorporates
    a high degree of security and privacy. A sole central authority determines the
    consensus mechanisms in the private blockchain [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)]. Consortium
    blockchains facilitate most users to access content, but then only a few have
    the right to write toward the blocks. Consortium blockchain encourages openness,
    partnership, coordination, and promotes loyalty [[15](#CR15)]. Similarly, there
    are conceptions of open and closed blockchain technology considerably away from
    public, private, and consortium blockchain technology. The terminology public
    and private blockchain indicates the level of accessibility that users have to
    insert data to the blockchain, while open and closed blockchain refers to the
    amount of access that users have to read the data from the blockchain [[16](#CR16)].

    medications passing via distributors, re-packagers, and wholesalers prior to actually
    reaching the buyer. Manufacturers have very little transparency over the legitimacy
    of their products across the supply chain. The counterfeit medication issues,
    as well as pharmaceutical arbitrage prospects, are two major challenges inside
    the pharmaceutical supply chain. Healthcare items some of which are offered well
    with the goal to misrepresent their source are known as counterfeit medications.
    Counterfeit medications may have insufficient amounts of active substances, unlabeled
    chemicals, or no active component at all. The cost of counterfeiting medicine
    is substantial, and it may lead to treatment failure, medical issues, poisoning,
    fatality, financial loss, and even a crisis of confidence there in the healthcare
    system. Pharmaceutical arbitrage is an issue that occurs whenever authorities,
    for instance, provide funding for costlier yet life-saving treatments to somehow
    be supplied at a cheaper price through a plan to enlarge patient access to healthcare.
    When medications are obtained at a cheap cost with the purpose of selling them
    to patients at a massive cost, arbitrage possibilities are utilized. Pharmaceutical
    arbitrage reduces reasonable prices, obstructs access to medications and health
    care, and costs the government funds [[27](#CR27)].

    The benefit of blockchain is that information is secured from unwanted alteration.
    This has a significant impact on the economic system. The degree of trust grows
    with sixth-generation wireless technology, which is expected to introduce new

    Economic efficiency improves as a result. In the instance of the pharmaceutical
    business, these beneficial impacts are examined. The use of blockchain technology
    in pharmaceuticals allows for the tracking of medications at all stages of manufacture
    and the assurance of their quality. With the aid of sophisticated digital devices,

- en: 6G networks will feature a huge network of devices that connect homes, communities,
    and industries with multiple data transactions. To ensure safe data transport,
    devices must have mutual trust. To establish such trust and security, the blockchain
    lets each node keep a sequential ledger (chain of blocks) in which each user who
    modifies data within a block is accessible to and validated by everyone else to
    avoid fabrication. To preserve transparency, each data block must be confirmed
    in relation to the prior blocks by the other participating users. The dependability
    component is added among all users in this manner; nevertheless, privacy is compromised
    because all changes are accessible to everybody. The decentralized nature of blockchain
    allows for greater flexibility while lowering administrative costs. In a densely
    linked mesh network, the blockchain provides various benefits, including security,
    dependability, trust, and scalability. A video conference call or mixed reality-based
    video streaming, for example, might be an example of a blockchain in 6G networks,
    where the network, in addition to providing connection, also needs all parties
    to verify themselves and the data being transferred using specialized blockchains.
    This will include data properties knowledge to analyze anomalous activities in
    real time. However, aside from the large device connections, there are additional
    problems in 6G networks for blockchain implementation, such as resource constraints
    on devices that limit the breadth of usage of cryptographic security methods on
    the device. Similarly, data packets must be subjected to a thorough examination
    to assess danger, which becomes a monumental effort when the number of devices
    is large. Security assaults are more accessible due to the lack of third-party
    verification, as half of the total participants are compromised [[45](#CR45)].

    in some way or another, but at a varying scale of the next generation of the network.
    Every pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholder; stock core business informational
    content in the distributed ledger of blockchain that allows everyone to access
    sensitive private data leads to losing competitive advantage when many competitors
    exist in the same supply chain. This distributed ledger technology is one of the
    most radical innovation enablers for tackling most current limitations and aiding
    6G functional standards. Solutions and platforms based on blockchain lack full
    interoperability due to the absence of standardized solutions to turn implementation,
    integration, and adaptability easier. The role of regulatory agencies, in blockchain-based
    solutions, becomes more complex and pertinent. This becomes difficult for these
    groups of institutions to interpret the environment and the legal limits of blockchain
    technology. Due to the generation of undeveloped practices and controls, recent
    blockchain frameworks are exposing intrinsic bugs and vulnerabilities [[48](#CR48)].

    data on the blockchain can only be accessed via a "key," which is a one-of-a-kind
    pattern of letters and integers. When a key is lost, the content containing the
    information accesses is irreversibly lost, and cannot retrieve back. It is unconscionable
    to restrict access to a lifetime''s worth of medical records due to the loss of
    one of these keys and methods must be created to rejoin individuals with the information.
    Solutions reportedly in use offer backdoors to accessing blockchain-based personal
    information essentially repurposing the problem. A further issue is that if the
    federalism of a blockchain is broken, such as if one company gains majority control
    of servers (more than two-thirds with current enterprise mechanism), one agent

    provenance data, data protection, proprietary information, cost benefits, serialization,
    verification, audit ability, recognition, effectiveness, spontaneously, immutable,
    consensus-driven, as well as sustainability are success factors in the pharmaceutical
    firm''s deployment of blockchain-based technology. With a decentralized, transparent,
    regulated, and safe method, blockchain operates on the basic phenomena of no repetition
    and symmetry of the item. In the pharmaceutical supply chain, the blockchain idea
    may be used to identify fraudulent medications by maintaining required drugs’
    supply and demand that allow Pharma businesses for keeping track of counterfeit
    and unlicensed drugs. Because the drug companies are typically chaotic and splintered,
    the presence of numerous suppliers in the supply chain adds to drug quality control
    issues. The following are the inferred benefits of blockchain innovation for fostering
    positive network administration: reducing overall mischaracterization and discrepancies,
    unnecessary delays from hard copies with the integration of 6G, enhancing stock
    control, recognizing troubles more speedily, curbing dispatch expenditure, and
    ramping up consumer and trust companions. Blockchain methods are currently being
    used in the pharma firm in the form of beginning and research initiatives. Yet,
    the author predicts the emergence of localized, nationwide, and maybe global communications
    systems are expected future as expertise and expertise get more inexpensive, hence
    increasing their presence. All such solutions will be linked to the networking
    via distributed databases of accurate statistics from medication designers and
    manufacturers, suppliers, pharmacies, clinics, and consumers, as well as state
    and international legislative and governing bodies for the pharmaceutical industry
    sector. In terms of expense remedy, non-repudiation, converging among pervasive
    computing, and use of trace ability to check unlawful actions damaging the sustainability
    charter; blockchain technology is an emergent distributed guarantee. A smart contract
    is a fundamental component of blockchain technology that reduces negative external
    elements during production, improves the quality of life, promotes employability,
    and improves social and environmental performance across a wide variety of applications
    related to the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to supporting economic performance.
    The usage of blockchain in 6G use case applications is predicted to develop, bringing
    benefits to intelligent living and firm segments by reducing safety concerns and

    Peercoin was the first cryptocurrency to implement PoS in 2012\. Cardano is the
    most valuable proof-of-stake blockchain in terms of market capitalization.

    systems were created with PBFT in the account. It is designed to have a reduced
    overhead time. Its purpose was to address a number of issues with existing Byzantine
    Fault Tolerance methods. Distributed computing and blockchain are two examples
    of application areas. It initiates the PBFT consensus network''s three phases:
    pre-prepare, prepare, and commit. The header node multicasts a pre-prepared message
    to other nodes in the PBFT network during the pre-prepare phase.'

- en: DBFT is a consensus technique that many blockchains and cryptocurrency adopters
    are unfamiliar with. NEO, dubbed the "Ethereum of China," launched the Delegated
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus. By digitizing assets and establishing smart
    contracts on the blockchain, this Chinese blockchain aims to create a "smart economy."
    DBFT's voting approach, similar to Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus, enables
    large-scale involvement, according to its inventors. Absolute finality is one
    of the main advantages of adopting the DBFT process.

- en: A block cannot be bifurcated after final confirmation; hence the transaction
    cannot be cancelled or rolled back. However, this is a two-sided weapon. The fact
    that NEO is not a completely decentralized network ensures the network's finality.
    Despite NEO's efforts in this area, the blockchain currently has only seven nodes
    and a few delegates in operation. The majority are linked to the NEO council.

    to boost reliability, improve productivity, reduce overall production errors,
    and raise stakeholder expectations for medicine efficacy. The use of IoT in pharmaceutical
    manufacturing, distribution network (supply chain), clinical development, and
    patient engagement not only helps to reduce the time to market for medications,
    but it also aids in the discovery of flaws throughout the value chain via real-time
    data feed, which aids in regulatory compliance.
