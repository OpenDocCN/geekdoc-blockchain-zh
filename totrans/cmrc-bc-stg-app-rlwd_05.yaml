    different tasks. I believe that we need to work in a hybrid world where the Blockchain
    networks are interoperable and work together. Over the next few years, we will
    see many more Blockchain networks and DLTs – all of these need to work together
    as the unique characteristics of each network, complementing each other and enabling
    a significant ecosystem of many different solutions.

- en: A fundamental part of building the Blockchain technology is the approach to
    consensus – this is where you need to understand that with Blockchain databases,
    you verify transactions WHEN they are entered into the Blockchain, whereas with
    a normal database, you reconcile and audit the transaction AFTER the transaction
    is entered into the database.

    is verified on entry and therefore all records of that data are final and cannot
    be changed.
