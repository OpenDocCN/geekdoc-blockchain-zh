    a break from mining and deployment and talk about some of the design choices that
    went into Ethereum: specifically, those around its system of economic incentives
    and disincentives. Broadly speaking, this facet of Ethereum overlaps with the
    field of game theory, the study of rational, intelligent decision-making in situations
    involving conflict and cooperation.Game theory is used in economics, defense planning,
    psychology, political science, biology, and even the study of gambling (!) as
    a methodology for studying, analyzing, and predicting the behavior of humans and
    computers working inside a known system.This book is about understanding the purpose
    of the Ethereum network, and how to get connected to it. We’re fortunate that
    we don’t have to be mathematicians to do so. If you happen to be one, and you’d
    like a more technical explanation of the concepts in this brief but important
    chapter, consult the Ethereum White Paper and Yellow Paper, located at the following

    sending coded messages, but the study of cryptography became formalized as a discipline
    only within the decades since World War II. During that war, Allied powers were
    able to intercept and crack enciphered messages transmitted in Morse code by the
    Axis powers Enigma machine, a factor that General Dwight D. Eisenhower considered
    decisive in the Allied victory.[¹](#Fn1)Today, with digital communications, we
    don’t have to rely on transmission over the fuzzy analog radio spectrum, where
    information can fade in and out with the hiss and jumble of interference. We get
    crisp, clear, digital signals across many devices and protocols. The digital communication
    age we know today was ushered in by cryptanalysis , also known as code-breaking
    . The new field of information theory that resulted from it made modern computers,
    computer languages, and networking into reality, decades after they were envisioned
    by futurist inventors.

    of those signals private to the sender and recipient, even when messages travel

    equipped with a spying apparatus.To secure the information they send across networks,
    today’s computers can encrypt information with far greater strength than the Enigma

    in an untrustworthy environment, or under any circumstances where your information
    is prone to exploitation or destruction. War is one example, but so are industrial
    espionage, religious persecution, or even natural disasters.The field of economics
    typically studies interactions between people, sometimes in hostile contexts such
    as war. The emerging field of cryptoeconomics is the study of economic activity

    defense between public networks and attackers of all sizes. It combines game theoretical
    system design, encryption, and cryptographic hashing to protect a commonly used,
    commonly operated resource—in this case, a global transaction state machine.Because
    public chains are public, they need to be resilient against attackers with large
    amounts of computing power. Hence, networks with more nodes, and more geographically
    distributed nodes, owned by discrete unlinked owners, are considered more secure.Mining
    pools contribute to centralization, which is why any pool with larger than 25
    percent hashpower is approaching the threshold of network threat. Should two such
    pools emerge, they might quickly get control of a network.By using the custom,
    ASIC-resistant Ethash algorithm and designing the network to quickly increase
    in difficulty, the protocol designers ensured there would be little incentive
    for miners to professionalize and consolidate.

    of pop-up ingredient tray for the proof-of-work algorithm, which hashes together
    chunks of data from the DAG in order to look for a winning nonce value that will

    Ethereum and Bitcoin accounts use a pair of cryptographic keys, one public and
    one private, to encrypt transactions sent to their respective virtual machines.
    (Both networks use the same algorithm called secp256k1 curve to perform encryption.)
    Recall that this is known as public-key encryption, also known as asymmetric encryption
    . This is in contrast to symmetric encryption , in which both parties share a
    public and private key, much the way you and a spouse might share an address and
    have duplicate house keys.The symmetric encryption pattern is the one used by
    most servers today. When servers communicate, they often use the same private
    key to authenticate each other. This is safe only if you trust the server on the
    other end of the transaction to keep this private key, which is presumably of
    mutual value to both parties, secret from any saboteur.Encryption turns a human-readable
    string of letters or numbers into an unreadable blob of random letters and numbers
    with one important caveat. The ciphertext that comes out of encryption algorithms
    does not have a fixed length.Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) are popular algorithms for doing this. The RSA encryption algorithm
    is another widely-used standard in IT departments around the world. However, sometimes
    public keys generated by these popular encryption algorithms can be very long
    and unwieldy. Ethereum uses the same elliptic-curve-based encryption protocol
    as Bitcoin, also known as an ECDSA algorithm, which has the advantage of both
    security and brevity: ECDSA allows for a smaller key size, which reduces storage
    needs and transmission requirements. However, Vitalik Buterin has said the protocol
    will likely move away from the current implementation of ECDSA in the future,
    towards something offering even greater security.'

    CPU-intensive. For another, private keys may be cryptographically secure, but
    they aren’t impervious to human folly. Private keys must be carefully managed.
    In fact, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidelines
    for the life cycle of cryptographic keys, based on the sensitivity of the data
    or keys to be protected, and how much data (or how many key pairs) are being protected.[²](#Fn2)It
    should be noted that, if you don’t want anyone to decode your message, encryption
    is not your best choice. The existence of a private key is practically begging
    for your information to someday be unlocked, presumably by you, but also by anyone
    who gets ahold of it!

    no private key that can “reverse” a hash back into its original, readable form.
    Thus, if a machine doesn’t need to know the contents of a dataset, it should be
    given the hash of the dataset instead.Hashing algorithms take in data just like
    encryption algorithms, but they produce a string or number of fixed length. Changing
    just one character in a large dataset will cause the hash to come out completely
    different. It’s basically impossible to put hashed data back into its original
    form. Popular hashing algorithms include MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2\. Ethereum and
    Bitcoin protocols both use SHA-256, the strongest hashing algorithm out there.

    it’s probably because you’ve seen them in your smartphone or computer’s network
    interface when connecting to Wi-Fi and entering a password. Because hashes are
    one-way by nature, they’re great for comparing two secret values without revealing
    what they are. Thus, if your computer hashes the Wi-Fi password and hands it to
    the Wi-Fi router—which knows the password—it should hash the password itself and
    get the same result. This confirms that you have the right password and are allowed
    to connect. The advantage here is that anyone snooping on the network never sees
    the password, only the hash.

    15 seconds, to be exact. Many of the subroutines in the mining process are engineered
    to maintain that block time. However, we haven’t stopped to ask whether that block
    time is “better” than Bitcoin’s 10-minute blocks, or whether it is merely characteristic
    of the way the Ethereum protocol works.One fact you should know is the latency
    for Bitcoin nodes around the world. About 95 percent of them can be reached in
    12.6 seconds, as measured by an academic team in 2013.[³](#Fn3) This number is
    proportional to block size, so in a “faster” block time currency, you could have
    a more responsive network.However, fast blocks are less secure in the near term,
    for reasons that we won’t get into here. But in their favor, they produce fast
    confirmation times; in order words, they benefit from more granularity of information.
    Thus, while nodes may be easier to fool initially, they are drawn powerfully toward
    the “true” chain within a few generations. The idea that faster blocks are proportionally
    less secure than slower blocks is false.To read more about how the speed of block

    percent was allocated to the Ethereum Foundation, and another 10 percent was maintained
    as a reserve at the time of the presale.)From the presale forward, the system
    will issue 15.6 million ether per year in the form of rewards paid to miners.
    Ether never stops being issued, but the amount issued per year is a smaller and
    smaller percentage of the overall pool. As you can see in Figure [7-1](#Fig1),
    the small uptick in the curved line at 2014–2015 indicates the presale period.![A433414_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg](A433414_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
