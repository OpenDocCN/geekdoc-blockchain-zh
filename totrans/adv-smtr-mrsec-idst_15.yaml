- en: Gardening is a nice activity. It is not possible to monitor and tend to a garden
    24 hours a day, so we need a smart gardening system that can monitor and tend
    to the garden as we want it. In today's busy world, we forget to nourish and water
    plants that make our home clean and soothing. It would be really helpful if we
    get a notification on our phones about our plant health and needs. Taking account
    of this, the authors came up with the idea of building a smart garden with an
    IoT plant monitoring system. After the data is processed and verified, a notification
    is sent about the plant's health. An automated gardening system is designed to
    enable us to manage gardening, including monitoring moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. This chapter is on an IoT-based smart garden monitoring system which
    senses the requirement of the plant and provides it with water as the soil loses
    its moisture. Thing-speak and Blynk application are used to view sensor data from
    remote locations.

    mobile phones in monitoring and controlling the simple parameters of day to day
    life. The standard of our life will be nourished by the practice of using automation
    for simple things. Using the concept of IOT we make sensors to communicate with
    each other which are powerful in automation. The important aspect of this prototype
    is that it saves cost and ensures safety. When people try to make plantings and
    set up their own garden, they were cautious in maintenance at only in their beginning
    stages. As days go on due to lack of maintenance the plants get destroyed. This
    prototype will help people to automatically monitor the parameters and ensures
    maintenance of the garden. It plays a vital role and serves as a good companion
    for plants. IOT provides solutions for various problems and it allows things to
    be sensed or controlled remotely in network infrastructure.

    a smart indoor gardening system that links gardening activities and the IoT technology.
    The benefits of gardening have been emphasized to improve the quality of life.
    However, a number of reasons due to a lack of gardening culture and apartment
    housing systems limit personal gardening in Korea. Thus, indoor gardening has
    been paid attention as an alternative, but it is still a challenge. Previous studies
    and practices have shown that the IoT technology can be applied to numerous occasions,
    and can feasibly provide a solution to these gardening issues. This paper proposes
    a possible smart indoor gardening system to cope with the issues.

- en: We have successfully made a food quality monitoring system using NodeMCU and
    Blynk cloud platform. This system blinks an LED if the readings of temperature
    and humidity go beyond the set threshold. Several such sensors can be placed in
    go-downs and storage containers to be of practical application. This system will
    help keep food at optimal levels of temperature and humidity and increase the
    shelf life of the plants. The implementation of Smart Garden system using the
    Internet of Things has been verified to satisfactorily work by connecting different
    parameters of the soil to the cloud and was successfully controlled remotely through
    a mobile application. The system designed not only monitors the sensor data, like
    moisture, humidity, temperature and ultrasonic but also actuates other parameters
    according to the requirement, for example, if the water level in tank is reduced
    to a minimum value then the motor switch is turned on automatically to the water
    level of the tank reaches the maximum value. The initial cost and the installation
    of this system are cheap and hence it can be implemented anywhere. With the development
    of sensor technology, the system can be elevated to the next level which helps
    the users to utilize their investment in an economic manner. If soil nutrient
    sensors can be installed, then the system can be modified to supply fertilizers
    to the garden precisely. This system saves manpower and efficiently utilizes the
    water resources available ultimately leading to more profit. The feedback provided
    by the system will improve the implementation of the gardening process.

    smart gardening monitoring techniques. We could also create an app interfacing
    with our project to provide a more immersive and better experience.
