    will transform our lives over the next 20 years. We are only at the beginning
    of the revolution – maybe at 0.8 or 0.9 at the moment, but we will move quickly

    these are where the world needs to focus – changes are difficult for humans and
    we need to be open to this new technology, which will give us more trust and transparency
