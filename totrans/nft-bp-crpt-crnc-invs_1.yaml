    blockchain. Unlike tokens created with the ERC-20 standard, each token created

    tokens. Since each ERC-721 token is different from each other and is not of the
    same value, it is more difficult to exchange tokens with each other.

    on top of the Ethereum platform as ERC-721tokens. You can find other tokens under
    NFT, with different standards and other protocols and blockchain, for example,
    on NEO or EOS, but ERC-721 is currently the most popular standard of NFT. The
    ERC-721 has a set of standard features and attributes that define it in the form
    of a smart contract. You need to follow these attributes and features to own,
    trade and manage the ERC-721\. Simply put, the ERC-721 provides us with a standard
    for creating and exchanging NFTs. Each ERC-721 marker is unique in that it does
    not belong to ERC-20 markers.

    of a lot of transactions, allowing different types of items to be transferred
    faster, cheaper and lighter (within the scope of the data size area covered within
    the block). For example, this is an example of erc-1155 when you buy individual
    items with ERC-20 and ERC-721 on in-game purchases on a blockchain and NFT gaming
    platform, but instead of buying them on a single standard in a single erc-1155
    single transaction.

    argues that this new set of standards is good for the blockchain-based gaming
    industry and is also a good option for creating tokens for all forms of ownership,

    because an NFT product is not divisible in reciprocal transfer transactions. You
    cannot exchange one NFT for another. Whether they are collectables, gaming, or
    any other type of NFT, they can't be interchanged. With cryptos, you can always
    exchange one crypto for its equivalent in another crypto – for example, you can
    exchange 1 BTC for it equivalent in ETH or any other crypto.

    artificially maintain their NFTs in limited supply. NFT markets will create liquidity

    value here, individuals will be able to buy fungible tokens by donating NFT tokens,

    characteristic of NFTs. As we've mentioned above, NFTs cannot be interchanged
    with one another due to their uniqueness. No one NFT can be made other than the
    same smart contract with the same token number. This means that a manufactured
    token is single and solitary and cannot be produced or copied any other way. This
    is similar to the fact that the Guernica painting, which Picasso drew with his
    own hands, is priceless, although there are thousands of copies. This is confirmed
    by blockchain and can be seen by everyone.

    and smart contracts, NFTs cannot be altered, duplicated, or destroyed. This means
    that whoever buys the NFT owns it and not the creator of the NFT. If the owner
    sells the NFT, they cannot falsify the ownership records since this is impossible
    with blockchain technology. This property of NFTs is what makes their potential
    in the music industry invaluable. We will discuss this in a later section.
  prefs: []

    during creation. The identity of the NFT owners are permanent records on the blockchain
    network. When NFT changes hands, the subsequent owners can be verified. This ensures
    that digital artwork such as video clips and music can be traced back to their
    original owners. It makes authentication much easier and efficient since third
    parties won't be needed for the process.

    copyright also means that the buyer has all commercial rights of the product,

    unique token and implement persistent features that cannot be changed after NFT's
    are released. Two ERC-721 tokens of the same type cannot be exchanged. This process
    is possible in theory, but when done in practice, they cannot completely replace
    each other. Because their metadata won't be the same. The difference between ERC-721
    tokens introduced in 2017 from ERC-20 tokens is that they cannot be used as cryptocurrencies
    and therefore cannot be exchanged for another cryptocurrency on an exchange. The
    ERC-721 is mostly used as a collection.

    supply of more common items endless while requiring the creation of only a certain
    number of specific rare items programmatically. The fact that developers over

    supplies thanks to the blockchain's "immutable" feature is especially suitable

    features of most cryptos. NFTs are rare in the sense that they are unique tokens
    tied to rare items such as music. More so, they are also scarce, which is where
    they derive their value from. Although NFT developers can create as many NFTs
    as they wish, they often limit the number of tokens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NFT's are rare because they are unique and non-copyable. In addition to the
    knowledge that rare things are generally valuable, a very limited number of artists
    and producers have NFT, especially at this time. This is a good opportunity, especially
    in a constantly evolving virtual world where we cannot easily predict what will
    happen. If we make a very simple assumption that the values of the products offered
    for sale in the first place will be lower than in the future, it may also mean
    that we may have products that will be sold much more expensively in the future.
