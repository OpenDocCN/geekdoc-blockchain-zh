- en: Even though cryptocurrency is digital in the format, it still needs to be stored
    in a safe place. When you have physical money, you usually can keep it in your
    wallet or open an account at the bank. For those with a lot of money on hand,
    a safe or another form of storage may be necessary.

- en: When it comes to cryptocurrency, storage decisions may not be so simple. Every
    transaction made with cryptocurrency is kept on a Blockchain, which holds a number
    of wallets that are provided for account holders. But it is best to avoid thinking
    of these wallets in the same way you might think of a safe deposit box or a safe
    in a bank.

    a public one. This address or key is needed so that others can send you money
    when you sell. The private address is password protected and will give you access
    to your funds when you want to make a withdrawal or a deposit. The private key
    is also used to transfer funds to other account holders.

    would view any other important documents (social security number, passport number,
    etc.) It should never be revealed to anyone unless you want to give them access
