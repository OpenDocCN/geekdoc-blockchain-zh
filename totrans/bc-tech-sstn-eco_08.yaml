- en: As a new economic paradigm, circular economy (CE) has recently gained attention.
    CE aims to detect, recover, sustain or increase value by transitioning from a
    ‘take, make and waste’ approach of production system to an ecosystem economy,
    thus restraining the environmental effect and waste of resources throughout the
    product economy, providing profitability and flexibility and creating value of
    what is considered a waste. Cities’ role in driving CE forward has been observed
    as being increasingly important to reach Sustainable Development. For this reason,
    there is an urgency to understand what a circular city is and how it might be
    composed. On the other side, blockchain is a method of recording information in
    a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack or cheat the system.
    This chapter initially explores the definition and characteristics of blockchain
    in detail. Then, several application scenarios of blockchain technology for a
    CE with focus on Singapore while transitioning to a CE are put forward. Finally,
    some of the challenges including energy consumption, lack of adequate skill set,
    the cost associated with the advanced technology and the need for raising awareness
    of circular business models, that still exist when applying the current blockchain
    technology to the CE, are discussed and analysed.

    of a new economic period [[9](#CR9)]. Technology supporters discuss that blockchain
    creates the base for trustworthy distributed record systems that could be essential
    to how personal and inter-organizational relationships are planned [[7](#CR7)].
    It is likely to have special effect on relationship, which is mainly caused by
    the ability of the technology to allow unaffectedly trust-free social and economic
    transactions that are imposed via a confirmed and transparent record and value
    exchange mechanisms without the support of a central authority [[8](#CR8)].

    technology [[53](#CR53)], where it assists as decentralized infrastructure, whether
    it is for implementation of a certain jobs (e.g. for financing, payments, investments,
    notary services) [[1](#CR1)] or as practical support, is capable of helping markets
    [[68](#CR68), [84](#CR84), [85](#CR85), [93](#CR93)]. The demand to set blockchain
    in such type of circumstances not only outlines the point that the technology
    reduces the use of intermediaries, in fact it is usually anticipated to develop
    the security of particular infrastructures and records, to expedite transparency
    and ability to track transactions, which altogether result in decreasing of the

    activated a range of design-oriented research in the information system (IS) field
    (e.g. [[52](#CR52), [84](#CR84)]). Simultaneously, IS researches condemn the results
    of these design studies. Actually, the outcomes of the IT articles are usually
    built upon a group of assumptions related to sociotechnical subjects, namely through
    disregarding the governance and coordination cost, neglecting the privacy issues
    along with the risk factors concerning the efficiency and efficacy of a clever
    agreement. Accordingly, the result of these articles continues to be subjected
    for speculation [[9](#CR9)]. Numerous researchers were approached lately for further
    acute viewpoints on blockchain in the IS researches (e.g. [[7](#CR7), [68](#CR68),
    [93](#CR93)]), causing a discussion related to how and where blockchain is successfully
    valid and where it could offer a special social effect [[93](#CR93)].

    to certainty through confessing that there is a shortage of systematic, technology-driven
    methods of understanding the possibility of technology [[39](#CR39)]. To overcome
    this shortage of the knowledge, it needs an inclusive indulgence and evaluation
    of the special effects of the particular parts of the blockchain and an analysis
    of common sides of the application [[93](#CR93)]. Yet, the empirical studies that
    are based on theory outside the blockchain’s primary use situation as the practical
    support of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is limited [[25](#CR25), [93](#CR93)]. This
    could be due to the scholars’ shortage of knowledge on how to group data for effective
    quantitative exploration or theoretical fuzz of the blockchain occurrence [[47](#CR47),
    [93](#CR93)].

    to conduct such type of researches taking to account that the practical application
    of blockchain is yet rare, and companies’ investments in the field of technology
    during the period of 2012–2017 were about $1.2 billion. This includes large organizations,

    specific to the extremely technical. For instance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency
    exchange, Coinbase, describes blockchain as follows: ‘a distributed, public ledger
    that contains the history of every bitcoin transaction’ [[20](#CR20)]. From an
    application-specific definition, this description does not reflect the point that
    blockchain could be reprocessed for other cryptocurrencies and industry applications
    autonomously. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the definition of the
    blockchain is slightly broader and described as follows: ‘a digital ledger in
    which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically
    and publicly’ (Oxford [[87](#CR87)]). According to Sulan [[108](#CR108)], this
    definition is also limited as blockchain technology could be used independently
    from cryptocurrencies and Bitcoins. The above-mentioned definitions focus on the
    role of a blockchain as a digital ledger, yet this field is still rising and growing
    fast. The usage of the ledger is one of the features of the blockchain but not
    its core. This feature mainly affects blockchain application that emphasizes on
    the interchange of value management in case of virtual assets.'

    for tracking the ownership and transfer of assets’ [[106](#CR106)].'

    (Wright 和 De Filippi 2015)。
- en: According to Sulan [[108](#CR108)], the main distinction here is that the distributed
    system divides the task among contributors in an ideal manner while a blockchain
    demands from every contributor to sustain a full bulge of the system and impose
    its regulations autonomously. In a system which bulges function on domestic information
    to achieve goals instead of the result of the central assembling impact, this
    decentralization guarantees that dragging the plug is almost not possible. In
    order for the network to operate, only one node is needed to continue functioning.
    Clearly, there is a demand for a strong and brief definition of blockchain. Taking
    into account previous definitions, blockchain can be defined as a ‘a decentralized
    database containing sequential, cryptographically linked blocks of digitally signed
    asset transactions, governed by a consensus model.’

  zh: 根据苏兰 [[108](#CR108)] 的观点，主要的区别在于，分布式系统理想地将在各个贡献者之间分配任务，而区块链则要求每个贡献者维持系统的完整膨胀并自主实施其规定。在一个通过国内信息实现目标而不是中央汇编影响的膨胀系统中，这种去中心化确保了几乎不可能拔掉插头。为了使网络运行，只需要一个节点继续工作。显然，需要一个强大而简洁的区块链定义。考虑到之前的定义，区块链可以被定义为“一个去中心化的数据库，包含一系列通过加密链接的、数字签名的资产交易块，由共识模型管理。”
- en: Sulan [[108](#CR108)] believes that this definition aims to focus on the core
    elements for blockchain technology where it is a peer-to-peer network database
    ruled by set of regulations. In addition, blockchains embody a moving away from
    a conventional trust agent and shift towards transparency. Blockchain allows applications
    from a wide range of industries to benefit from sharing, following and assessing
    digital assets.

    with Bitcoin, it can also be used autonomously in a diversity of markets and different
    use cases, namely health and insurance industry. In fact, blockchain can be implemented
    on any sector where assets are managed and transactions take place. It actually
    offers a safe chain of custody for the physical assets and so as the digital ones
    via its practical features that smooth the transactions through smart contracts,

- en: Transactions and Smart Contracts—Transaction occurs via exchange of assets which
    are managed through the company services’ guidelines. These guidelines are reflected
    via scripting languages (e.g. Bitcoin’s forth) and are operated for progressive
    transactions that need to be implemented, where they also build the foundation
    for smart contract. In order to manage a transaction, a smart contract, which
    is a group of logic guidelines in the form of a coded script, needs to be inserted.
    The contract is implemented independently and is used to manage the transaction
    [[15](#CR15)]. In this method, contract performs like smart software agents [[104](#CR104)].
    After a smart contract is implemented in the blockchain, it turns into an independent
    agent that is unable to be tampered. Following this stage, an application then
    recites the codes when executing a transaction, perform and process the outcomes.
    The nature of the smart contract is not limited to an application-specific code.
    It is also used to classify the condition and terms of a contract into the workflow
    of the transaction. Ethereum (the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin)
    is an alt-coin technology that has been developed to support smart contracts.

- en: Consensus and Trust—Blockchain is trusted by agreement as all related parties
    should have the same copies of the blockchain, yet each member still have to validate
    it. The core strength of the blockchain is in its decentralization aspect taking
    into account its database is owned by all members. To make sure that each copy
    is reliable, an agreed algorithm is needed. The agreed algorithm permits the public
    to confirm that every single added block is authentic. It also stops the attackers
    from bargaining and splitting the chain [[21](#CR21)]. Another approach recommended
    was to use proof-of-work method where a hard cryptographic puzzle needs to be
    resolved by miners [[79](#CR79)]. Miners consume resources and are acknowledged
    for their work through several motivations. There are also other models, namely
    proof-of-burn, proof-of-elapsed-time, proof-of-stake and proof-of-capacity which
    have been recommended in the literature to handle the flaws of the initial proof-of-work
    model by trying to equalize objectivity and source spending [[57](#CR57)]. According
    to Sulan [[108](#CR108)], blockchain by nature is suspicious. It has been created
    to reduce the necessity for any object to enter transactions. It builds a reliable
    model according to a group agreement, as the network confirms the transactions
    and approved their adding to the chain. There is no intermediary, hence the idea
    of trust continues to be inherent as every record in the blockchain is confirmed
    by the public that carries serval copies of the blockchain. When trust mediators
    are eliminated from transactions, blockchain is capable of interrupting several
    main businesses. The customary transaction models count on dominant expert to
    perform in the clearinghouse character. Trust is given to the dominant expert
    with a probability that it will continue to be truthful during clearing transactions
    and validation. The occurrences of records are included with the dominant expert.
    In case the dominant expert is cooperated deliberately, such as hacking, then
    the interlocutor has the ability to inflict a widespread chaos into the system.
    The blockchain model reduces the dominant expert through distributing copies of
    the records to all related parties (Fig. [1](#Fig1)). Every single contributor
    keeps their own case of the blockchain. They transmit the variations through creating
    fresh blocks and ask for confirmation as per the agreed model rules. As soon as
    it is confirmed, the block would be added to everyone’s chain. The method is likely
    more secure than the customary model, and the intermediary agent is not needed
    anymore, which raises an interruption to the current situation.![../images/520662_1_En_8_Chapter/520662_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_8_Chapter/520662_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png)

    for every single transaction and on computationally exclusive agreed model to
    substitute dominant experts. Many of the latest transactions are well ordered
    into the block. Afterwards, the block is cryptographically connected to group
    of blocks, called blockchain, and is confirmed via an agreed model that includes
    major computing assets. Since the blockchain is a file with open-access feature
    and simulated on several full nodes of the system, there is no object that can
    control the list of transaction. As each block is shredded and implanted into
    the chain, it is undeniable and acts as the last record of the previous transactions.
    An object is not able to modify the chain unless it changes all the other blocks
    that are after it, and this is a hard and costly computational effort. Hence,
    this safeguards the blockchain and builds a truthful autonomous of a dominant
    expert (Sulan [[108](#CR108)].

    considering methods like reuse, recycling of both energy and materials at every
    single level of the product life cycle to guarantee the environmental product
    design from the beginning with a recycling goal at the end [[118](#CR118)]. The

    raw material, the circular economy can eliminate the industry’s request for key
    raw materials. The lesser the request for key raw materials will aid in decreasing

    industry to be less impactful by the changes in price in the global commodity
    markets and so as to the uncertainty of the source produced by the shortage or

    six pillars that businesses should apply for a shift towards circular economy.
    Such method was not initially planned for CE application in cities yet some of
    its principles add towards a circular city as long as they are implemented thoroughly.
    One of the pillars ‘Regenerate’ aims to reinstate the natural capital and escalate
    the ecosystems’ flexibility through recurring the precious biological nutrients
    carefully to the environment either through anaerobic absorption or composting.
    This is facilitated through the support to support viewpoint which indicates that
    technical and biological beneficial need to be dispersed during the product’s
    lifespan from the early design stage onwards. In the constructed environment,
    this pillar indorses the use of renewable energy to influence construction. On
    the other side, the ‘Share’ pillar follows the extreme use of modules, products
    or resources during sharing systems or give and take platforms. As for the ‘Optimize’
    pillar, it is more related to improving the efficiency and the functioning of
    the product, automation and distance sensing and so as eliminating the excesses
    in the production. Regarding the ‘Loop’ pillar, it has four core goals, which
    are as follows: to reuse material, to remove biochemical from biological excesses,
    to abstract excesses anaerobically and to obtain the production of modules and
    products. One of the other pillars ‘Virtualise’ concentrates on two kinds of dematerialization,
    which are direct and indirect dematerialization. The preceding pillar is ‘Exchange’
    pillar which has three main categories including new technologies; innovation
