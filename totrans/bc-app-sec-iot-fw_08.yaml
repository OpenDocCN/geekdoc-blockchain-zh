- en: A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked together
    using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,
    a timestamp, and transaction data. It is a decentralized, distributed and public
    digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers called
    nodes. Blockchain, in collaboration with the technologies like Artificial Intelligence,
    the Internet of Things, Big data, *etc.*, provides more effective outcomes by
    minimizing manpower with an increase in its feasibility. IoT is all about expanding
    the power of the internet beyond computers and smartphones to a whole range of
    other things, processes, and environments. Our day-to-day life can be made interesting
    with the applications of IoT-enabled devices in the home, agriculture, logistics,
    industries, healthcare sectors, and so on. They can be combined with the disciplines
    like data collection, management of huge data, storage of data, data analytics,
    *etc.* These IoT devices are embedded with sensors that are vulnerable to hackers
    and malware. At present, we cannot give complete assurance of the security of
    the access and data associated with the devices as it is possible for an intruder
    to misuse or mishandle the scheduled process. But, in association with blockchain
    technology, we can acquire solutions for problems related to security.

    a centralized architecture, whereas blockchain provides a distributed peer-to-peer

    that maintains the continuously growing records in a distributed, peer-to-peer
    network node [[1](#c7r1)]. This makes the Blockchain and IoT to get integrated
    to provide even better services. Generally, IoT devices are liable to many kinds
    of security attacks [[2](#c7r2)]. The following are some of the attacks which

    types, namely private, public, and consortium. A private blockchain is a restricted

    and others will be restricted from accessing it. There is no restriction of access
    in the public blockchain. The consortium is a semi-restricted blockchain where
    access permission will be given with certain restrictions to work with the blockchain
    platform [[6](#c7r6)]. A platform is an environment in which a piece of software
    can be executed. Many platforms have been designed to support and develop blockchain

    sharing. If data gets shared from country to country, then it is known as global
    sharing. With this platform, there is no need for a patient to carry his/her entire

    has started penetrating almost all the fields in our day-to- day life. Many security
    measures are still considered to enrich the security of these blockchain-enabled
    IoT systems. As further work, blockchain with IoT can be implemented in all the
    fields without any interruption, as it is under progress in our country. Therefore,
    it must be included in all the sectors of our environment. Researchers can make
    it possible by implementing this technology in a user-friendly manner in daily
    life in order to preserve the record in a secure way. We can conclude that the
    development and deployment of blockchain technology with other technologies like
    Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, and Image processing
    are essential to address the specific demands of our future.
