    impact on performance. In Chap. [1](480347_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml), I laid the foundation
    of how the market will likely react to increased wireless performance. In this

    the major path to figuring out how to establish a distributed network that can
    be monitored to improve network performance more dynamically. This is accomplished
    using the Edge by placing the data and program on intermediate local servers.
    Indeed, according to Gartner ([2019](#CR2)), an estimated 10% of enterprise data
    is processed outside the central server or cloud. By 2020, they expect this to
    dramatically increase to 75%!

    and existing third parties competing to provide the alternative network services
    to their customers. Ultimately, it’s about developing a strategy that allows companies
    to have a roadmap of alternative distributed networks where alternative paths
    are available depending on traffic demands. It’s like running a complex railroad
    system where one can switch tracks depending on part failures, weather issues,
    and congestion. The important issue is to have as many options available for network

    technical terms and their meanings are important to effectively engage in the

    that will be defined for computers, that is, machine-to-machine, rather than for

    Six Degrees of Freedom (6DoF). 6DoF refers to, “the freedom of movement of a rigid
    body in three-dimensional space.” This essentially means that the body can move
    forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and combined with rotation about three
    perpendicular axes (termed pitch, yaw, and roll). Figure [5.2](#Fig2) shows a
    6DoF diagram.![../images/480347_1_En_5_Chapter/480347_1_En_5_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/480347_1_En_5_Chapter/480347_1_En_5_Fig2_HTML.png)

    from a myriad of dimensions and for multiple reasons. Thus, the analyst must shift
    from a process design approach to one that centralizes design based on repositories
    of data. Processes will evolve from different user views of the same data, but
    used for different reasons mandated by the type of outcomes desired. What is even
    more significant, is that the requestor may be the same physical user, but not
    the same logical person. This concept can be related to polymorphism in object
    design, where objects take on different functionality depending on its data type
    and class. This design challenge can be related to Fig. [1.​2](480347_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml)
    which defines the different types of user identities. This means that a user of
    the system may be polymorphic if that person uses data as an individual and a
    business user, or a consumer at different sessions. Figure [5.3](#Fig3) shows
    a 5G version of 6DoF. Note that the dimensions represent the different types of
    behavioral views and needs of the same user but in different contexts.![../images/480347_1_En_5_Chapter/480347_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/480347_1_En_5_Chapter/480347_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png)

    massive collections of data. Multiple functional primitive applications will dynamically
    be compiled to form specific applications needed by a particular user view. Many
    functional primitives will also be available from third party libraries. These
    applications are typically called functions; common routines that can be dynamically
    linked into more complex applications. One of the analyst’s challenges is to ensure
    that data element attributes such as field length and data characteristics like
    alphanumeric, numeric, remain consistent. Depending on the user view, data elements
    can take on different characteristics, so there needs to be a consensus in design
    to achieve unified data definitions. However, this can be problematic. In Chap. [4](480347_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml),
    I covered how data element definitions can have what is called “alias” definitions.
    Alias definitions allow multiple definitions of the same element, often under
    a different identifier. This is similar to having multiple different email addresses
    that are really the same personal ID.

    throughout a network. It is likely that many integrated networks will have 4G
    subsystems because the full migration to 5G may take years to achieve. Third party
    vendors have developed intelligent applications that can dynamically ascertain
    changes in G level at the domain level. It’s like software that examines your
    computer and determines its operating system and component features. These “connectivity
    management” products will assess the G network and provide an ability to execute
    the compatible version of an application that will work. Therefore, it will be
    necessary to have multiple versions of the same functional primitives! This design
    philosophy is certainly not unique. For example, even today many websites have
    alternative versions depending on weather a user is accessing the site from a
    computer or a smart phone.

    capacities including more: data storage, executable applications, and interfaces
    with third party cloud storage. I expect that smartphones will achieve similar
    processing power as today’s desktop and laptop computers. As one can see, the
    cloud interface is an important piece of 5G success. Hard disks, per se will become
    obsolete because the volume of data needed will make them impractical to maintain
    on local hard drives. Because the consumer market will drive the demand for more
    powerful smartphones, there will be growing pressure to make applications 5G ready.
    Many experts predict that 5G application development will greatly exceed the 4G
    evolution and occur twice as fast as 4G LTE! The transformation to 5G will, without
    doubt, place stress on companies to replace their slower and restricted legacy
    systems. Replacement of legacies then should be a high priority for any organization
    and could be a key for business success or failure. The paths from legacy will
    be discussed further in Chap. [11](480347_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml).'

    emanated from the proliferation of social media over the internet and intertwined
    with the increased capabilities of AI and ML. Facebook, Uber, and Amazon have
    all used AI and ML to track consumer behaviors and develop statistical data elements
    that keep constant analysis on their behaviors. Obviously, the proliferation of
    sensors and other intelligent IoT devices will accelerate the collection and analysis
    of historical data. There are two new effects of this on data: (1) AI and ML software
    will be needed to do the analysis; and (2) new data elements will be created and
    stored in various databases across the cloud and on the Edge. These new data elements
    fall into the category of “derived” since they are formed as a result of a computation.
    A simple example is A + B = C. C is a derived data element (as discussed in Chap. [4](480347_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml))
    and considered redundant because if you store A and B as elements, you can always
    just calculate C. As explained in Chap. [4](480347_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml), if you
    store C, and A or B changes, then C is now incorrect and the database loses its
    integrity. However, with big data and 5G improvements, recalculations can be done
    much quicker. Furthermore, because these new types of derived elements are tracking
    changes in real time, it is necessary to add the redundancies for sake of accuracy

    in your region. The first phase of 5G will address broadband data needs as consumers
    race to buy 5G ready smartphones. Smartphones should be capable of downloading
    gigabytes of data within seconds and this is expected to be ready within 1–2 years.
    By the end of two years we expect earphones to provide real-time language translations,
    ability to watch events from multiple points using live camera streams, and aspects

    of thinking about how such new capabilities can be implemented in their businesses,
    and the opportunities for new types of products and service offerings. The abundance
    of different versions of the same application will be stored in multiple tiers
    of the 5G agile application architecture that I presented in Chap. [1](480347_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml).
    The reality is how the analyst will provide the necessary requirements documentation
    that can define these versions and fulfill an ever changing and evolving user
    base.

    the 5G era is complicated. Analysts will need to be understand a lot more of the
    hardware and network implications. The user community is also far more challenging
    as the smartphone has emerged as the gateway of interaction among a broad range
    of individual relationships. Performance continues to be central. With AI and
    ML central for competitive advantage, analyst will need to be better versed on
    how the placement of hardware, software and infrastructure affect the decisions
    on how much data to place on a device along with distributed processing in a mobile
    environment. I predict that we will see an emergence of Edge computing along with
    IoT to deliver these capabilities. Edge will also include cloud technology that
    will be central to the transformation of the new network era.
