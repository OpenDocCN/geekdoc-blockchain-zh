- en: When an investor seeks to make an allocation to the cryptocurrency and digital
    asset space, they effectively have two mechanisms by which to do so. The first
    would be by going to the market and directly making a purchase of a virtual currency
    or other digital assets such as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). This can be referred
    to as a ***direct investment.*** The second option is for an investor to give
    money to a third party to invest in the crypto space on their behalf. In practice
    these third parties can be referred to by a number of different names including
    ***crypto-asset managers***, ***crypto fund manager***, ***crypto manager***,
    ***crypto hedge fund***, ***external crypto money managers*** and ***unaffiliated

    called a ***crypto hedge fund*** as noted above, as opposed to investing directly
    into cryptocurrencies themselves. Firstly, even though an investor has decided
    that they want to allocate capital to the broader crypto space, they may not have
    the requisite expertise to select which sectors in the crypto space would be profitable.
    Hiring a third-party crypto-asset manager can solve this problem by leveraging

    feel would be the most profitable on the investor's behalf.

  zh: 投资者会投资于加密货币基金（如上所述，也称为加密货币对冲基金）而不是直接投资于加密货币本身的原因有很多。首先，即使投资者决定将资本分配给更广泛的加密货币领域，他们可能没有必要的专业知识来选择加密货币领域中哪些部门会盈利。雇佣第三方加密货币资产管理公司可以解决这个问题，通过利用资产管理公司的专业知识代表投资者投资于他们认为最盈利的加密货币领域。
- en: A second reason an investor may utilize a crypto-asset manager, sometimes referred
    to as an external fund manager, is to more actively manager their crypto investments.
    For a number of reasons, investors may simply not have the time, or skill, to
    adequately monitor and trade their crypto investments with the frequency required. Due in
    large part to the high volatility that is frequent at times in the crypto space,
    thus active management and oversight of crypto investments can often help better
    capitalize on profits that otherwise may have been lost if positions had not been
    traded on. Additionally, more active oversight of positions facilitates enhanced
    risk management. Now that we have established the reasons that an investor might
    want to allocate capital to a crypto fund manager, we can next discuss the process

    ***investment strategy***. The purpose of the investment strategy is twofold.
    Firstly, it provides an anchor by which you as the investment manager of the fund
    will guide your investment philosophy around. Secondly, the investment strategy
    will provide investors in your fund with a basic idea as to what types of investments
    your fund will be making. As part of the investment strategy, you will also typically

- en: For a crypto fund for example the broadest definition of the investment universe
    would be all cryptocurrencies. If you plan on investing in all cryptocurrencies
    as an asset manager then this definition would be applicable however, in practice
    the crypto universe is large and growing larger by the day with the rapid growth
    of altcoins. Data suggests there are over 7,800 different cryptocurrencies as
    of December 2020.[¹](#FPar1) It is unlikely therefore that a particular fund would
    set out with the goal of investing across the entire crypto investment universe.
    To help better define the investment universe, a crypto fund manager may define
    the investment universe more specifically to include for example, coins in the
    top 20% of overall crypto market cap.

    因此，一个特定的基金不太可能设定目标，投资整个加密货币投资宇宙。为了更好地定义投资宇宙，加密货币基金经理可能会更具体地定义投资宇宙，例如，包括市值前20%的加密货币。
- en: This type of more specific definition provides better clarity to not only the
    fund manager but also investors as to where the focus of the fund’s investments
    will be. It is important to note that while specificity is important, when starting
    a crypto fund, you should be careful not to define the investment universe too
    narrowly as this will likely preclude too many new investment opportunities that
    may arise in other parts of the market over time. It should also be noted that
    as a crypto manager you have the ability to redefine the investment universe throughout
    the life of the fund as longer term macroeconomic changes might make investments
    in previously uncontemplated areas of the crypto market attractive. Any major
    investment strategy or universe changes should be done either in conjunction with
    investors or at a minimum with their consent.

    overall higher net worth than others. With this higher net worth comes the ability
    to make larger investments in asset classes such as crypto. This class of retail
    investors can be referred to as ***high-net worth***, and then for those with
    even more net worth, we move to the ***ultra-high net worth*** category. There
    are a variety of different approaches people take to delineating between regular
    retail investors, high-net worth and ultra-high net worth investors. Certain high-net
    worth and ultra-high net worth families opt to create a stand-alone company to
    manage their assets. These are known as family offices or single-family offices.

    net worth and ultra-high net worth groups differently. For example, in the US
    the term, “accredited investor” is defined in the Securities Act of 1933 Rules
    215 and 501(a).[²](#FPar1) Specifically, the term accredited investor was expanded
    in 2020 in Rule 501(a) to include an entity that owns investments of $5 million
    not formed for the specific purposes of investing in the securities as well as
    a so-called, “knowledgeable employee” of a private fund.[³](#FPar1)

    特别是，2020年Rule 501(a)中对合格投资者的定义扩大到了包括一个拥有500万美元投资的非专门投资于证券的实体以及所谓的“知识型员工”私人基金。[³](#FPar1)

    Singapore where under Section 4A(1)(a) of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA),
    Chapter 289 an accredited investor can include an individual whose net personal
    assets exceed in value $2 million (or its equivalent in a foreign currency).[⁴](#FPar1)
    The European Union (EU) under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)
    utilizes the term, “professional clients” for investors that among other criteria
    have a financial instrument portfolio, defined as including cash deposits and
    financial instruments, exceeding €500,000.[⁵](#FPar1) Besides the retail category,
    the other major group of investors are institutional investors. A key difference
    between retail and institutional investors is that institutional investors manage
    capital on behalf of others.

    欧盟根据金融工具指令（MiFID）使用“专业客户”这个术语来指代投资者，这些投资者满足其他标准，其中包括金融工具组合，定义为包括现金存款和金融工具，超过50万欧元。[⁵](#FPar1)
    除了零售类别外，投资者的大组别还有机构投资者。零售投资者与机构投资者之间的关键区别是，机构投资者代表他人管理资本。

    investors typically invest even more larger amounts of capital. Common kinds of
    institutional investors include corporate pension funds, public pensions, insurance
    companies, banking platforms, investment consultants, fund of funds, sovereign
    clients, endowments and foundations. Additionally, there are certain family offices,

    the management company also typically maintains or contracts with vendors for
    employment-related services such as Human Resources, benefits administration,
    certain types of insurance coverage and payroll management. The management company
    will typically serve as an entity known as the ***General Partner*** (GP) of the

    information technology hardware. It should be noted that a portion of these expenses

- en: This raises an additional point worth clarifying. Certain classes of services
    are maintained by both the management company and the crypto fund. For example,
    both entities would typically engage some type of legal counsel. These could be
    the same law firm for both the management company and the fund or different law
    firms. The fund counsel would provide services related to the management of the
    crypto fund itself whereas the management company counsel would provide more traditional
    corporate legal services directly to the management company. The expenses of the
    fund counsel would be billed directly to the fund as an expense. Similarly, the
    management company counsel would bill their expenses to the management company
    and not the fund. This segregation of expenses is an important concept that is
    reiterated throughout the different service providers engaged by the fund and
    management company.

  zh: 这引发了一个值得澄清的额外问题。某些服务类别由管理公司和加密基金共同维护。例如，两个实体通常都会聘请某种类型的法律顾问。这可能是管理公司和基金共同使用的同一律师事务所，也可能是不同的律师事务所。基金法律顾问会提供与加密基金本身管理相关的服务，而管理公司法律顾问则会直接向管理公司提供更传统的公司法律服务。基金法律顾问的费用会直接作为费用计入基金。类似地，管理公司法律顾问会将他们的费用计入管理公司，而不是基金。这种费用隔离是一个重要的概念，这个概念在基金和管理公司聘请的不同服务提供商中反复提到。
- en: The reason for this is the investors in a fund ultimately end up paying for
    the expenses of the fund. There are two broad categories of fund expenses. The
    first are startup costs. These are also sometimes called organizational costs.
    These costs are the initial expenses required to initially start the fund. Examples
    of organizational expenses include hiring a law firm to draft the fund offering
    documents, fund raising costs, expenses for advice from accountants and lawyers
    with regard to fund structuring and tax considerations, and related office and
    technology expenses. The second category of expenses are ongoing expenses. Examples
    of these would be a monthly fund administration fee, audit fees, fees for ongoing
    legal advice, regulatory filing expenses, investment research costs, trading expenses,
    and ongoing office and technology costs for those services utilized by the fund.

    in order to learn the specifics your proposed fund and determine what scope of
    services in their respective functions are most appropriate. It is therefore advisable
    that you select a law firm in advance of the other service providers so that these
    documents can be created and utilized by them. Furthermore, the other service
    providers may also have certain specific questions that your legal counsel may

- en: Audits are typically performed for each fiscal year that the fund is in operation.
    In some cases, audits can cover a period of less than a year. This is referred
    to as a ***stub audit***. One common reason for a stub audit would be if you launched
    your crypto fund mid-year (i.e., in June) as opposed to on January 1st and therefore,
    the audit for the first year would be shorter than one year (i.e., the stub).
    It should also be noted that some audits cover a period of greater than a year.
  id: totrans-117
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 审计通常针对基金运营的每个财政年度进行。在某些情况下，审计可以涵盖不到一年的时间段。这被称为***闰年审计***。闰年审计的一个常见原因可能是您在年中启动您的加密货币基金（即6月），而不是1月1日，因此，第一年的审计会比一年短（即闰年）。还应注意的是，有些审计涵盖的时间超过一年。
- en: A common scenario where this occurs is when the stub year is added onto the
    first full year. An example of this would be a fund launched on May 1st, 2020,
    whose audit was not prepared on December 31st, 2020, but instead December 31st,
    2021\. This would be an audit covering a 19 month period as opposed to the standard
    12 month period. The next audit would typically then pickup for a 12 month period
    covering a full year. Different jurisdictions have different regulations regarding
    the permissibility of stub audits. Additionally, certain investors may not want
    stub audits due to the longer time period they cover. Other investors may prefer
    the cost savings associated with spreading out the audit timeline.
  id: totrans-118

  zh: 一种常见的情况是，当在第一个完整年度的基础上加上闰年时会发生这种情况。一个例子是一只基金于2020年5月1日启动，其审计并非在2020年12月31日准备，而是在2021年12月31日进行。这将是覆盖19个月期间的审计，而不是标准的12个月期间。下一个审计通常会涵盖一个12个月的期间，覆盖一整年。不同司法管辖区关于允许闰年审计有不同的规定。此外，某些投资者可能因为闰年审计覆盖的时间更长而不希望进行闰年审计。其他投资者可能更倾向于由于延长审计时间表而带来的成本节省。
- en: The result of an audit are financial statements for the funds. These financial
    statements include an audit opinion by the auditor as well as a wealth of financial
    information about your funds including details of investments throughout the year,
    profits earned, valuation of positions and cash balances. The financial statements
    are typically distributed to a crypto fund’s investor approximately two to three
    months after the end of the audit year. For example, if audited financial statement
    were prepared for a fund ranging during a full calendar year (i.e., January 1st
    through December 31st) then the audited financial statements would likely be finished
    and ready to be distributed to investors in March or April of the following year.
    The reason for this delay is because it can often take the auditor several months
    to collect and review all of the appropriate information. The cost associated
    with audits does not typically begin to accrue until the auditor actually starts
    their work.

  zh: 审计的结果是基金的财务报表。这些财务报表包括审计师的审计意见以及关于您基金的大量财务信息，包括全年投资详情、赚取的利润、持仓估值和现金余额。财务报表通常在审计年度结束后的两到三个月分发给加密货币基金的投资者。例如，如果为跨越一整年（即从1月1日至12月31日）的基金准备了审计财务报表，那么经过审计的财务报表可能会在次年的3月或4月准备好并分发给投资者。之所以会有这个延迟，是因为审计师通常需要几个月的时间来收集和审查所有适当的信息。审计相关的成本通常在审计师实际开始工作后才开始累积。

    company and associated fund vehicles with the financial regulators. The first
    question to consider is whether you can legally open a crypto fund to receive
    investment from third parties. It is likely that you would have already researched
    this issue either by yourself or with your attorney when drafting your fund’s
    legal documentation; however, there may be certain specific requirements in different
    jurisdictions that you should be sure that you are adhering to, as well as can
    provide documentation to support how you meet the requirements. These requirements
    could relate to corporate structure items such as the allowable structures for
    the legal vehicles that you may be allowed to utilize in different jurisdictions.

  zh: 在启动加密基金之前，你可能需要将基金管理公司和相关的基金实体注册到金融监管机构。首先要考虑的问题是，你是否可以合法地开设一个加密基金以接收第三方的投资。你可能已经在制定基金法律文件时，自己或与你的律师一起研究过这个问题；然而，不同司法管辖区可能有一些特定的要求，你需要确保遵守，并且能够提供文件支持你是如何满足这些要求的。这些要求可能与公司结构事项有关，例如，在不同司法管辖区允许使用的法律实体的允许结构。
- en: Additionally, particular jurisdiction's eligibility requirements could be related
    to the individuals associated with the fund at launch. For example, certain key
    individuals who will be involved in the management and operations of the crypto
    fund may need to obtain individual licenses and registrations from regulators
    in addition to registering the management company and funds themselves. An example
    of this in the US would be if an individual who works in a business development
    role and raises assets for the crypto fund may need to pass the Series 7 General
    Securities Representative Exam given by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    (FINRA) prior to working to offer securities for sale.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 此外，特定司法管辖区的资格要求可能与基金启动时关联的个人有关。例如，某些关键个人，如将参与加密基金的管理和运营，可能除了需要注册管理公司和基金本身外，还需要从监管机构获得个人许可和注册。在美国，一个例子是，如果一个在企业发展角色中并为加密基金筹集资产的个人可能需要通过金融行业监管机构（FINRA）提供的系列7通用证券代表考试，才能开始销售证券的工作。
- en: In addition to specific licensing requirements, there may be certain historical
    items that could impact the ability of individuals to be able to launch a fund.
    For example, if the individual who will be the founder of the fund or Chief Investment
    Officer (CIO) is a convicted felon they may be ineligible to start certain types
    of funds. In the US, this restriction is in place Section 9 of the Investment
    Company Act of 1940, which automatically disqualifies any person that has been
    convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanors relating to the purchase or sale
    of securities to, “*serve or act in the capacity of employee, officer, director,
    member of an* *advisory board, investment adviser**, or depositor of any registered
    investment company, or principal underwriter for any registered open-end company,
    registered unit investment trust, or registered face-amount certificate company*.”[⁶](#FPar1)

  zh: 除了特定的许可要求外，某些历史事项可能会影响个人启动基金的能力。例如，如果基金创始人或首席投资官（CIO）是有期徒刑的罪犯，他们可能无权启动某些类型的基金。在美国，这项限制规定于1940年投资公司法案第9节，自动取消任何因购买或销售证券而被定罪的重罪或某些轻罪的人的资格，这些人“*不得担任或充任雇员、官员、董事、咨询委员会成员、投资顾问*”或任何注册投资公司的受托人、注册开放式公司的主要承销商、注册单位投资信托或注册面额证书公司的负责人。”[⑥](#FPar1)
- en: Assuming that you are eligible to launch a crypto fund, the next question to
    consider, whether or not you need to register your fund with financial regulators
    at launch. The answer to this question can depend on different registration requirements
    in the jurisdiction where you plan to launch your fund. For example, in the US
    a fund does not generally need to register as an ***Investment Adviser (IA)***
    with the ***US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)*** if they managed under
    $150 million in ***Regulatory Asset Under Management (RAUM)******.*** For reference,
    these registration requirement thresholds and associated compliance obligations
    are discussed in more detail in Chapter [4](513667_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml). In addition
    to jurisdictional requirements that would generally apply broadly to all proposed
    crypto funds in any jurisdiction, there may also be fund-specific considerations
    that vary based on the unique aspects of you’re the crypto fund you are launching.
    For example, in the Cayman Islands, a popular offshore destination for many fund
    managers, if your fund would only have a single investor, and never intends to
    have more than this, then it may be exempted from registering the fund with the
    Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) as outlined in the Cayman Private Funds
    Law 2020.[⁷](#FPar1)

  zh: 假设你有资格启动一个加密基金，那么接下来需要考虑的问题是，在启动时是否需要向金融监管机构注册你的基金。这个问题取决于你计划启动基金的司法管辖区内的不同注册要求。例如，在美国，如果一个基金管理的***监管资产净额（RAUM）***不超过1.5亿美元，那么他们通常不需要向美国证券交易委员会（SEC）注册为投资顾问（IA）。**参考**，这些注册要求和相关的合规义务在第四章中有更详细的讨论。除了适用于所有拟议的加密基金的司法管辖区要求外，还可能存在基于您即将启动的加密基金独特特征的基金特定考虑因素。例如，在开曼群岛，许多基金经理的热门离岸目的地，如果您的基金只有一个投资者，并且从未打算超过这个数量，那么它可能免于向开曼群岛金融管理局（CIMA）注册，如开曼群岛2020年私人基金法所概述。[⁷](#FPar1)

    you will need to register under. Due to a digital asset-friendly regulatory environment,
    the country of Malta has become a popular destination for the opening of blockchain-related
    companies and crypto funds. In Malta, there are a number of different types of
    structures that may be utilized for private funds. These include Alternative Investment
    Funds (AIFs), Professional Investor Funds (PIFs) and Undertakings for Collective
    Investment Schemes (UCITS). Each of these fund classifications has different requirements
    and advantages. Depending on a number of factors including the type and number
    of investors that you are targeting for your crypto fund as well as other items
    such as the tax implications of different fund structures your attorney can likely
    provide guidance as to which fund classification would be most appropriate in
    different jurisdictions.

- en: It is also important to note that in addition to broader country-wide regulations,
    such as the federal ones in a US context referenced above, your fund may also
    be subjected to different state or regional registration requirements as well.
    For example, certain crypto-related businesses may need to be registered on a
    state level with state regulators that are distinct from the federal regulators.

- en: The last step in the process is to actually launch the crypto fund. There is
    no formal definition of when a launch technically occurs. Some people may refer
    to the fund as being launched as early as when the initial corporation paperwork
    is filed forming the management company and relevant fund entities. Others may
    refer to the fund as being launched when it actually starts the process of approaching
    investors to gauge their interest in investing in your crypto fund. More commonly,
    however, others will consider a fund to be launched only once it has begun to
    manage capital and actively trade. Regardless of the semantics involved when it
    is appropriate to actually utilize the terms launch, once the fund is launched
    it does not simply run on autopilot in perpetuity but rather it enters what is
    known as the ***post-launch phase***.
  id: totrans-128

  zh: 过程中的最后一步实际上是启动加密货币基金。技术上何时算是一次启动没有正式定义。有些人可能认为基金在最初的公司文件提交 forming the management
    company and relevant fund entities 时就意味着已经启动。其他人可能认为基金在实际开始接近投资者以衡量他们对投资您的加密货币基金的意愿时才算是启动。然而，更常见的是，其他人认为只有当基金开始管理资本并积极交易时，才算是启动了基金。无论涉及何种词义学问题，何时适宜实际使用“启动”这个术语，一旦基金启动，它并不会简单地在永恒的自动驾驶状态下运行，而是进入所谓的**启动后阶段**。
- en: In this phase, many of the considerations involved in the pre-launch plan still
    come into effect. For example, after the initial base of capital raised from investors
    to fund the launch additional capital usually needs to continue to be raised from
    investors. This fund raising process often involves producing a variety of fund
    reporting including market commentary, portfolio and risk analyses, responding
    to new investor inquiries, ***requests for proposal (RFIs)*** and ***due diligence
    questionnaires (DDQs)***. Additionally, there is reporting that must take place
    to existing investors to ensure that they want to both keep their existing capital
    with your crypto fund as well as potentially add new capital on top of their already
    existing investments. This capital from both new and existing investors would
    continue to be raised until the fund reaches what it feels is the maximum level
    of capital that it can appropriately deploy based on the market conditions and
    the crypto fund’s investment strategy. This figure is known as a crypto fund’s
    ***capacity***.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在这个阶段，许多预发计划中的考虑因素仍然生效。例如，在从投资者那里筹集资金以支持启动之后，通常需要继续从投资者那里筹集更多资金。这个筹资过程通常涉及制作各种筹资报告，包括市场评论、投资组合和风险分析，回应新的投资者询问，**提案请求（RFIs）**和**尽职调查问卷（DDQs）**。此外，还需要向现有投资者报告，以确保他们希望将现有资本保留在您的加密货币基金中，以及可能在他们已经存在的投资基础上增加新的资本。来自新旧投资者的这部分资本将继续筹集，直到基金达到它认为在市场情况和加密货币基金投资策略下可以适当部署的最大资本水平。这个数字被称为加密货币基金的**容量**。
- en: Additionally, as your crypto fund continues to raise capital it may approach
    certain regulatory assets under management (RAUM), as we noted above, your fund
    may be subjected to additional regulatory registration requirements which also
