- en: When an investor seeks to make an allocation to the cryptocurrency and digital
    asset space, they effectively have two mechanisms by which to do so. The first
    would be by going to the market and directly making a purchase of a virtual currency
    or other digital assets such as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). This can be referred
    to as a ***direct investment.*** The second option is for an investor to give
    money to a third party to invest in the crypto space on their behalf. In practice
    these third parties can be referred to by a number of different names including
    ***crypto-asset managers***, ***crypto fund manager***, ***crypto manager***,
    ***crypto hedge fund***, ***external crypto money managers*** and ***unaffiliated
    crypto investment managers***.

    or allocate to the crypto space via a third-party manager are not mutually exclusive,
    and an investor may do both at the same time. This may occur for a variety of
    reasons including the individual investor’s expertise, their desire to maintain
    more control over certain parts of their overall crypto allocation and the time
    the investor wishes to devote to overseeing their investments.

    of Delaware. From the perspective of a US-based investor, this would be referred
    to as a domestic fund. Another common fund structure for non-US-based funds would
    be the limited liability company (Ltd.) structure. These funds are commonly domiciled
    outside of the US in jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands and would be referred
    to as an offshore fund from the perspective of a US investor. Under both the LP

    called a ***crypto hedge fund*** as noted above, as opposed to investing directly
    into cryptocurrencies themselves. Firstly, even though an investor has decided
    that they want to allocate capital to the broader crypto space, they may not have
    the requisite expertise to select which sectors in the crypto space would be profitable.
    Hiring a third-party crypto-asset manager can solve this problem by leveraging
    on the asset manager's expertise to invest capital into the crypto sectors they
    feel would be the most profitable on the investor's behalf.
  prefs: []

- en: A second reason an investor may utilize a crypto-asset manager, sometimes referred
    to as an external fund manager, is to more actively manager their crypto investments.
    For a number of reasons, investors may simply not have the time, or skill, to
    adequately monitor and trade their crypto investments with the frequency required. Due in
    large part to the high volatility that is frequent at times in the crypto space,
    thus active management and oversight of crypto investments can often help better
    capitalize on profits that otherwise may have been lost if positions had not been
    traded on. Additionally, more active oversight of positions facilitates enhanced
    risk management. Now that we have established the reasons that an investor might
    want to allocate capital to a crypto fund manager, we can next discuss the process
    by which a crypto fund would be created.

    money into a crypto brokerage account at an exchange and then to start making
    investments in crypto. This is how retail investors invest in crypto however,
    this is not the same thing as a crypto fund. The primary purpose of a fund on
    the other hand is to pool capital together for the purpose of making investments
    in crypto from multiple people and entities in a single investment vehicle.
  prefs: []

- en: Theoretically, anyone can start a crypto fund. There are no formal legal or
    regulatory minimum requirements as to who can start a crypto-asset fund. A crypto
    fund can be started by a wide variety of different types of people and entities
    and for a variety of reasons. One example would be a single individual who wants
    to start a small crypto fund to manage his friends and family’s investment in
    digital assets. Another example would be a group of individuals who decide to
    organize into a partnership or company in order to pool capital together and centralize
    all of their trading activity. A more traditional example under which a crypto
    fund would be started is under the context of an investment management company
    that maintains employees, operational infrastructure and whose sole purpose is
    to manage investments.

    cases individuals who do not manage large amounts of capital do not find it financially
    beneficial to start a fund. Instead, they simply invest in crypto through direct
    investments in an individual account as opposed to through a fund structure. That
    being said, many so-called smaller investors may start a crypto fund in anticipation
    of raising future capital to grow the fund if they are willing to bear the initial
    and ongoing administrative costs until the fund becomes profitable.

    plan*** or ***pre-launch plan***. This is important because there are multiple
    steps involved in launching a crypto fund. Each of these steps has several different
    moving parts that may need to be executed sequentially or in parallel. Additionally,
    different steps in the fund launch process may involve the use of third-party
    service providers each of which will require coordination. In order to ensure
    the launch plan stays on track, it is also important to develop a ***launch timeline***
    ***or pre-launch timeline***. This timeline will be utilized to keep you on track
    as you go through the multitude of steps involved in starting a fund through to
    until the first crypto trades are made. The typical timeline to launch a fund
    is approximately eight to 16 weeks from the time work begins on starting the fund
    until the first investments are made.

- en: Once you have decided to launch a crypto fund the first step is to define your
    ***investment strategy***. The purpose of the investment strategy is twofold.
    Firstly, it provides an anchor by which you as the investment manager of the fund
    will guide your investment philosophy around. Secondly, the investment strategy
    will provide investors in your fund with a basic idea as to what types of investments
    your fund will be making. As part of the investment strategy, you will also typically
    define the list of what markets and types of securities you will invest in. This
    is known as an ***investment universe***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For a crypto fund for example the broadest definition of the investment universe
    would be all cryptocurrencies. If you plan on investing in all cryptocurrencies
    as an asset manager then this definition would be applicable however, in practice
    the crypto universe is large and growing larger by the day with the rapid growth
    of altcoins. Data suggests there are over 7,800 different cryptocurrencies as
    of December 2020.[¹](#FPar1) It is unlikely therefore that a particular fund would
    set out with the goal of investing across the entire crypto investment universe.
    To help better define the investment universe, a crypto fund manager may define
    the investment universe more specifically to include for example, coins in the
    top 20% of overall crypto market cap.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This type of more specific definition provides better clarity to not only the
    fund manager but also investors as to where the focus of the fund’s investments
    will be. It is important to note that while specificity is important, when starting
    a crypto fund, you should be careful not to define the investment universe too
    narrowly as this will likely preclude too many new investment opportunities that
    may arise in other parts of the market over time. It should also be noted that
    as a crypto manager you have the ability to redefine the investment universe throughout
    the life of the fund as longer term macroeconomic changes might make investments
    in previously uncontemplated areas of the crypto market attractive. Any major
    investment strategy or universe changes should be done either in conjunction with
    investors or at a minimum with their consent.

    that can be invested in it, the best crypto investment strategy in the world is
    essentially worthless. Without capital you simply have a corporate and fund structure
    that are effectively sitting as empty storefronts without customers. In addition
    to requiring capital to make investments, the lack of money in a crypto fund also
    means that you as the manager are not generating management and performance fees.
    Therefore, without money to manage, not only are you not making a profit but actually
    generating losses because of the startup and ongoing costs of maintaining the
    fund, management company and service provider contracts.

- en: Now that we understand why money is essential for a crypto fund, the next question
    becomes where do you raise capital from. To answer this question, we must first
    understand that there are really three categories of investors that capital can
    be raised from. The first and most obvious source of investment capital is from
    yourself and any partners if you have them. These types of investments are commonly
    referred to as ***proprietary capital*** or ***prop capital***. The second source
    of capital can come from people within your social network that you have pre-existing
    personal or business relationships with. This group is typically known as ***friends
    and family capital***. The third group of capital is from new investors with which
    you have had no prior relationship with.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    crypto funds, typically the fund raising process begins with you having informal
    conversations with friends and family to see if they would be interested in potentially
    investing in your fund. Once you have these informal commitments, typically referred
    to as ***soft commitments***, you will have a better idea as to how much capital
    you may have at launch for the fund.

    money into crypto funds are commonly referred to as ***retail investors***. Within
    the category of retail investors, there are a wide spectrum of individuals that
    can be broken down into categories by their overall net worth. This net worth
    calculation would include not just the cash they may have in their bank accounts
    but the overall investible assets they have such as stocks and bonds. Some may
    expand this definition to also include the value of any investments they own,
    real estate holdings, fine art holdings and other assets. Some retail investors
    are on the lower end of the net worth spectrum. These individuals may have only
    a minimal amount in any investments.

    overall higher net worth than others. With this higher net worth comes the ability
    to make larger investments in asset classes such as crypto. This class of retail
    investors can be referred to as ***high-net worth***, and then for those with
    even more net worth, we move to the ***ultra-high net worth*** category. There
    are a variety of different approaches people take to delineating between regular
    retail investors, high-net worth and ultra-high net worth investors. Certain high-net
    worth and ultra-high net worth families opt to create a stand-alone company to
    manage their assets. These are known as family offices or single-family offices.

    net worth and ultra-high net worth groups differently. For example, in the US
    the term, “accredited investor” is defined in the Securities Act of 1933 Rules
    215 and 501(a).[²](#FPar1) Specifically, the term accredited investor was expanded
    in 2020 in Rule 501(a) to include an entity that owns investments of $5 million
    not formed for the specific purposes of investing in the securities as well as
    a so-called, “knowledgeable employee” of a private fund.[³](#FPar1)

    Singapore where under Section 4A(1)(a) of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA),
    Chapter 289 an accredited investor can include an individual whose net personal
    assets exceed in value $2 million (or its equivalent in a foreign currency).[⁴](#FPar1)
    The European Union (EU) under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)
    utilizes the term, “professional clients” for investors that among other criteria
    have a financial instrument portfolio, defined as including cash deposits and
    financial instruments, exceeding €500,000.[⁵](#FPar1) Besides the retail category,
    the other major group of investors are institutional investors. A key difference
    between retail and institutional investors is that institutional investors manage
    capital on behalf of others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    investors typically invest even more larger amounts of capital. Common kinds of
    institutional investors include corporate pension funds, public pensions, insurance
    companies, banking platforms, investment consultants, fund of funds, sovereign
    clients, endowments and foundations. Additionally, there are certain family offices,

    the management company also typically maintains or contracts with vendors for
    employment-related services such as Human Resources, benefits administration,
    certain types of insurance coverage and payroll management. The management company
    will typically serve as an entity known as the ***General Partner*** (GP) of the
    crypto fund investment vehicle. Depending on the specific circumstances of the
    management company and funds, the GP is also sometimes the same entity that is
    the ***Investment Manager*** (IM) of the fund. In other instances, the IM may

    where these items are first purchased or contracted for.

    are maintained by both the management company and the crypto fund. For example,
    both entities would typically engage some type of legal counsel. These could be
    the same law firm for both the management company and the fund or different law
    firms. The fund counsel would provide services related to the management of the
    crypto fund itself whereas the management company counsel would provide more traditional
    corporate legal services directly to the management company. The expenses of the
    fund counsel would be billed directly to the fund as an expense. Similarly, the
    management company counsel would bill their expenses to the management company
    and not the fund. This segregation of expenses is an important concept that is
    reiterated throughout the different service providers engaged by the fund and
    management company.

    the expenses of the fund. There are two broad categories of fund expenses. The
    first are startup costs. These are also sometimes called organizational costs.
    These costs are the initial expenses required to initially start the fund. Examples
    of organizational expenses include hiring a law firm to draft the fund offering
    documents, fund raising costs, expenses for advice from accountants and lawyers
    with regard to fund structuring and tax considerations, and related office and
    technology expenses. The second category of expenses are ongoing expenses. Examples
    of these would be a monthly fund administration fee, audit fees, fees for ongoing
    legal advice, regulatory filing expenses, investment research costs, trading expenses,
    and ongoing office and technology costs for those services utilized by the fund.

    as opposed to attempting to perform the services of a lawyer yourself, the next
    question is which law firm to hire? The choice of a law firm, as with all service
    providers, is an important one that should be made very carefully. One of the
    most important considerations in hiring a law firm should be whether or not they
    have previous experience with cryptocurrency funds. Due to the complex and evolving
    nature of crypto regulations, this experience is effectively a necessity in the
    crypto space. As a general note, many law firms that do fund formation work in
    the crypto space often have historical experience with fund formation across the
    alternative investment space including experience forming hedge fund and private
    equity funds. The general process you can use to evaluate different law firm’s
    competency in crypto fund formation will be discussed in the next section.

    law firms. You can begin to build this list by seeking recommendations from colleagues
    or other individuals in your network that may have started their own crypto fund
    previously. Additionally, you should undertake your own independent research for
    law firms by methods such as visiting the websites of different crypto-focused
    law firms. After you have developed a list of prospective firms you may want to
    work with, the next step would be to contact the firm. This can typically be done
    via a form on the law firm’s website or by directly contacting a particular partner
    at the law firm.

    hiring an accounting firm is similar to the other service providers. You will
    need to review the fund’s experience in the crypto space, understand their costs
    and scope of their offerings. Accounting firms perform can provide a variety of
    standard accounting-related services such as tax advice, tax preparation, management
    company accounting services and employee payroll management. One of the most important
    services the accounting firm will perform is a process known as an ***audit***.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Audits are typically performed for each fiscal year that the fund is in operation.
    In some cases, audits can cover a period of less than a year. This is referred
    to as a ***stub audit***. One common reason for a stub audit would be if you launched
    your crypto fund mid-year (i.e., in June) as opposed to on January 1st and therefore,
    the audit for the first year would be shorter than one year (i.e., the stub).
    It should also be noted that some audits cover a period of greater than a year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common scenario where this occurs is when the stub year is added onto the
    first full year. An example of this would be a fund launched on May 1st, 2020,
    whose audit was not prepared on December 31st, 2020, but instead December 31st,
    2021\. This would be an audit covering a 19 month period as opposed to the standard
    12 month period. The next audit would typically then pickup for a 12 month period
    covering a full year. Different jurisdictions have different regulations regarding
    the permissibility of stub audits. Additionally, certain investors may not want
    stub audits due to the longer time period they cover. Other investors may prefer
    the cost savings associated with spreading out the audit timeline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The result of an audit are financial statements for the funds. These financial
    statements include an audit opinion by the auditor as well as a wealth of financial
    information about your funds including details of investments throughout the year,
    profits earned, valuation of positions and cash balances. The financial statements
    are typically distributed to a crypto fund’s investor approximately two to three
    months after the end of the audit year. For example, if audited financial statement
    were prepared for a fund ranging during a full calendar year (i.e., January 1st
    through December 31st) then the audited financial statements would likely be finished
    and ready to be distributed to investors in March or April of the following year.
    The reason for this delay is because it can often take the auditor several months
    to collect and review all of the appropriate information. The cost associated
    with audits does not typically begin to accrue until the auditor actually starts
    their work.

    company and associated fund vehicles with the financial regulators. The first
    question to consider is whether you can legally open a crypto fund to receive
    investment from third parties. It is likely that you would have already researched
    this issue either by yourself or with your attorney when drafting your fund’s
    legal documentation; however, there may be certain specific requirements in different
    jurisdictions that you should be sure that you are adhering to, as well as can
    provide documentation to support how you meet the requirements. These requirements
    could relate to corporate structure items such as the allowable structures for
    the legal vehicles that you may be allowed to utilize in different jurisdictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, particular jurisdiction's eligibility requirements could be related
    to the individuals associated with the fund at launch. For example, certain key
    individuals who will be involved in the management and operations of the crypto
    fund may need to obtain individual licenses and registrations from regulators
    in addition to registering the management company and funds themselves. An example
    of this in the US would be if an individual who works in a business development
    role and raises assets for the crypto fund may need to pass the Series 7 General
    Securities Representative Exam given by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    (FINRA) prior to working to offer securities for sale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to specific licensing requirements, there may be certain historical
    items that could impact the ability of individuals to be able to launch a fund.
    For example, if the individual who will be the founder of the fund or Chief Investment
    Officer (CIO) is a convicted felon they may be ineligible to start certain types
    of funds. In the US, this restriction is in place Section 9 of the Investment
    Company Act of 1940, which automatically disqualifies any person that has been
    convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanors relating to the purchase or sale
    of securities to, “*serve or act in the capacity of employee, officer, director,
    member of an* *advisory board, investment adviser**, or depositor of any registered
    investment company, or principal underwriter for any registered open-end company,
    registered unit investment trust, or registered face-amount certificate company*.”[⁶](#FPar1)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assuming that you are eligible to launch a crypto fund, the next question to
    consider, whether or not you need to register your fund with financial regulators
    at launch. The answer to this question can depend on different registration requirements
    in the jurisdiction where you plan to launch your fund. For example, in the US
    a fund does not generally need to register as an ***Investment Adviser (IA)***
    with the ***US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)*** if they managed under
    $150 million in ***Regulatory Asset Under Management (RAUM)******.*** For reference,
    these registration requirement thresholds and associated compliance obligations
    are discussed in more detail in Chapter [4](513667_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml). In addition
    to jurisdictional requirements that would generally apply broadly to all proposed
    crypto funds in any jurisdiction, there may also be fund-specific considerations
    that vary based on the unique aspects of you’re the crypto fund you are launching.
    For example, in the Cayman Islands, a popular offshore destination for many fund
    managers, if your fund would only have a single investor, and never intends to
    have more than this, then it may be exempted from registering the fund with the
    Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) as outlined in the Cayman Private Funds
    Law 2020.[⁷](#FPar1)

- en: If you do need to register your fund, the next question is under what classifications
    you will need to register under. Due to a digital asset-friendly regulatory environment,
    the country of Malta has become a popular destination for the opening of blockchain-related
    companies and crypto funds. In Malta, there are a number of different types of
    structures that may be utilized for private funds. These include Alternative Investment
    Funds (AIFs), Professional Investor Funds (PIFs) and Undertakings for Collective
    Investment Schemes (UCITS). Each of these fund classifications has different requirements
    and advantages. Depending on a number of factors including the type and number
    of investors that you are targeting for your crypto fund as well as other items
    such as the tax implications of different fund structures your attorney can likely
    provide guidance as to which fund classification would be most appropriate in
    different jurisdictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is also important to note that in addition to broader country-wide regulations,
    such as the federal ones in a US context referenced above, your fund may also
    be subjected to different state or regional registration requirements as well.
    For example, certain crypto-related businesses may need to be registered on a
    state level with state regulators that are distinct from the federal regulators.

    no formal definition of when a launch technically occurs. Some people may refer
    to the fund as being launched as early as when the initial corporation paperwork
    is filed forming the management company and relevant fund entities. Others may
    refer to the fund as being launched when it actually starts the process of approaching
    investors to gauge their interest in investing in your crypto fund. More commonly,
    however, others will consider a fund to be launched only once it has begun to
    manage capital and actively trade. Regardless of the semantics involved when it
    is appropriate to actually utilize the terms launch, once the fund is launched
    it does not simply run on autopilot in perpetuity but rather it enters what is
    known as the ***post-launch phase***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this phase, many of the considerations involved in the pre-launch plan still
    come into effect. For example, after the initial base of capital raised from investors
    to fund the launch additional capital usually needs to continue to be raised from
    investors. This fund raising process often involves producing a variety of fund
    reporting including market commentary, portfolio and risk analyses, responding
    to new investor inquiries, ***requests for proposal (RFIs)*** and ***due diligence
    questionnaires (DDQs)***. Additionally, there is reporting that must take place
    to existing investors to ensure that they want to both keep their existing capital
    with your crypto fund as well as potentially add new capital on top of their already
    existing investments. This capital from both new and existing investors would
    continue to be raised until the fund reaches what it feels is the maximum level
    of capital that it can appropriately deploy based on the market conditions and
    the crypto fund’s investment strategy. This figure is known as a crypto fund’s
    ***capacity***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, as your crypto fund continues to raise capital it may approach
    certain regulatory assets under management (RAUM), as we noted above, your fund
    may be subjected to additional regulatory registration requirements which also
    must be monitored. With these requirements may also come a host of additional
    compliance and regulatory reporting obligations as well.

    likely need to hire more employees to assist in performing additional tasks as
    well as rely more on the role of service providers. Each of these items needs
    to be overseen on a post-launch basis on well.
