  zh: 大多数供应链基于“上游和下游各一个”的追踪能力。这意味着我可以告诉你我从哪里获得产品输入，以及接下来我将它们发送到哪里。我知道我用来制作奶酪的牛奶供应商，也知道我的成品奶酪被发送到的比萨工厂。我并不一定知道哪些奶牛被挤奶的农民，或者向农民供应食物的公司。
- en: Understanding traceability in food is critical, and even more critical in the
    case of pharmaceutical and regulated products. With these complex supply chains,
    there needs to be complete and fully accurate transparency of the ingredients
    added to the drugs, the environment they were made in, and the environment they
    were kept in. For human prescription drugs, there are many different rules and
    regulations – all of which add significant complexity and costs through the supply
    chain.

  zh: 理解食品的可追溯性至关重要，在药品和受监管产品的案例中更是如此。在这些复杂的供应链中，需要对添加到药品中的成分、它们的生产环境以及它们被储存的环境进行完全和完全准确的透明度。对于人类处方药，有许多不同的规则和法规——所有这些都通过供应链增加了显著的复杂性和成本。
- en: Blockchain technology has the ability to simplify this supply chain and allow
    the regulators access to the data held across the entire chain. If you add to
    this the use of IoT devices, you can track exactly what happens to the drugs,
    and their current status. In [Chapter 14](c14.xhtml), we will discuss the track
    and trace Blockchain solutions, which are growing in usage.

- en: The benefits of improved traceability are clearly shown when there is a product
    recall. It would take an average global retailer around five days to track an
    entire supply chain for an issue, and this can be changed to minutes – possibly
    saving lives if there is a health-related recall, and saving a lot of time and
    resources for a non-critical recall.

  zh: 当发生产品召回时，提高可追溯性的好处显而易见。一个全球平均零售商需要大约五天时间来追踪一个供应链的问题，而这可以缩短到分钟——如果召回与健康有关，可能会挽救生命；对于非关键召回，可以节省大量时间和资源。
- en: 'The clothing and apparel supply chain will benefit from traceability, but not
    to the same extent as the food and pharmaceutical supply chains. Provenance and

    原产地
- en: To me the best description of provenance is the ‘product identification from
    origin to finished product’ where there is complete visibility of all component
    parts. This could be seen as a dream with current technology, but this use case
    is one of the most advanced in terms of delivering results. There have been projects
    working on this for around five years, and they are starting to give some excellent
    solutions to this use case.

  zh: 对我来说，最好的原产地描述是“从原产地到成品的产品识别”，其中所有组件部分都有完全的可见性。这在当前技术下可能看起来像一个梦想，但这个用例在提供结果方面是最先进的。大约有五个项目在研究这个问题，他们开始给出一些非常好的解决方案。
- en: Being able to ‘scan’ a product and find out the exact make-up of the raw materials,
    the journey it took, the stages in the production, and the way it arrived in your
    home, is a significant addition to customer trust and customer loyalty. As I have
    mentioned many times, the world of today lacks trust and transparency, and this
    is the same for most consumer products. If a retailer or consumer brand can prove
    without doubt what the product is made from, a customer could be willing to pay
    more for the product, but they will most certainly trust you more and become more
    loyal.

  zh: 能够“扫描”一个产品并找出其原材料的精确组成、它所经历的旅程、生产阶段以及它如何到达你家，这是对客户信任和客户忠诚度的一个重大补充。正如我多次提到的，当今世界缺乏信任和透明度，这同样适用于大多数消费品。如果一个零售商或消费者品牌能够确凿无疑地证明产品的原材料，顾客可能愿意为产品支付更多，但他们肯定会更加信任你并变得更加忠诚。
- en: As discussed previously, while customer loyalty is difficult to build and even
    harder to retain, provenance of products is something the customers are aware
    of and something they are starting to demand.
