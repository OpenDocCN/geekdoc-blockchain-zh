    this paperless? The first question is: Why haven''t we already made this process
    paperless? Great question, as email has been around for 20 years or more! The
    reason is the lack of trust and the complexity of these shipments.'

    – on behalf of those companies, through to another country and different customs
    regimes. Not only is that complex, but the cargo is often loaded and unloaded
    by a different organization and taken onto land transport by yet another organization.
    There are many organizations involved, as well as the governments and regulators,
    meaning trust must be at the centre of this.

    network would be highly beneficial.

    describe this, and these ownerships need proving in many ways for many different
    reasons. Product certification is an obvious need (and discussed at length in
    the provenance section).

    any digital product (say, music, or this book in electronic form) how are the
    rights of the owners secured? This is where Blockchain technology can make a significant
    impact – by verifying intangible ownership using Blockchain technology, global
    clarity can be obtained regarding who wrote or authored the asset, and who is
    entitled to what rights (especially in terms of royalties and copyrights).

- en: Critically important in any supply chain, but especially the food supply chain,
    is the traceability of all the ingredients from the raw material to the finished
    product on sale to the consumers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In today's complex supply chain, there are some excellent solutions for tracking
    the supply chains, but these are mainly only within certain parts of the supply
    chain and for certain supply chain parties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most supply chains work on a ‘one upstream and one downstream’ tracking ability.
    This means that I can tell you who I received my inputs of products from, and
    where I sent them to next. I know the milk supplier I use for my cheese, and I
    know the pizza factory where my finished cheese is sent to. I do not necessarily
    know the farmers whose cows were milked or the company that supplied the food
    to the farmers for the cows to eat.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding traceability in food is critical, and even more critical in the
    case of pharmaceutical and regulated products. With these complex supply chains,
    there needs to be complete and fully accurate transparency of the ingredients
    added to the drugs, the environment they were made in, and the environment they
    were kept in. For human prescription drugs, there are many different rules and
    regulations – all of which add significant complexity and costs through the supply
    chain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain technology has the ability to simplify this supply chain and allow
    the regulators access to the data held across the entire chain. If you add to
    this the use of IoT devices, you can track exactly what happens to the drugs,
    and their current status. In [Chapter 14](c14.xhtml), we will discuss the track
    and trace Blockchain solutions, which are growing in usage.

    recall. It would take an average global retailer around five days to track an
    entire supply chain for an issue, and this can be changed to minutes – possibly
    saving lives if there is a health-related recall, and saving a lot of time and
    resources for a non-critical recall.

    origin to finished product’ where there is complete visibility of all component
    parts. This could be seen as a dream with current technology, but this use case
    is one of the most advanced in terms of delivering results. There have been projects
    working on this for around five years, and they are starting to give some excellent
    solutions to this use case.

    the journey it took, the stages in the production, and the way it arrived in your
    home, is a significant addition to customer trust and customer loyalty. As I have
    mentioned many times, the world of today lacks trust and transparency, and this
    is the same for most consumer products. If a retailer or consumer brand can prove
    without doubt what the product is made from, a customer could be willing to pay
    more for the product, but they will most certainly trust you more and become more
    loyal.
