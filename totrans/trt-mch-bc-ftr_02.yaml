    a record of exchanges and transactions. What makes this ledger so radical, so
    controversial, is the way in which this record of transactions, known as a blockchain,
    is created and maintained. Bitcoin, released in 2009 by a person or persons using
    the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, was designed to be an end-around to the banks
    and governments that have for centuries been the guardians of our financial systems.
    Its blockchain promised a new way around processes that had become at best controlled
    by middlemen who insisted on taking their cut of every transaction, and at worst
    the cause of some man-made economic disasters.

    payments, private wealth, worker pay. The famous Code of Hammurabi—the Babylonians’

    services have defined the expansion of societies, but this was possible only if
    people could keep track of the exchanges. It wasn’t so difficult for everyone
    in a small village to remember that someone had killed a pig and to trust—a word
    we’ll encounter throughout this book—that all who ate of it would find some way
    to later repay the hunter, perhaps with a new arrowhead or some other thing of
    value. It was another to manage these cross-societal obligations across a larger
    group of strangers—especially when moving outside of kinship boundaries made it
    harder to trust each other. Ledgers are record-keeping devices that help deal
    with those problems of complexity and trust. They help us keep track of all the
    multiple exchanges upon which society is built. Without them, the giant, teeming
    cities of twenty-first-century society would not exist. That said, ledgers are
    not truth itself—not in an absolute sense—for when it comes to matters of value,
    an element of judgment and estimation is always present in the recording process.
    Rather, they are tools for getting closer to the truth, to an approximation of
    it that’s acceptable to all. Problems arise when communities view them with absolute
    faith, especially when the ledger is under control of self-interested actors who
    can manipulate them. This is what happened in 2008 when insufficient scrutiny
    of Lehman Brothers’ and others’ actions left society exposed and contributed to
    the financial crisis.

    like gold coins and paper money are, similarly, record-keeping devices; they too
    aid with societal memory. It’s just that rather than existing within a written
    account of transactions, a currency’s record-keeping function is abstracted into
    the token—the gold coin, the dollar bill. That token is communally recognized
    as conveying some right to goods or services that the bearer has earned from tasks
    performed in the past.

    of a new form of ledger-keeping known as double-entry bookkeeping, an approach
    that was pioneered, as we’ll discuss lower down, by a clique of Renaissance bankers.
    In adopting this bookkeeping, they thrust banking into the payments business and,
    for centuries, helped to greatly expand the capacity for human exchange. It’s
    not an overstatement to say that this idea of banking built the modern world.

    the problem that bankers themselves are not necessarily to be trusted and might
    rip you off with hidden fees and opaque charges. Bitcoin did this by, for the
    first time, entrusting responsibility for confirming and maintaining the ledger
    of transactions to a community of users who checked each other’s work and agreed
    on a common record to represent their shared approximation of the truth. A decentralized
    network of computers, one that no single entity controlled, would thus supplant
    the banks and other centralized ledger-keepers that Nakamoto identified as “trusted
    third parties.” The ledger they collectively produced would become known as the

    transactions could now be instituted peer to peer, that is, from person to person.
    That’s a big change from our convoluted credit and debit card payments system,
    for example, which routes transactions through a long sequence of intermediaries—at
    least two banks, one or two payment processors, a card network manager (such as
    Visa or Mastercard), and a variety of other institutions, depending on where the
    transaction takes place. Each entity in that system maintains its own separate
    ledger, which it later must reconcile with every other entity’s independent records,
    a process that takes time, incurs costs, and carries risks. Whereas you might
    think that money is being instantly transferred when you swipe your card at a
    clothing store, in reality the whole process takes several days for the funds
    to make all those hops and finally settle in the storeowner’s account, a delay
    that creates risks and costs. With Bitcoin, the idea is that your transaction
    should take only ten to sixty minutes to fully clear (notwithstanding some current
    capacity bottlenecks that Bitcoin developers are working to resolve). You don’t
    have to rely on all those separate, trusted third parties to process it on your

    resorted to myriad tricks to bolster its books, those all-important financial
    documents that investors and other stakeholders depend upon to ascertain the risk
    of dealing with an institution. Lehman’s accountants would move billions of dollars’
    worth of debts off the bank’s balance sheet at the end of a quarter and stash
    them in a temporary accounting facility called a repo transaction, a device that’s
    supposed to be used to raise short-term capital, not hide debt. When it came time
    to report, the company didn’t appear to be overly indebted. Once the report was
    in, the company brought the debt back on the books. Really, it was as if the company
    was maintaining two sets of books—one it showed the public, one it kept private.

    offered rules for handling loans, debts, and repayments. The Judeo-Christian tradition,

    lend upon usury to thy brother,” Deuteronomy 23:19–20 declares. “In thee have
    they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast
    greedily gained of thy neighbors by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the
    Lord God,” Ezekiel 22:12 states. As Christianity flourished, this deep anti-usury
    culture continued for more than a thousand years, a stance that coincided with

    also lost nearly all comprehension of math. The only people who really needed

    woven so deeply inside our collective psyche that we’re not even aware of it,
    made us vulnerable to fraud. Even when done honestly, accounting is sometimes
    little more than an educated guess. Modern accounting, especially at the big,
    international banks, has become so convoluted that it is virtually useless. In
    a comprehensive dissection in 2014, the Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine explained
    how a bank’s balance sheet is almost impossibly opaque. The “value” of a large
    portion of the assets on that balance sheet, he noted, is simply based on guesses
    made by the bank about the collectability of the loans they make, or of the bonds
    they hold, and the prices that they might fetch on the market, all measured against
    the offsetting and equally fuzzy valuation of their liabilities and obligations.
    If a guess is off by even 1 percent, it can turn a quarterly profit into a loss.
    Guessing whether a bank is actually profitable is like a pop quiz. “I submit to
    you that there is no answer to the quiz,” he wrote. “It is not possible for a
    human to know whether Bank of America made money or lost money last quarter.”
    A bank’s balance sheet, he said, is essentially a series of “reasonable guesses
    about valuation.” Make the wrong guesses, as Lehman and other troubled banks did,
    and you end up out of business.

    and Pacioli centuries before, he wasn’t the only one working on the idea of leveraging
    the technology of the day to create better systems. In 2005, a computer expert
    named Ian Grigg, working at a company called Systemics, introduced a trial system
    he called “triple-entry bookkeeping.” Grigg worked in the field of cryptography,
    a science that dates way back to ancient times, when coded language to share “ciphers,”
    or secrets, first arose. Ever since Alan Turing’s calculating machine cracked
    the German military’s Enigma code, cryptography has underpinned much of what we’ve
    done in the computing age. Without it we wouldn’t be able to share private information
    across the Internet—such as our transactions within a bank’s Web site—without
    revealing it to unwanted prying eyes. As our computing capacity has exponentially
    grown, so too has the capacity of cryptography to impact our lives. For his part,
    Grigg believed it would lead to a programmable record-keeping system that would
    make fraud virtually impossible. In a nutshell, the concept took the existing,
    double-entry bookkeeping system and added a third book: the independent, open
    ledger that’s secured by cryptographic methods so that no one can change it. Grigg
    saw it as a way to combat fraud.'

    but added to these digitized books would be another function, essentially a time
    stamp, a cryptographically secured, signed receipt of every transaction. (The
    concept of a “signature” in cryptography means something far more scientific than
    a handwritten scrawl; it entails combining two associated numbers, or “keys”—one
    publicly known, the other private—to mathematically prove that the entity making
    the signature is uniquely authorized to do so.) Grigg envisioned his triple-entry
    accounting as a software program that would run within, say, a large company or
    organization. But the third ledger, containing the sequence of all those signed
    receipts, could be verified publicly, and in real time. Any deviation from its
    time-stamped records would be an indication of a fraud. Picture a fraud like Bernie
    Madoff’s, in which Madoff was simply making up transactions and recording them
    in completely fictitious books, and you can see the value in a system that can
    verify accounts in real time.

    of a digital ledger. Nick Szabo was an early Cypherpunk[*](footnote.xhtml#footnote-17991-1)
    and developed some of the concepts that underlie Bitcoin, which is one reason
    why some suspect he is Satoshi Nakamoto. His protocol has at its heart a spreadsheet
    that runs on a “virtual machine”—such as a network of interlinked computers—accessible
    to multiple parties. Szabo envisioned an intricate system of both private and
    public data that would protect private identities but provide enough public information
    about transactions to build up a verifiable transaction history. Szabo’s system—he
    called it the “God Protocol”—is now more than two decades old. Yet it is remarkably
    similar to the blockchain platforms and protocols that we’ll learn about in the
    chapters to come. Szabo, Grigg, and others pioneered an approach with the potential
    to create a record of history that cannot be changed—a record that someone like
    Madoff, or Lehman’s bankers, could not have meddled with. Their approach might
    just help restore trust in the systems we use to transact with each other.

    must find a way to arrive at a commonly accepted foundation of truth. And in the
    digital age of the twenty-first century, when many communities are formed online,
    where they transcend borders and legal jurisdictions, the old institutions we’ve
    used to establish those norms of truth won’t function nearly as well.

    which prevents them from ever being overwritten in the future. Here’s how cryptography
    can achieve what it does: it uses data-protecting codes drawn from a set of possible
    numbers so large that it’s far, far beyond human imagination. The sheer quantity
    of possibilities makes it impossibly time-consuming to discover the hidden code
    through “brute force” guesswork—in other words, by testing and discarding each
    possible number. Consider that Bitcoin is now the most powerful computing network
    in the world, one whose combined “hashing” rate as of August 2017 enabled all
    its computers to collectively pore through 7 million trillion different number
    guesses per second. Well, it would still take that network around 4,500 trillion
    trillion trillion years to work through all the possible numbers that could be
    generated by the SHA-256 hashing algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s data. Let the
    record show that period of time is 36,264 trillion trillion times longer than
    the current best-estimate age of the universe. Bitcoin’s cryptography is pretty
    secure.[*](footnote.xhtml#footnote-17991-2)'

    to work. It needs to open up its sequenced record of traceable, interlinked transactions
    to public scrutiny. This means that (1) the ledger should be public, and (2) the
    algorithm that runs it should adhere to open-source principles, with its source
    code on view for all to see and test.

    and protections for individuals and their data, as people won’t use it if their
    personal identities and proprietary business secrets are open for the world to
    see. Bitcoin deals with this by displaying only the one-off alphanumeric “addresses”
    that are randomly assigned to users when they receive bitcoin and which tell you
    nothing about the identity of the people who control them. But it’s not an entirely
    anonymous system—it’s better described as “pseudonymous.” In Bitcoin it’s possible,
    by following transaction flows from one address to another, to trace the fund
    exchanges to an address where users can be identified—such as when they cash out
    into dollars at a regulated bitcoin exchange that keeps records of its customers’
    names, addresses, and other details. For certain cryptographers who take privacy
    very seriously, that’s not good enough. So a few are developing alternative cryptocurrencies—examples
    include Zcash, Monero, and Dash—that add even more privacy protection than Bitcoin.
    These other cryptocurrencies keep enough information on the ledger so that validating
    computers can be assured that the accounts have not been corrupted or manipulated,
    but do a more complete job of obscuring identities.

    a director at the New America Foundation in Washington and chairman of the Global
    Blockchain Business Council. “We need to establish a common reality that everyone
    can bind to. And the way we’ve done that in developed countries is we have institutions
    that are in charge of establishing those basic facts. Those institutions are under
    fire right now.… Blockchain has the potential to push back against that erosion
    and it has the potential to create a new dynamic in which everyone can come to
    agree on a core set of facts but also ensure the privacy of facts that should
    not be in the public domain.”

    By giving currency users a means of agreeing on the “facts” of their transactions,
    it allowed complete strangers to use an independent currency to pay each other
    securely over the Internet and still have a high level of confidence that counterfeiting
    was impossible, even in the absence of a centralized ledger-keeper like the Federal
    Reserve.'

    a consensus on facts without a central entity arbitrating the process. If we think
    about this as the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari would, in terms of how the
    power of human social organization comes from our ability to craft meaningful
    stories that we all believe in—notions of religion, nationality, common currency—we
    can see how important this is. The history of human civilization is not founded
    on absolute truths per se—after all, even scientific understandings are subject
    to revision—but on an even more powerful notion of the truth: a consensus, a common
    understanding on what we take to be the truth, a society-wide agreement that allows
    us to overcome suspicions, forge trust, and enter into cooperative endeavors.
    The best way to think about blockchain technology, then, is not as a replacement
    of trust—as a “trustless” solution, as some cryptocurrency fanatics damagingly
    describe it—but as a tool upon which society can create the common stories it
    needs to sow even greater trust, to build social capital, and to forge a better
    world.'

    or misplaced—for blockchains as a solution to, well, just about anything. As people
    across a diverse range of fields start exploring its potential to disintermediate
    their industries and create new ways to unlock value, they are seeing in blockchain
    technology the potential for more than just a cash machine. If it can foster consensus
    in the way it has been shown to with Bitcoin, it’s best understood as a Truth
    Machine.
