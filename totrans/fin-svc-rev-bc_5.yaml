    treasury, accounting, and reporting functions of the federal government. These
    activities include controlling all monies drawn from or deposited to the consolidated
    revenue fund and ensuring that all of these transactions are accounted for in
    the accounts of Canada—Canada’s general ledger—and producing the public accounts
    of Canada.

    receiver general implements a control framework, which sees government departments
    submit monthly, aggregated financial information (including all expenditures and
    revenues), which the receiver general reconciles against the general ledgers.
    The control framework is largely based on legacy applications that require human
    intervention, such as file uploads, verifications, and data refreshing. Some of
    these operations are highly time-sensitive, and any snag in the process can have
    severe repercussions.

    to maintain its accounts. This central reporting system compiles a general ledger
    from the certified trial balances submitted by government departments and agencies
    at the end of every month. These monthly departmental trial balances contain opening
    and closing balances for each unique combination of government-wide coding, a

    component of the account balance concept. The RG-GL control account totals are
    based on data received from the treasury systems and internal journal vouchers
    for adjustments not processed through the treasury systems. The PS-GL control
    account totals are based on pay data received from Canada’s Phoenix public service
    payroll system and from internal journal vouchers for adjustments not processed
    through Phoenix.

    account balances in the departmental financial management systems (DFMS) and the
    daily control account totals received from the RG-GL and PS-GL. For example, departments
    receiving internal journal vouchers affecting their control accounts are required
    to manually upload the data into the related accounts in their DFMS and reconcile
    their DFMS account balances with the daily control account totals received from
    the RG-GL and PS-GL.

    data policy dictates that no single piece of information about its citizens should
    be entered twice. Instead of having to “prepare” a loan application, applicants
    have their data—income, debt, savings—pulled from elsewhere in the system. There’s
    nothing to fill out in doctors’ waiting rooms, because physicians with permission
    can access their patients’ medical histories. When a child is born in the hospital,
    his or her parents are automatically registered for family benefits. Citizens
    requiring long-term medication get a digital prescription slip on their medical

    €100 fee and a successful security check will get users an identity card, a cryptographic
    key, and a personal information number (PIN) to access e-services like business
    incorporation and banking. Estonia hopes its e-residency program will appeal to
    entrepreneurs and encourage international start-ups to put down virtual roots.
    Estonia has the lowest business tax rates in the European Union and has become
    known for liberal regulations around tech research. As of January 2018, 28,000

    a new approach the agency calls FASt Lane, a mash-up of Federal Acquisition Services
    (FAS) and Integrated Technology Services (ITS). According to Jose Arrieta, director
    of the General Services Administration’s Schedule 70 (IT products and services)
    operation, “The FASt Lane process can award contracts within 40 days, but only
    when the requirements are very clear.”³²⁷ In 2018, GSA initiated a blockchain-enabled

    its POC will bring the FASt Lane review process down to fewer than 10 days.

    looking to use blockchain to automate intelligently the most time- and labor-intensive
    aspects of the FASt Lane contract review process. The agency expects that automation

    improving the user experience and speeding the awarding of contracts and onboarding

    and onboarding process: the review of vendor-submitted financial statements and
    the preparation of prenegotiation letters. On the financial review, the traditional
    process involved a staffer extracting financial information from material the
    vendor provided and calculating the firm’s financial viability. This alone could
    take up to a month. The blockchain POC accelerated that process so that, in most
    cases, an automated review is “nearly instantaneous,” according to Steven Kelman,
    professor of public management at Harvard University. “Offers that pass are moved

    multiple systems. It has reduced preparation time from 15 to 30 days to fewer
    than 10 days.³²⁹

    of analyzing a proposal by close to 80 percent, according to Arrieta—but it will
    free up staff for more valuable activities. “By automating these business processes,
    we can lessen the burden on our industry partners, and allow the contracting professionals
    to focus more on critical thinking tasks rather than the process tasks associated
    with interacting with multiple systems,” said Arrieta.³³⁰

    transactions, especially when mediating (as GSA does) between thousands of IT
    vendors and thousands of local, state, and federal buyers. Blockchain provides

    process than the traditional system, which required multiple databases. Arrieta
    said,

    operations that can be performed on them. If one wished to introduce new data
    elements or new ways to analyze some data, we had to modify the databases. Multiple

    once instead of logging onto multiple systems, and there is only one shared ledger
    and an open API connecting any user. According to Professor Kelman, “The applications
    that leverage the API for any given user’s needs can be modified as appropriate
    without needing to modify the ledger itself. Also, having only one ledger eliminates
    errors that can creep in when transferring data from one database to another.”³³²

    interactions with vendors, such as requests for proposals, recommendations, and
    decisions, are recorded on the blockchain and viewable by permissioned parties.
    If an offer is rejected, for example, the information affecting that decision
    is available for protests and audits. Transparency also offers vendors access
    to the information in the ledger about them, so that they can detect and report
    any errors. “We’re not going to share multiple industry partners’ information
    with each other,” said Arrieta. So-called permissioned blockchains allow distributed
    ledger managers discretion over who may view data. “But it’s one transparent view
    that multiple stakeholders can see in real time, and it provides a trusted record
    of all of the interactions with one another.”³³³

    blockchain ledger. Although the terms “distributed ledger” and “blockchain” are
    often treated as synonyms, blockchain is a specific type of distributed ledger,
    deployed in situations where parties to a transaction might not fully trust each
    other to agree on ledger updates, that is, one user might not accept the “truth”
    as reported by another user. Instead of using a third party or an offline reconciliation
    process, blockchain uses P2P protocols.

    groups or batches called blocks. When parties broadcast their transactions to
    the network, various nodes on the network verify that the transaction data obey
    the rules and standards of that particular blockchain network and that the existing
    data have integrity. Once a majority of nodes agrees that the data are valid,
    all nodes in the network store the data as a new block in a chronological chain.

- en: Cryptographic hash functions allow users to “hash” data in each block, which
    results in the persistence of a mathematical fingerprint representing the stored
    information. When a new block is assembled, the hashed value of the previous block
    is used to calculate the hashed value of the new block, creating a link between
    the blocks. Each block refers to the previous block, which forms a cryptographically
    linked chain—hence the name, blockchain. The chain’s stored data and data references
    serve as a multilaterally accepted common repository for members of the blockchain
    network. Parties can update data only by appending new information to the ledger
    record.³⁴³

    the verification process, and these trusted parties would be responsible for communicating

    would retain a complete, indelible, and authoritative history of all transactions
    by the government. Entering and verifying transactions directly on the blockchain
    could eliminate time-intensive offline or batch reconciliation processes between
    the RG-GL and the departmental financial management systems.

    receiver general and government auditors would gain near real-time visibility
    into individual transactions, as opposed to aggregated summaries. With realtime
    access to unalterable audit evidence (e.g., agreements, purchase orders, and invoices),
    auditors could improve the pace of financial reporting and auditing. Auditors
    could spend more time probing complex transactions, recommending how to improve
    the efficacy and efficiency of public spending, and ensuring that departments
    have adequate internal controls and processes for measuring and reporting on their
    performance.

    reconciliation process, in particular, will free the receiver general to focus
    more on upgrading the efficacy, timeliness, and transparency of government accounting
    and reporting functions. New roles for the receiver general would include managing
    participants and their various roles in initiating and validating transactions
    on the ledger as well as building external applications that would boost the transparency
    of the government’s reporting process.

    and access control, a permissioned blockchain solution would allow access to identical
    copies of a ledger to a limited number of preselected trusted participants, namely
    each federal department and the receiver general. The benefits of a private or
    permissioned blockchain include faster transaction verification and network communication
    and the abilities to fix errors, reverse transactions, restrict access, and reduce
    the likelihood of outsider attacks. Using a permissioned network, the receiver
    general could choose to assign differing roles to different departments.

    is still an emerging technology and carries some risks for early adopters. Technical
    staff will require training in blockchain and underlying programming languages.
    Most federal departments have aging infrastructure and/or legacy IT systems in
    critical functions, which may impede blockchain adoption. A blockchain system
    will likely not succeed long term unless the participating federal departments
    evolve with it. The receiver general has an opportunity to include a blockchain
    solution in its road map now and to leverage lessons and proven practices of early
    adopters elsewhere.

- en: Proceed with an incremental approach. In light of the implementation challenges,
    and the evolving state of blockchain technologies, the receiver general should
    adopt a cautious and incremental approach to blockchain technology. A proposed
    first step is an in-depth feasibility study of cost and implementation-related
    parameters discussed. As a second step, pending the outcome of the feasibility
    study, the receiver general should work with two or three early adopter departments
    to design and test a POC and run a multiyear pilot to test assumptions and conclusions
    of the feasibility study.

    involved departmental financial managers to understand sunk costs, operational
    costs (i.e., departmental overhead), and costs borne by the receiver general.
    These will be important data when comparing costs and benefits of the status quo
    with blockchain-based processes. The receiver general and departmental financial
    managers should coordinate the tracking and analysis of efficiencies and benefits
    arising from a blockchain-enabled pilot. Given the learning curve and organizational
    adjustments in play, participants may not realize efficiencies and benefits until
    the second year of the pilot, once they better understand its effects on organizational
    design and financial management processes.
