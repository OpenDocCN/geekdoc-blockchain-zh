    treasury, accounting, and reporting functions of the federal government. These
    activities include controlling all monies drawn from or deposited to the consolidated
    revenue fund and ensuring that all of these transactions are accounted for in

    receiver general implements a control framework, which sees government departments
    submit monthly, aggregated financial information (including all expenditures and
    revenues), which the receiver general reconciles against the general ledgers.
    The control framework is largely based on legacy applications that require human
    intervention, such as file uploads, verifications, and data refreshing. Some of
    these operations are highly time-sensitive, and any snag in the process can have
    severe repercussions.

    from the certified trial balances submitted by government departments and agencies
    at the end of every month. These monthly departmental trial balances contain opening

    public or private network. It consists of data records, or “blocks,” aggregated
    into time-stamped chains that cannot be changed or deleted by a single actor;
    instead, they are verified and managed through automation and shared governance
    protocols. As a result, blockchain provides an immutable, transparent record of

    services of government—legislation, voting, education, justice, healthcare, banking,

    file their taxes, submit planning applications, upload their will, apply to serve
    in the armed forces, travel within the European Union without a passport, and
    fulfill around 3,000 other functions with their Estonia ID. Businesses owners
    can use the ID card to file their annual reports, issue shareholder documents,
    apply for licenses, and so on. Government officials can use the ID card to encrypt

    data policy dictates that no single piece of information about its citizens should
    be entered twice. Instead of having to “prepare” a loan application, applicants
    have their data—income, debt, savings—pulled from elsewhere in the system. There’s
    nothing to fill out in doctors’ waiting rooms, because physicians with permission
    can access their patients’ medical histories. When a child is born in the hospital,
    his or her parents are automatically registered for family benefits. Citizens
    requiring long-term medication get a digital prescription slip on their medical
    record, which reduces queues at doctors’ offices and hospitals.

    €100 fee and a successful security check will get users an identity card, a cryptographic
    key, and a personal information number (PIN) to access e-services like business
    incorporation and banking. Estonia hopes its e-residency program will appeal to
    entrepreneurs and encourage international start-ups to put down virtual roots.
    Estonia has the lowest business tax rates in the European Union and has become
    known for liberal regulations around tech research. As of January 2018, 28,000

    of the General Services Administration’s Schedule 70 (IT products and services)
    operation, “The FASt Lane process can award contracts within 40 days, but only
    when the requirements are very clear.”³²⁷ In 2018, GSA initiated a blockchain-enabled

    the preparation of prenegotiation letters. On the financial review, the traditional
    process involved a staffer extracting financial information from material the
    vendor provided and calculating the firm’s financial viability. This alone could
    take up to a month. The blockchain POC accelerated that process so that, in most
    cases, an automated review is “nearly instantaneous,” according to Steven Kelman,

    once instead of logging onto multiple systems, and there is only one shared ledger
    and an open API connecting any user. According to Professor Kelman, “The applications
    that leverage the API for any given user’s needs can be modified as appropriate
    without needing to modify the ledger itself. Also, having only one ledger eliminates
    errors that can creep in when transferring data from one database to another.”³³²

    interactions with vendors, such as requests for proposals, recommendations, and
    decisions, are recorded on the blockchain and viewable by permissioned parties.
    If an offer is rejected, for example, the information affecting that decision
    is available for protests and audits. Transparency also offers vendors access
    to the information in the ledger about them, so that they can detect and report
    any errors. “We’re not going to share multiple industry partners’ information
    with each other,” said Arrieta. So-called permissioned blockchains allow distributed
    ledger managers discretion over who may view data. “But it’s one transparent view
    that multiple stakeholders can see in real time, and it provides a trusted record
    of all of the interactions with one another.”³³³

    system. Therefore, we need a more detailed technical assessment of the extent

    and constantly evolving. Interoperability between blockchain and the leading enterprise
    resource planning and financial management solutions is also advancing; whether
    and how these advances will roll out to existing users in government is unclear.
    Thus, the costs of design and implementation will depend on the state of evolution
    of the component technologies. Given these factors, along with the Government
    of Canada’s experience with the Phoenix pay system, the receiver general should
    adopt a cautious and incremental approach to blockchain technology.

    force to the receipt, and in practice reduces the accounting problem to one of
    the receipt’s presence or its absence. This problem is solved by sharing the records—each
    of the agents has a good copy. … This leads to the pairs of double entries connected
    by the central list of receipts; three entries for each transaction.³⁵¹

    records of each party—such as a buyer and a seller recording the sale and the
    purchase of an asset in their respective books.³⁵³ In this misrepresentation of
    double-entry accounting, the act of recording a transaction on the block-chain
    “creates an interlocking system of enduring accounting records” between the two
    parties, “rather than these entries occurring separately in independent sets of
    books.”³⁵⁴ Hence, the flawed notion of the third entry.

    a blockchain in real time and between multiple parties is powerful. A ledger that

    a credible audit trail but real-time status—the network state—of all transactions
    relevant to the parties.

    independent and isolated departmental ledgers into a single shared ledger that
    would retain a complete, indelible, and authoritative history of all transactions

    access to unalterable audit evidence (e.g., agreements, purchase orders, and invoices),
    auditors could improve the pace of financial reporting and auditing. Auditors
    could spend more time probing complex transactions, recommending how to improve
    the efficacy and efficiency of public spending, and ensuring that departments
    have adequate internal controls and processes for measuring and reporting on their

    critical functions, which may impede blockchain adoption. A blockchain system
    will likely not succeed long term unless the participating federal departments

    parameters discussed. As a second step, pending the outcome of the feasibility
    study, the receiver general should work with two or three early adopter departments
    to design and test a POC and run a multiyear pilot to test assumptions and conclusions
    of the feasibility study.
