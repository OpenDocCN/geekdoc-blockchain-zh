    Believing that lots of taxpayers were ignoring this notice, the IRS served a summons
    on Coinbase in 2016, demanding the company give the IRS records of all its customers.
    Coinbase refused to comply, but after the IRS narrowed the scope of its summons,
    the District Court for the Northern District of California ruled in favor of the
    IRS. Coinbase gave the IRS the data it wanted.

    goods or services is always taxable unless there is a specific exception or exclusion
    in the tax law. The income is the FMV at the time you received it. The income
    you report when receiving digital assets then becomes your tax basis for the asset,
    and you use this data to determine your capital gain or loss when you dispose
    of it.

    (groups of people working together over a network, such as the one provided by
    Norton antivirus software [chapter 6]), or cloud mining (where your contribution

- en: At this writing, the IRS has not provided much clarity regarding the taxation
    of staking and earning staking rewards. Therefore, the cautious approach is to
    consider income generated by staking to be ordinary income as of the time of receipt
    and then have the token become a capital asset as of the day after you receive
    it—so that any subsequent appreciation would be treated as capital gains when
    you dispose of it.^([XXII](footnote.xhtml#footnote-017))

  zh: 我们撰写此文时，美国国税局尚未就抵押和获得抵押奖励的税收问题提供很多澄清。因此，谨慎的做法是将通过抵押产生的收入视为收到时的普通收入，然后在你收到代币的次日将其视为资本资产，这样，任何随后的增值在你处置它时将被视为资本收益。^([XXII](footnote.xhtml#footnote-017))
- en: If you’d rather take a less draconian (and less expensive) position, you can
    ask your tax advisor about treating staking the way rentable property is treated.
    Under that theory, staking rewards could be regarded as rental income (using Form
    1040, Schedule E); doing so offers the potential for lower tax liabilities.

- en: The IRS says a loan is an obligation to pay money, not an obligation to deliver
    property. But at the same time, the IRS says “convertible virtual currency” is
    regarded as property. That’s why this conversation is murky. It’s generally held
    that most digital assets are fungible (other than, obviously, non-fungible tokens),
    but some tax practitioners aren’t so sure that the IRS would agree. If they’re
    right, and ordinary digital assets such as a given bitcoin is “similar to but
    different from” other individual bitcoins, then borrowers (when repaying loans)
    and lenders (when returning collateral) would be returning similar-but-not-exactly-the-same
    property. And if that’s true, these tax practitioners wonder, would the IRS characterize
    the loan as a taxable sale? After all, if you provide a car as collateral for
    a loan but the lender returns to you a different but similar car, the IRS will
    view that transaction as a sale.

    are considered by the SEC to be securities while other digital assets are not.
    If you’re ever in doubt about whether a particular asset is a security, either
    don’t use it until you are sure, or treat it as though it is a security. That
    way, from a regulatory perspective, you are operating in the safest manner possible.'

    prices. This makes valuation far more challenging than for stocks or mutual funds.
    Valuations are important for many reasons. Among them, they determine your AUM,
    which you use to determine the fee you’re charging your client. So, if you’re
    using an incorrect valuation, you’ll be reporting inaccurate account values to
    your client, which could not only impair the advice you’re providing but could
    potentially cause you to overbill your clients.

    However, valuation is a developing area in this field, so your firm must stay
    current on these developments to ensure you’re engaging in best practices. If
    you don’t rely on the custodian’s reported pricing, you need to find another way
    to properly determine valuations. That means finding an independent, reliable
    party—a difficult process for any firm.

- en: The law pertaining to custody for digital assets remains under development,
    but one requirement is that you must only use qualified custodians to hold clients’
    assets. In November 2020, the SEC published a statement acknowledging that “determining
    who qualifies as a qualified custodian is complicated, and facts and circumstances
    based.” Some companies have abandoned efforts to win “qualified custodian” status
    by the SEC and instead seek approval at the state level by becoming a state-chartered
    trust company, which also lets them offer custody services with regulatory oversight
    (albeit by the state and not the SEC).

    do have a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interest of each client—and
    that means having an understanding of which investments are suitable for each
    client. That, in turn, means knowing your client’s investment needs, goals, objectives,
    risk tolerance, and other details, such as any restrictions requested by the client.
    Add it all up and you essentially have a KYC obligation.
  id: totrans-533

    For example, an asset manager who manages a limited portion of a client’s assets
    may not know anything about the client; this is routine for mutual fund managers,
    for example. If that describes your relationship with your client, this must be
    disclosed to the client and reflected in the agreement that the client signs during
    onboarding.

- en: An important part of being a fiduciary is the due diligence you do on the investments
    you recommend. It’s not good enough to say that you provided a digital assets
    security to your clients because they asked for it or because “everyone else”
    is buying it. Keep in mind that the SEC’s February 2021 Risk Alert listed portfolio
    management as a compliance risk—meaning that the SEC is paying attention to the
    digital assets that advisors are recommending to clients. And that includes the
    securities classification of digital assets, due diligence on those assets, risk
    mitigation, and the fulfillment of your fiduciary duty to your clients.
  id: totrans-535
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also not enough to perform KYC actions when initiating a client relationship.
    Instead, your requirements are ongoing. You and your firm should periodically
    request updates from each client about their life and financial circumstances
    so you can make changes as needed to prior recommendations. Even if your client
    doesn’t respond to your request for updates (which is common), you and your firm
    should use common sense and make changes that you know are needed. For example,
    clients who have been with you for twenty years are probably not in the same situation
    as when they met you; proceed accordingly. And if you don’t feel you can act effectively
    in such a vacuum of information, talk with your Compliance Department about terminating
    the relationship.

    coverage they’ll provide. Coverage opportunities will likely increase as the digital
    assets market matures; in the meantime, if you and your firm are not able to obtain
    the coverage you want today, you’ll have to make a business decision about whether
    and how to handle digital assets.

    their portfolios, and other advisors—your competitors—are increasingly meeting
    that need, you may feel that you have no choice but to engage. After all, you
    risk losing clients and AUM if you don’t. In fact, a 2021 survey by NYDIG found
    that 92% of clients expect their financial advisors to be able to give them advice
    about bitcoin, and 62% would switch advisors if theirs couldn’t help them. So,
    you sit on the sidelines at your own risk.

    their holdings of bitcoin? You don’t ask employees if they own baseball cards

    a client sends you an email at 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday to trade shares of IBM,
    you (and they) know they must wait until the market opens for that trade to be
    processed. But digital assets trade 24/7/365—and we know how volatile prices can
    be. So, if you get an email for a trade on Saturday night but you don’t execute
    it until you’re back in the office on Tuesday morning, have you failed to meet
    your client’s expectations? Or worse, exposed yourself to liability? Your client
    agreement, IPS, and ongoing communications can help you avoid disputes or harm
