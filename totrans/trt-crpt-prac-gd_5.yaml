    that most digital assets are fungible (other than, obviously, non-fungible tokens),
    but some tax practitioners aren’t so sure that the IRS would agree. If they’re
    right, and ordinary digital assets such as a given bitcoin is “similar to but
    different from” other individual bitcoins, then borrowers (when repaying loans)
    and lenders (when returning collateral) would be returning similar-but-not-exactly-the-same
    property. And if that’s true, these tax practitioners wonder, would the IRS characterize
    the loan as a taxable sale? After all, if you provide a car as collateral for
    a loan but the lender returns to you a different but similar car, the IRS will
    view that transaction as a sale.

    Valuations are important for many reasons. Among them, they determine your AUM,
    which you use to determine the fee you’re charging your client. So, if you’re

    For example, an asset manager who manages a limited portion of a client’s assets

    you recommend. It’s not good enough to say that you provided a digital assets
    security to your clients because they asked for it or because “everyone else”
    is buying it. Keep in mind that the SEC’s February 2021 Risk Alert listed portfolio
    management as a compliance risk—meaning that the SEC is paying attention to the
    digital assets that advisors are recommending to clients. And that includes the
    securities classification of digital assets, due diligence on those assets, risk
    mitigation, and the fulfillment of your fiduciary duty to your clients.

    Instead, your requirements are ongoing. You and your firm should periodically

    so you can make changes as needed to prior recommendations. Even if your client
    doesn’t respond to your request for updates (which is common), you and your firm
    should use common sense and make changes that you know are needed. For example,
    clients who have been with you for twenty years are probably not in the same situation
    as when they met you; proceed accordingly. And if you don’t feel you can act effectively
    in such a vacuum of information, talk with your Compliance Department about terminating

    are not insured by FDIC or SIPC. This lack of coverage must be part of your analysis
    in deciding whether and how to recommend digital assets to clients.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To obtain coverage for yourself and your firm, contact your insurance provider
    to see if your existing Professional-Liability or Errors & Omissions policies
    cover activities involving digital assets. Ask if you and your firm need additional
    policies, riders, or coverage for providing advice about digital assets and/or
    having discretionary authority over digital assets investments—and be sure to
    obtain this coverage before adding digital assets to your practice since many
    policies do not cover prior acts.

    assets market matures; in the meantime, if you and your firm are not able to obtain
    the coverage you want today, you’ll have to make a business decision about whether
    and how to handle digital assets.

    community, many advisors still simply tell clients, “It’s not something we do.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because clients are increasingly demanding that digital assets be included in
    their portfolios, and other advisors—your competitors—are increasingly meeting
    that need, you may feel that you have no choice but to engage. After all, you
    risk losing clients and AUM if you don’t. In fact, a 2021 survey by NYDIG found
    that 92% of clients expect their financial advisors to be able to give them advice
    about bitcoin, and 62% would switch advisors if theirs couldn’t help them. So,
    you sit on the sidelines at your own risk.

    best for your client. How can you say you’re meeting that standard if you don’t
    even consider digital assets?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    subject, who own digital assets, and what their plans are. By doing this, the
    firm’s leadership is letting everyone know that the firm is paying attention.
    The firm is also learning whom it can turn to for help—because those engaging
    in this space are likely to be more knowledgeable than the firm’s Legal and Compliance
    staff.
  prefs: []

- en: As part of this, you’ll have to resolve your viewpoint on digital assets versus
    digital assets that are securities. Bitcoin and Ether, for example, are not securities,
    according to the SEC, but XRP is. So, will you demand everyone in the firm disclose
    their holdings of bitcoin? You don’t ask employees if they own baseball cards
    or rare stamps—they aren’t securities, after all—so why would you ask about bitcoin?
    And since those who own bitcoin likely realize this, how will you handle objections
    to your inquiry?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be particularly clear with clients—ideally in your client agreement and Investment
    Policy Statement (if you issue one), but also in current conversations and emails—about
    your policy regarding trading hours. The New York Stock Exchange is open Mondays
    through Fridays 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. EST, except for federal holidays. So, if
    a client sends you an email at 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday to trade shares of IBM,
    you (and they) know they must wait until the market opens for that trade to be
    processed. But digital assets trade 24/7/365—and we know how volatile prices can
    be. So, if you get an email for a trade on Saturday night but you don’t execute
    it until you’re back in the office on Tuesday morning, have you failed to meet
    your client’s expectations? Or worse, exposed yourself to liability? Your client
    agreement, IPS, and ongoing communications can help you avoid disputes or harm
    to your reputation.
