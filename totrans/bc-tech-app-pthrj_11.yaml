    the service of retrieving the data from the Internet. Although the data on the
    Internet are huge, the retrieval of data by most of the browsers is minimized.
    Only 5% of the data is retrieved from the Internet that is indexed. Even though
    search engines like Google have an enormous amount of data, all the data cannot
    be retrieved because they are not indexed. The information which is retrieved
    from the Internet is indexed and it is called the surface web. The remaining 95%
    [7] of the web is called the deep web. Four percent of the highly confidential
    information on the deep web is called the dark web. The deep web contains confidential
    data like bank details, Facebook private details, etc., that should not be visible
    to all the people in the world. The criminals are accessing dark web for criminal
    activities with bitcoins as a transaction currency. I2P (Invisible Internet Project),
    Freenet and Tor browser provide access to the dark web that cannot be accessed
    by the normal browser. I2P, Freenet and Tor browser is not created for malicious
    access. It was created with the intention of providing anonymity and protecting
    private data from the Internet. Anonymity provides the protection of data from
    the Internet by hiding the user’s identity on the Internet, but this is leading
    to criminal activities. The Tor browser is used for anonymity, and it is also
    called onion routing.

    on the Internet. With a normal browser like Google, the requested data are sent
    to the Internet service provider and to the Domain Name System where it will be
    verified with the IP address. Each website address on the Internet has an IP address
    to access the website. The Domain Name System provides the service of changing
    the website address to an IP address on request and changing the IP address to
    the website address in response.

    details are not known to the Internet service provider. The Internet service provider
    knows only which browser is accessing now but does not know what content is accessed.
    The Tor browser transfers the data, though nodes, which are already connected
    in the Tor network. The relaying of data in the network node passes through different
    places because the nodes are in different places all over the world. The Tor browser
    provides encrypted data by https add-on service because http is not encrypted.
    Even though onion routing provides anonymity and protects private data, criminal
    activities are increased because of the anonymity. Criminals use the Tor browser
    to do illegal activities like selling guns, drugs, etc. Hitman Network is a website
    that is used for criminal activities such as selling drugs with the exchange of
    money. These criminal activities with exchange of money leads to problems for
    the criminals when it is transferred through a bank. Criminals carry out the transaction
    with cryptocurrency to maintain anonymity. Cryptocurrency has an encryption mechanism
    to protect money from hacking. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that works
    with the blockchain network. The Bitcoin blockchain is a distributed ledger that
    has all the transaction details. The cryptocurrency network carries out the transaction
    without a third party, such as banks. Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto
    and he is the first man entered into the blockchain network. In banking, the transaction
    bank will act as a trusted third party, and it governs all the transactions over
    the network. The dependency on a trusted third party is essential for bank transactions.
    If a bank robbery or a hacking of bank database happens. That will lead to an
    uncontrollable situation. To avoid the third-party trust cryptocurrencies came
    into existence.

    credit card transaction. A Bitcoin transaction shifts the coin from one user wallet
    to another, and the coins are viewed as transactions, in particular, a chain of
    transactions. The destination address (Bitcoin address) is obtained by performing
    hashing operations using the user’s public key. Every user in Bitcoin can have
    multiple addresses by generating several public keys; the addresses can be associated
    with users’ wallets. The owned Bitcoins can be transmitted as digitally signed
    transactions by using the private key of the user. Moreover, it is highly recommended

    key, and the cryptographic signature is created using a private key. The input
    values from previous transactions which are listed in a single transaction can
    be added up and the sum is used by the output of the current transaction. In Bitcoin,
    the output of a previous transaction is exploited as the input of the current
    transaction; often the coin value may be higher than the user desires to pay.
    In this case, the sender creates a new Bitcoin address for getting back the difference
    amount. For example, user B has 100 coins from any of the previous transaction
    output, and he would like to transfer 10 coins to user A using the same output
    as an input in the current transaction. Particularly, user B has to generate a
    new transaction with an input (i.e., the output that user B has received the 10
    coins) and two more outputs. In the output, one shows that 10 coins are being
    transferred to user A, and the other shows the transfer of remaining coins in

    are stored in chronological order. Tampering of data is not possible because of
    the hash technique used in each block creation. Computer systems in blockchain
    connected with each other adhered to the shared data and agreed to certain conditions
    imposed on it. In the beginning, Bitcoin was implemented as a large-scale blockchain.
    Nowadays, Bitcoin’s blockchain is “simple” when compared to other blockchains.
    The ideas of different blockchain projects are growing rapidly. However, the Bitcoin
    architectural components are a digital signature, blockchain, distributed network
    and mining [[12](#re_TNF-CH012_CIT00012)]. A digital signature is an asymmetric
    cryptographic technique created by the user’s private key to assure the corresponding
    Bitcoin address. Bitcoin is also referred to as a cryptocurrency since the digital

    It uses a probabilistic distributed consensus protocol to achieve consensus among
    the communicating nodes. A centralized private ledger is maintained in a central

    user maintains their own copy of the ledger in blockchain. Vulnerabilities arise
    because of maintaining multiple copies of blockchain at many nodes in the network

    If there is any update in the blockchain, the local copy which is maintained in
    all nodes will get updated; the correct state is attained by considering the majority
    of miners’ agreement. Still, this system is vulnerable to Sybil attacks. In this
    type of attack, multiple virtual nodes can be created by the miner and those nodes
    will start sending false information in the network as positive votes for the
    faulty transactions to interrupt the election process. The countermeasure for
    Sybil attack in Bitcoin is to use PoW based on a consensus model; some computational
    tasks have to be accomplished by the miners to prove that they are real entities.
    PoW enforces a high-level computational cost for every transaction verification
    process, and the verification is based on the computing power of a miner. Faking
    computer resources is harder than performing a Sybil attack in the network.

    transactions. A block is mined by computing the hash value with a varying nonce.
    A different nonce value is taken every time until the hash value becomes lower
    than or equal to the targeted value. The target is taken as a 256-bit number that
    is shared among all miners. Computing the desired hash value is extremely challenging.
    Bitcoin uses SHA-256 for calculating the hash value. Every time, different nonces
    (random values) are used for finding the required hash value until the solution
    is obtained. The correct hash value has been found by the miner for a block and
    the block is immediately broadcasted in the network with the computed hash value
    along with nonce. The remaining miners quickly verify the correctness of the received
    block by comparing the hash value with the target value. They will update the

    An increasing number of criminals are using Bitcoin only as an entry and exit
    point.

    enhanced anonymity, which makes them an effective weapon for criminals. Dash and
    Zcash enable users to keep their activity history and balances private, which
    ultimately restricts law enforcement investigators from identifying and tracking
    suspicious transactions. Similarly, Monero uses ring signatures, ring confidential
    transactions and stealth addresses to obfuscate the origins, amounts and destinations
    of transactions.

    to enable its users to switch between public and private ledgers. When the wraith
    protocol is turned on, the transaction data are hidden. Finally, Namecoin does
    not share the same strong anonymity characteristics or goals as the cryptocurrencies
    above but is still identified as a potential threat to police due to its feature
    that allows criminals to anonymously register illegal websites without providing
    any personal information, thus preventing investigators from identifying the administrators
    behind these pages. As an extra layer of protection, many criminals use crypto-mixing/tumbling
    services or decentralized P2P exchange markets to “clean” their “tainted” coins,
    making it increasingly difficult for police investigators to follow their transactions.

    on the development of advanced solutions for tracing criminally linked transactions.
    In particular, police agencies work toward developing forensic tools for the analysis
    of various computing. It is imperative for law enforcement agencies to co-evolve
    with the current state of the art and identify and thwart online criminal activities
    that are linked to cryptocurrencies. [www.computer.org/security](http://www.computer.org)

    wallets, and cryptocurrency hashes; fingerprinting tools for identifying the use
    of mixers/ tumblers in cryptocurrency transactions; clustering solutions for the
    aggregation of the addresses belonging to the same criminal actors for better
    attribution; and cross-ledger tracing tools to support the association of suspicious
    transactions in different blockchains.

    and faces lots of investigating on cryptocurrencies, problems keep on increasing
    day by day. The blockchain is here to stay due to the wide use of cryptocurrencies
    by investors, adopters and pioneers. While it is anticipated that a large number
    of its characteristics will significantly adapt in the near future to overcome
    critical technological shortcomings such as its size and scalability, its use
    for illicit activities will only continue to grow. It is imperative for law enforcement
    agencies to co-evolve with the current state of the art and identify and thwart
    online criminal activities that are linked to cryptocurrencies. For better efficiency
    [[20](#re_TNF-CH012_CIT00020)] in combatting cryptocurrency-related crime, an
    implementation of an international understanding and a legal framework to regulate
    it should be considered; this will enable law enforcement to access information
    for criminally linked transactions and urge cryptomarkets and exchanges to enforce
    strong KYC policies. The solution is required to access Bitcoin network without
    the criminal activities for smooth functioning of the blockchain with cryptocurrency
    in the future.
