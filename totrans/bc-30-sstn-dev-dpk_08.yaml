- en: 'Authentication is a major issue nowadays. Fingerprint authentication plays
    a vital role in the security industry. Blockchain has various benefits such as
    decentralization and persistency. A major wing of blockchain is its limitless
    applications in the field of financial industry, risk management, cryptocurrency
    and security. In this chapter, we propose an approach of secured automatic log-in
    based on fingerprint authentication. The security is enhanced using blockchain
    technology in three steps: in the first step, the user is authenticated using
    fingerprint verification; the second step includes the development of application
    software SDK; finally, security is enhanced using blockchain technology.'

- en: At present, we are more dependent on passwords for security and authentication.
    But how much a password is secured depends on the person’s ability to make a password
    complex enough so that no one can guess it. Password prepared with the combination
    of first name and date of birth can be guessed by any hacker, so one should avoid
    this type of practice while choosing any password. But still we cannot be sure
    that everyone will create or choose a complex phrase for the password. The need
    for a more complex but easy mechanism is getting high day by day to ensure the
    security of data. With the technical advancements in the field of biometric security,
    authentication using fingerprints is used widely in every field.

    be more precise about the security of PINs and passwords. We can take the example
    of the banking sector. A locker at the bank secured with a security PIN can be
    opened easily by electrical shock or using a *PIN* stolen by any other person.
    The proposed method of authentication can remove this type of security threats
    using enhanced fingerprint authentication using blockchain.

- en: At present, we are surrounded by many Internet-of-things (IoT)-enabled devices
    that send and share a massive amount of data. Sometimes these data contain important
    information like passwords and other authentication-related information. To handle
    these large amount of data, big data came into existence and now to secure the
    data we are using blockchain technology for providing a secure platform that uses
    fingerprint recognition-based authentication using any personal devices like personal
    computer, tablet, laptop or mobile, which have a fingerprint recognition unit
    either attached to or embedded to the device. Blockchain provides a more secure
    way for operations related to transactions and secure communications as it is
    based on distributed terminology along with an encryption-based storage facility.
    Thus, the authors are proposing an enhanced fingerprint-based authentication using
    blockchain. Fingerprints for authentication can be taken through the user’s mobile
    or laptop having supporting hardware for recognizing fingerprints and using blockchain
    and sidechain technologies. This chapter focuses on designing robust and “enhanced
    *fingerprint* authentication using blockchain” which handles the security vulnerabilities
    while transferring information in transaction-based operations.

    for proving a secure and safe way of communication. Schutzer et al. [[1](#b_9783110702507-008_ref_001)]
    say that blockchain gives a strong sense of security because blockchain proved
    itself as a cybersecurity solution, which is robust, sustainable and feasible
    to implement. Blockchain enables decentralization of the communication or data
    storage. Instead of storing the secret information in a single repository, data
    are stored at different interlinked computers. Kestenbaum et al. [[2](#b_9783110702507-008_ref_002)]
    say that saving identical information at various interlinked computers helps us
    to deal with security breaches when an attacker tries to update the information
    at one computer in an unauthorized way. The other computer from the network can
    be used to restore the unusual changes made by the attacker.

    account details of users are never stored in a central database. Decentralized
    arrangement of *information* makes it very difficult to access to user wallet
    without having a security key. If the hacker gets the key unfortunately, even
    then he/she will not be able to hack anything due to multiple signature mechanisms
    [[3](#b_9783110702507-008_ref_003)].

    office, airports, and banks. All this information is prone to steal by any hacker.
    Even we are submitting our personal information to various private companies too.
    Hence, data security is the most important aspect to discuss and work upon these

    the security full proof by isolating personal data from the server that handles

    the working terminology of blockchain technology. When multiple parties are involved
    in a transaction, then information of the new transaction is broadcasted on the
    network. This transaction is then noted by all the participating parties. And
    a unique block is prepared. After encrypting these blocks, a hash is generated.
    Records at all parties are updated according to the newly generated block as shown
    in [Figure 8.1](#b_9783110702507-008_fig_001).

    before moving forward. Sidechain provides improvements in terms of scalability
    of performance over the blockchain. The *sidechain* can be thought of as additional
    blocks. These additional blocks allow an user to do transactions within the tokens
    of the main chain. Hence, sidechains improvise the functionality of the main chain
    without compromising on security [[6](#b_9783110702507-008_ref_006), [7](#b_9783110702507-008_ref_007)].

    has to register himself/herself for the first time and provides certain personal
    details. And the same information is used to authenticate the user at the time
    of login. At the time of registration, unique information like mobile number or
    Aadhaar number is taken from every user along with his/her fingerprint. With the
    combination of extracted features of fingerprint and Aadhaar number, an UID is
    created and pushed to a blockchain. The user’s fingerprint is also uploaded on
    the sidechain against the blockchain of UID. Hence, there will be two blockchains:
    the main blockchain contains blocks for *UID*, and a sidechain contains blocks
    for extracted features of the fingerprint.'

    or Aadhaar number and fingerprint are used to create an UID and it will be checked
    for validation. If UID is not present in the system, the user will be redirected
    to the registration page. On successful validation, the user will be asked to
    give a fingerprint impression again on a mobile device. Extracted fingerprint
    features will now be compared with the fingerprint uploaded on the sidechain at
    the time of the registration phase. Based on a high similarity score, all details
    of the user will be accessible from the blockchain and visible on the screen.
    On less matching, an user will be asked to rescan his/her finger. The complete
    process of registration and authentication can be depicted in [Figures 8.2](#b_9783110702507-008_fig_002)
    and [8.3](#b_9783110702507-008_fig_003), respectively.

    handled by socket programming. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) forms can be
    designed for data collection and data transfers. The system will add a new block
    in the blockchain whenever a new user is added through registration. Fingerprints
    are pushed in the sidechain and Unique Identification (UID) is pushed in the main
    chain and initial proofing of work is done. Proof of work is performed by the
    miner to allow the system to create a new block on the blockchain. Secure Sockets
    Layer (SSL) communication and encryption at the server ensures security through
    Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) seed 128 modules.

    are notified about the content available. In turn, all nodes will verify the proof
    of work for its validity. And finally, the new block is added as the last block
    in the blockchain.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Blockchain has proved itself as a safe and secure method for a mode of communication
    in banking and finance and by adding the sense of biometric. The application of
    blockchain can be enhanced in terms of authenticity and trustworthiness. In the
    process, we discussed the inclusion of biometric features contained by sidechain
    and UID or user information in the main blockchain. The use of a sidechain for
    user authentication is also discussed. The accuracy of the system depends on the
    algorithm used to extract the features from the fingerprint and also on the matching
    process. For making the overall process more secure, we can use a combination
    of two or more biometric security features such as palm print, facial expressions,
    and iris.
