- en: In November 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto announced the concept of blockchain in a
    whitepaper about digital payment approach called Bitcoin. Since then, several
    data-driven domains have identified the potential of using this technology to
    provide a secure and a trusted platform for transactions processing. In fact,
    these domains have recognized blockchain as a revolutionized platform of data
    sharing and data storage. Blockchain technology can be presented as a protocol
    or software, which offers a secure transfer and storage of exclusive instances
    of values via the internet and without the need for third-party intermediation.
    From the functional perspective, blockchain can serve as an open, distributed,
    and immutable ledger that records transactions in a verifiable and permanent fashion.
    To understand the revolutionary consideration of blockchain technology, a fundamental
    overview of the technology is required. Accordingly, this chapter will give an
    explanation of blockchain concept, its fundamental features, components, categories,
    and architectures. To emphasize the importance of utilizing this technology in
    several data-driven domains, a section that addresses the usage of blockchain
    technology will be presented. Moreover, this chapter will highlight certain aspects
    related to the future utilization of blockchain technology from Artificial Intelligent
    (AI) and digital privacy implementations.

    these are being implemented using a distributed procedure, that doesn’t require
    a central repository, or central authority, like the government, company, or bank
    [[6](#CR6)]. Keeping in mind the basic level, the user community is enabled for
    recording of transactions within the shared ledger of that community, to make
    sure that the blockchain network operates normally and after publishing the transactions
    cannot be altered. This blockchain concept, in 2008, was integrated with various
    kinds of technologies as well as computing concepts so that modern cryptocurrencies
    could be brought forward. Cryptocurrencies are electronic cash that isn’t protected
    by an authority or central repository but cryptographic mechanisms [[94](#CR94)].

    became widely known. This bitcoin network is one of the first modern cryptocurrencies.
    For bitcoin and other related systems, the digital data transferred indicates
    electronic cash being carried out using a distributed system [[94](#CR94)].

    rights to any other user and a public record is made by the bitcoin blockchain
    for this transfer. Each network participant is provided the opportunity to verify
    the transaction validity in an independent manner [[42](#CR42)]. A participant
    distributed group is responsible for maintenance and management, independently,
    of the bitcoin blockchain. Such a group, integrated with cryptographic instruments,
    allows the blockchain to avoid any sort of changes to the ledger (transaction
    forging or blocks identification) at a later point in time. Through this blockchain
    technology, various kinds of cryptocurrency systems have been developed like the
    bitcoin and Ethereum [[94](#CR94)]. Hence, bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency
    solutions and blockchain technology are usually considered to be bound. Yet, this
    technology can be applied to a significant number of applications and several
    sectors are analyzing its potential [[2](#CR2)].

- en: During the late 1980s and early 1990s, this concept of blockchain technology
    emerged. The Paxos protocol was developed by Leslie Lamport in 1989 and by 1998,
    a consensus model was presented by this author. This model would form agreements
    over an outcome within a computer network in the case where the network or computer
    would be unreliable [[50](#CR50), [94](#CR94)]. During 1991, the electronic ledger
    used was a signed information chain. This ledger allowed document signing in a
    manner that indicated that no signed document within this collection was altered
    [[62](#CR62)]. In 2008, the earlier concepts were integrated with electronic cash
    and referred to as bitcoin. The bitcoin is stated as the peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic
    cash system [[61](#CR61)]. Nakamoto [[61](#CR61)] carried out a research which
    included a blueprint regarding the modern cryptocurrency schemes. There were some
    modifications and variations subjected. Bitcoin was the first out of various blockchain
    applications that were developed [[94](#CR94)].

    were unable to attain extensive application [[6](#CR6)]. Bitcoin, enabled by blockchain,
    could be applied in a distributed manner where a specific user was not allowed
    to control the electronic cash alone and there was no specific failure point present
    either. Hence, the use of bitcoin was highly promoted [[94](#CR94)]. In this system,
    direct transactions could occur among parties and a third trusted party was not
    required [[94](#CR94)].

    that could publish new blocks and manage the ledger copies. In Bitcoin, these
    users are referred to as miners. The miners’ automated payment helped the system
    to maintain distributed administration and organization was not required [[5](#CR5)].
    When the maintenance was based on consensus and blockchain, the self-policing
    policy was established to make sure the transactions remained valid and the blockchain
    included the blocks.

    to the anonymity of the user, however, the account identifiers do not remain anonymous.
    Furthermore, the public can view the transactions. Hence, pseudo-anonymity has
    been offered by bitcoin effectively as the accounts are established without authorization
    or identification processes [[94](#CR94)].

    that established trust within the environment and it wasn’t possible to easily
    identify the users. Earlier, before blockchain technology was used, an intermediary,
    which both parties trusted, was used to deliver the trust. After removing these
    trust intermediaries, the blockchain network helps establish trust through four
    main features of this technology.

    terminologies which create confusion regarding the discussion related to technology
    and how it is implemented. Out of these, there are descriptions associated with
    the transaction grouping as well as publishing. They are formed into unique data
    structures referred to as blocks which are cryptographically linked (chained)
    with each other and spread over the P2P network for the prevention of tampering
    with earlier published transactions [[13](#CR13), [68](#CR68)]. When the transactions
    are embedded within the blocks, it requires validation through the nodes (miners)
    using a consensus model that helps indicate the node given privilege for the next
    block publication [[97](#CR97)]. Blocks also have the ability to support smart
    contract abilities which are expressive and native using a code collection and
    the data is presented with the help of transactions that are signed cryptographically
    over the blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum’s smart contracts, Hyper ledger Fabric’s
    chain code) [[68](#CR68), [97](#CR97)].

    for a payment system that was decentralized and without trust. The blockchain
    technology is included within the Bitcoin [[78](#CR78)], and the cryptographic

    distributed database is included within this blockchain technology and to save
    the entire transaction history within a blockchain, a public ledger is used [[19](#CR19),

    are recorded in the bitcoin blockchain [[16](#CR16)]. The blockchain is observed

    information/ message to the network, where different authentication and validation
    processes will be carried out at the network. In this form, the sender creates
    a transaction that may include the sender’s address, receiver’s public key, the
    transaction’s input, and output values, and the digital signature to prove the
    authenticity of sent information [[8](#CR8), [23](#CR23)]. Transaction inputs

    provides a readable interface where users can keep track of their transactions.
    For instance, Bitcoin wallet software creates and store private and public keys
    that allow users to control the unspent amount of the bitcoin [[75](#CR75)]. This
    layer is collectively controlled by the participants who deploy the application
    code onto the blockchain network when it is operational. The decentralized ledger
    is the intermediary layer in blockchain architecture. This layer reinforces a
    consistent and tamper-proof global ledger for a blockchain architecture. Transactions
    in this layer are grouped into crypto-graphical and linked blocks. The mining
    process in a distributed ledger is used to group transactions into blocks, which
    is added to the end of the recent blockchain. Transactions in this layer can be
    presented as an exchange of tokens between two participants where every transaction
    goes through a validation process before it is considered legitimate. The bottom
    layer in the blockchain architecture is the P2P Network where different types
    of nodes play different roles and multiples messages are exchanged with a decentralized
    ledger [[75](#CR75), [101](#CR101)].

    data into hexadecimal code of fixed length to prevent the inversion to recover
    the original inputs. The authors also proposed the continuous transformation of
    each entry in their sequence into hash code that would be combined with the data

    a transaction. Then this requested transaction is broadcasted to a P2P network
    that consists of nodes of digital devices. After that, the network of nodes will
    validate the transaction and the user status based on specific consensus algorithms.
    A verified transaction can include patient record, cryptocurrency, digital contract,
    or any other data transaction. Once the transaction is verified, it will be linked
    to other transactions to create a new block of data for the distributed ledger.
    This new block will be appended to the existing blockchain. The appointment will
    be observed by presenting the new block in the blockchain in a way that is permanent
    and unchangeable. As the transaction is added to the chain, then we finally can
    state that the transaction is completed [[64](#CR64), [75](#CR75)]. Figure [5](#Fig5)

    efficiency, and consensus determinations. For instance [[75](#CR75)], introduced
    in his research paper ten types of blockchain such as public, private; semi-private;
    fully private of proprietary, sidechains; permissioned ledger; distributed ledger;
    shared ledger; tokenized; and tokenless blockchains. While other research papers

    i.e., permissionless (public) as anyone can publish a new block, and permissioned
    (private) as only particular participants can publish blocks. However, majority
    of blockchain research works such as [[7](#CR7), [44](#CR44), [47](#CR47), [57](#CR57)]
    identified and differentiate between three different blockchain network categories:
    Public (Unpermissioned), Private (permissioned), and Federated (Consortium) blockchains.
    The following sections will explain the main characteristics and differences of
    each category. At the end of this section, a comparison between these categories
    based on different blockchain properties perspectives is outlined.'

    Litecoin, and Ethereum, where interconnected nodes on the network are easily accessible
    by anyone via the internet [[44](#CR44), [47](#CR47)]. Figure [6](#Fig6) shows
    the public blockchain network. Public blockchain consists of an open and publicly
    accessible network, such that any network member can validate a transaction and
    participate in the approval process through the utilization of such consensus
    algorithms as PoW) or PoS [[47](#CR47)]. Participants on a public blockchain network
    do not require to know or trust each other to have a secure transaction transfer.
    Within this trustless platform, transaction validators get rewarded with economic
    incentives for their honest behavior. Accomplishing individual control over the
    entire network is hard to achieve, hence, public blockchains offer very high protection
    level against unauthorized data manipulation [[47](#CR47)]. In fact, a transaction
    on the blockchain ledger is synchronized at all nodes in the network, such that
    anyone who has a computer device and internet connection will be able to register
    as a node and offer a complete blockchain record [[48](#CR48), [75](#CR75)]. The
    repetition of synchronization at each node in the public blockchains network assure
    the security of transaction processes. Moreover, due to the decentralization nature,
    a public blockchain will facilitate true editing resistance.![../images/520662_1_En_1_Chapter/520662_1_En_1_Fig6_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_1_Chapter/520662_1_En_1_Fig6_HTML.png)'

    subject to of poor scalability with gradual and inefficient processing rates of
    transactions validations. Moreover, huge electrical consumption and power supply
    are required to validate each transaction or when each node is added to the network
    [[44](#CR44), [47](#CR47)].

    and centralized to one governing organization [[75](#CR75)]. Private Blockchains
    are based on closed networks, where participants can join the network based on
    special permissions to read, write, and validate transactions. Figure [7](#Fig7)
    shows the private blockchain. Transactions are validated internally by a closed
    group of preselected authorities, which have full control of all stored data.
    A high level of efficiency will be offered in the verification and validation
    of transactions in private blockchain [[44](#CR44), [47](#CR47)].![../images/520662_1_En_1_Chapter/520662_1_En_1_Fig7_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_1_Chapter/520662_1_En_1_Fig7_HTML.png)'

    where all shared data is hardly distributed [[47](#CR47)]. Therefore, data structure
    in private blockchain is not immutable and it loses its ability to provide effective
    data protection against manipulation [[75](#CR75)]. It also enables single point
    of failures, hence, availability and failure tolerance of the stored data is decreased
    [[57](#CR57)]. This category can be represented as a trust transformer such that
    trust is based on an algorithm more than an authority [[48](#CR48)]. Accordingly,
    the participants on private blockchain network should trust a centralized group
    of validators. This concern is reflected in the asset's transfer and on the data
    storage under a specific account. Since all validators know and trust each other,
    the need of economic incentives is not required [[47](#CR47)]. As a malicious
    participant being identified in the network, the validators will directly exclude
    him by their given superordinate authorities. System-wide consensus recognition
    is trivial due to the limited decentralization degree. Private Blockchains are
    highly scalable and they achieve a high rate of transaction processing. For instance,
    Monax, HyperLedger with Sawtooth, private Ethereum, and Quorum represent few examples
    of private and permissioned blockchain [[48](#CR48), [57](#CR57)]. Unlike public
    blockchain, private blockchain does not provide a decentralized system for secured
    database, which has been considered as one of the main limitations of private
    blockchain [[44](#CR44)].

    the former public and private blockchain categories, where some parts of the blockchain
    are private and controlled by a group of individuals or organizations while the
    rest is open to anyone to participate [[57](#CR57), [75](#CR75)]. Thus, federated
    blockchain is a hybrid solution that enables a semi open and publicly accessible
    network that can be presented as partially decentralized [[44](#CR44)]. R3 Corda,
    Ripple (XRP), Stellar, and B3i are blockchain examples related to the federated
    category [[47](#CR47), [48](#CR48)]. The federated blockhain networks are presented
    in Fig. [8](#Fig8). Data transactions are mainly transparent as they could be
    read and written by any network participant. Yet, the validity authorization of
    propagated transactions is a preselected and/or subsequent privilege is given
    to a group of validators that forms a consortium [[47](#CR47), [48](#CR48)]. Every
    member of the consortium will be selected carefully where exclusion can be applied
    for any incorrect behavior.![../images/520662_1_En_1_Chapter/520662_1_En_1_Fig8_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_1_Chapter/520662_1_En_1_Fig8_HTML.png)'

    and know each other, and no economic incentive can is observed since no rewards
    are given for any correct behavior [[47](#CR47)]. For this blockchain category,
    consensus can be established easily as long as no malicious members exist in the
    network [[47](#CR47)]. As result, the complexity of finding consensus is relatively
    low, and hence federated blockchains are easily scalable and the transaction processing
    rates are quite high. Moreover, the decentralization and distribution level of
    all transaction data could be high as well. This depends on the size of the consortium
    and the architecture of the blockchain system. Accordingly, federated blockchain
    might offer an immutable data structure and provide effective security protection
    against data manipulation [[47](#CR47)]. Federated blockchains are also a controversial
    topic as the private ones. For instance, the ability of misusing the power supply
    is still possible in this category, even though the possibility of misusing power
    supply has been lowered by distrusting it between public participants through
    the basics of a transparent consortium [[44](#CR44), [47](#CR47)].

    the main preservations of users. This technology supports all the privacy dimensions,
    i.e., privacy of transactions, machines, networks, and participants using access
    control management that does not require trust in a third party [[102](#CR102)].
    This privacy protection was enabled since the distributed data that is stored
    and travel inside the blockchain network is cryptographically protected [[40](#CR40)].

    just like any newborn technology, blockchain has certain challenges in terms of
    security and specifically in privacy. For instance, among the main concerns that
    were discussed by Peng [[67](#CR67)] are: (i) The extensive computation required
    in the blockchain which may lead to inefficient privacy schemes (ii) The smart
    contract along with its data protection (iii) accountability which requires in
    certain cases to reveal users identity.'
