- en: Beginning with Bitcoin and throughout the early days of the cryptocurrency and
    digital asset space, a fundamental tenant has been a belief in that governments
    and financial regulators should play no role in overseeing the crypto space. This
    is firmly rooted in the decentralized technical framework underlying many crypto
    protocols where no single entity, such as a government or regulator, should have
    the ability to control a cryptocurrency ecosystem. If this lack of centralized
    oversight is such a core tenant of the crypto space, why then do we need to consider
    the regulation of cryptocurrencies?

- en: There are a number of reasons why the speed of regulatory interest in this space
    has increased. One key driver for the increased regulatory attention paid toward
    the crypto space has been the sheer amount of money that has flowed into the space.
    A second motivator for regulatory interest in this space is due to the fact that
    supporting these large capital inflows into the crypto space, there have been
    a host of new technologies and companies engaging with retail consumers and institutional
    investors to facilitate their crypto investment activity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A third reason for increased regulatory interest in this space is due to the
    fact that new types of crypto financial innovation and new crypto product offerings
    may violate pre-existing regulations and laws and, therefore, would require direct
    intervention by the relevant regulatory authorities. A fourth reason for continued
    regulatory interest in this space is due to the perceived threat to traditional
    fiat currency, government financial oversight and central banks that cryptocurrencies
    are classified by some as posing. This enhanced perception of risk, coupled with
    period of large volatility in the crypto space, has often drawn the increased
    attention of both media and government officials that has led to mandates to financial
    regulators to increase their focus on regulating the crypto space. A final reason
    for the regulatory focus in this space has been due to the outright frauds that
    unfortunately have plagued the crypto space resulting in large losses to investors.
    As the number and extent of these types of fraudulent activities have increased
    it has resulted in financial regulators increasing their interest in this area
    as part of their goal in promoting both stability of the financial markets as
    well as protecting investors.

    related to the investing and oversight of crypto markets are simply outside of
    the purview of most financial regulators. While this is certainly not a uniform
    standard, and different countries have taken more pro-active regulatory approaches

    respond to claims of wrongdoing in crypto cases because of crypto’s still status
    of residing largely in regulatory grey areas was the Africrypt Exchange case.
    Africrypt was a South African crypto platform founded in 2019 by brothers Raees
    and Ameer Cajee. The Africrypt platform promised a minimum of five times the amount
    of Bitcoin invested.[^(13)](#FPar1) In April 2020, Africrypt claimed it had been
    hacked and approximately 69,000 Bitcoins worth approximately $4 billion at the
    time had been stolen, but reportedly oddly told clients not to report the hack
    to lawyers or law enforcement authorities as it would slow down recovery efforts.[^(14)](#FPar1)
    Some investors in Africrypt did not follow the firm’s advice and hired a law firm
    to investigate. The law firm, Hanekom Attorneys, stated that their attempts to
    trace and eventually recover the stolen funds had been made more difficult because
    the funds in Africrypt’ s accounts and client wallets had been run through various
    dark web tumblers and mixers.[^(15)](#FPar1)

    law enforcement would likely step in to attempt to coordinate recovery efforts
    or at least begin an immediate investigation. However, in this case that is not
    what happened. The law firm representing investors attempted to refer the matter
    to the Hawks, South Africa's specialist anti-corruption police. It was then reported
    however that a spokesman for the Hawks, Philani Nkwalase, stated that they could
    not open a case for investigation because the attorney was based in one province
    (Western Cape) while those seeking to recover their money were in other provinces
    and that the Hawks, “…advised those individuals to please open cases where they
    are and,” and to “Go to the nearest police station.”[^(16)](#FPar1)

    African financial regulator, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), stated
    that while Africrypt offered exceptionally high and unrealistic returns similar
    to a Ponzi scheme that it can effectively take no action because crypto assets
    were not regulated by the financial sector law in South Africa.[^(17)](#FPar1)
    In June 2021 it was widely reported that the brothers had allegedly disappeared
    and taken the missing Bitcoin with them.[^(18)](#FPar1) Since that time the brothers,
    through their attorney, have denied their involvement in perpetrating the loss
    of assets and reiterated that Africrypt was hacked.[^(19)](#FPar1) Although groups
    such as the South African Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG) have
    advocated for a staged approach for the regulation of the crypto assets, it is
    likely that large-scale crypto losses such as those in the Africrypt case will
    likely continue to shine a spotlight on the needs to increase the speed at which
    regulatory reforms for crypto assets are adopted in order to better protect investors.[^(20)](#FPar1)

    2017, regulators began to focus on developing regulations around ICOs.[^(22)](#FPar1)
    A key legal question surrounding ICOs was whether or not they were securities
    or not. Regulators such as the US SEC have taken the position that ICOs can be
    securities offerings, and therefore may need to be registered, based on specific
    facts and, therefore, would fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction of enforcing federal
    securities laws.[^(23)](#FPar1) An example of when the SEC reiterated the position
    that ICOs could be securities was in a report on The DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous
    Organization (DAO), and the sale of DAO Tokens.[^(24)](#FPar1)

- en: If you are considering an Initial Coin Offering, sometimes referred to as an
    “ICO,” or otherwise engaging in the offer, sale, or distribution of a digital
    asset,^([2]) you need to consider whether the U.S. federal securities laws apply.
    A threshold issue is whether the digital asset is a “security” under those laws.^([3])
    The term “security” includes an “investment contract,” as well as other instruments
    such as stocks, bonds, and transferable shares. A digital asset should be analyzed
    to determine whether it has the characteristics of any product that meets the
    definition of “security” under the federal securities laws. In this guidance,
    we provide a framework for analyzing whether a digital asset has the characteristics
    of one particular type of security – an “investment contract.“^([4]) Both the
    Commission and the federal courts frequently use the “investment contract” analysis
    to determine whether unique or novel instruments or arrangements, such as digital
    assets, are securities subject to the federal securities laws.

- en: The U.S. Supreme Court's Howey case and subsequent case law have found that
    an “investment contract” exists when there is the investment of money in a common
    enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts
    of others.^([5]) The so-called “Howey test” applies to any contract, scheme, or
    transaction, regardless of whether it has any of the characteristics of typical
    securities.^([6]) The focus of the Howey analysis is not only on the form and
    terms of the instrument itself (in this case, the digital asset) but also on the
    circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is offered,
    sold, or resold (which includes secondary market sales). Therefore, issuers and
    other persons and entities engaged in the marketing, offer, sale, resale, or distribution
    of any digital asset will need to analyze the relevant transactions to determine
    if the federal securities laws apply.

    those involving a digital asset, to either be registered under its provisions
    or to qualify for an exemption from registration. The registration provisions
    require persons to disclose certain information to investors, and that information
    must be complete and not materially misleading. This requirement for disclosure
    furthers the federal securities laws’ goal of providing investors with the information
    necessary to make informed investment decisions. Among the information that must
    be disclosed is information relating to the essential managerial efforts that
    affect the success of the enterprise.^([7]) This is true in the case of a corporation,
    for example, but also may be true for other types of enterprises regardless of
    their organizational structure or form.^([8]) Absent the disclosures required
    by law about those efforts and the progress and prospects of the enterprise, significant
    informational asymmetries may exist between the management and promoters of the
    enterprise on the one hand, and investors and prospective investors on the other
    hand. The reduction of these information asymmetries through required disclosures
    protects investors and is one of the primary purposes of the federal securities
    laws.

    is an investment contract and whether offers and sales of a digital asset are
    securities transactions. As noted above, under the Howey test, an “investment
    contract” exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise
    with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.
    Whether a particular digital asset at the time of its offer or sale satisfies
    the Howey test depends on the specific facts and circumstances. We address each
    of the elements of the Howey test below.

- en: Usually, the main issue in analyzing a digital asset under the Howey test is
    whether a purchaser has a reasonable expectation of profits (or other financial
    returns) derived from the efforts of others. A purchaser may expect to realize
    a return through participating in distributions or through other methods of realizing
    appreciation on the asset, such as selling at a gain in a secondary market. When
    a promoter, sponsor or other third parties (or affiliated group of third parties)
    (each, an “Active Participant” or “AP”) provides essential managerial efforts
    that affect the success of the enterprise, and investors reasonably expect to
    derive profit from those efforts, then this prong of the test is met. Relevant
    to this inquiry is the “economic reality”^([12]) of the transaction and “what
    character the instrument is given in commerce by the terms of the offer, the plan
    of distribution, and the economic inducements held out to the prospect.“^([13])
    The inquiry, therefore, is an objective one, focused on the transaction itself
    and the manner in which the digital asset is offered and sold.

    likely to be investment contracts. For example, take the case of an online retailer
    with a fully developed operating business. The retailer creates a digital asset
    to be used by consumers to purchase products only on the retailer's network, offers
    the digital asset for sale in exchange for real currency, and the digital asset
    is redeemable for products commensurately priced in that real currency. The retailer
    continues to market its products to its existing customer base, advertises its
    digital asset payment method as part of those efforts, and may “reward” customers
    with digital assets based on product purchases. Upon receipt of the digital asset,
    consumers immediately are able to purchase products on the network using the digital
    asset. The digital assets are not transferable; rather, consumers can only use
    them to purchase products from the retailer or sell them back to the retailer
    at a discount to the original purchase price. Under these facts, the digital asset
    would not be an investment contract.

    the United Kingdom’s Temporary Registration Regime (TRR) to facilitate compliance
    with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidance and the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering
    Directive. The chapter then proceeded to discuss the New York State Department
    of Financial Services (NYDFS) BitLicense. Next, regulatory case studies related
    to the Africrypt case and alleged violations related to Suspicious Activity Reporting
    (SAR) violations were discussed. The chapter concluded with a discussion of the
    regulatory oversight of ICOs. The next chapter will expand our discussion to include
    additional topics on crypto-related services including their interaction with
    blockchain and distributed ledger technology.
