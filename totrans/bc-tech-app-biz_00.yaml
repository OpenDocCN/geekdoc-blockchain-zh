    followed with skepticism and uncertainty due to the immaturity of this technology
    and its historical connections with the world of financial transactions and trades.
    However, the properties and main features of blockchain can bring considerable
    improvements to businesses and organizations, even when used in non-financial
    applications. How can firms benefit from blockchain technology? How should firms
    modify their business models to accommodate blockchain technology? How will supply
    chain relationships and networks transform when blockchain activates smart contracts?
    These questions challenge firms and businesses as well as governments, international
    bodies, and policy makers. Consequently, society at large requires knowledge on
    blockchain to assess its real potential and evaluate both its business opportunities
    and social implications.

- en: 'One of the first steps to undertake when evaluating blockchain is to modify
    the data management systems to accommodate the new technology. During recent decades,
    firms have experienced important changes in data management due to specific mega
    trends, including corporate social responsibility (CSR), modern solutions like
    Industry 4.0 technologies, or disruptive events like the Covid-19 pandemic. In
    each of these instances, firms have adjusted their business models and data management
    systems to remain competitive and successful. As with e-commerce before and Industry
    4.0 technologies afterwards, blockchain requires significant advancements in the
    digital transformation process. In more recent years, the adoption of digital
    solutions has been both fashionable and appealing due to their potential benefits
    and the role they play in the digital world (Ivanov et al., 2019; Frank et al.,
    2019). However, firms and supply chains require a more comprehensive analysis
    and evaluation of the digital transformation process. Many investments in Industry
    4.0 have been pursued to exploit financial and fiscal opportunities rather than
    to successfully use potential new technology. Therefore, a deep analysis of the
    blockchain is needed to better understand such rapid and increasing trend and
    to recognize whether digitalization through blockchain can supply real business
    advantages and concrete market opportunities along with social and environmental
    benefits (De Giovanni, 2020). In fact, it seems clear that firms need three things
    to understand how blockchain can benefit them: a comprehensive analysis of the
    strategic behavioral changes required to properly select and use blockchain technology,
    an accurate estimation of their economic outcomes, and a careful assessment of
    the implications for the whole supply chain network (Ivanov et al., 2019; Saberi
    et al., 2019).'

    allows firms to perform transparency, verify the originality of raw materials
    and goods, and ensure traceability and business risk mitigation. These targets
    can be achieved by collecting real information about the business model in a digital
    environment, recording them in an immutable dataset, and then making the whole
    batch of information available to all stakeholders, including consumers. In general,
    a blockchain consists of a set of digital applications enabling firms to track,
    trace, and verify how goods move along the supply chain, from the manufacturers
    to the retailers through to the distribution centers and logistics facilities
    (Cole et al., 2019). Such shared information on a blockchain platform allows supply
    chain members to be updated, integrated, and involved in any transaction (Pournader
    et al., 2020); therefore, blockchain seeks to better monitor both the firms’ and
    the suppliers’ actions and activate the smart contracts accordingly (De Giovanni,
    2019).

    of their affairs and competition difficult to identify (Saberi et al., 2019).
    In addition to the intricate network of relationships that firms can establish
    worldwide, issues like inefficient transactions and supplier performance, frauds
    and fake deals, unethical practices and routines, use of environmentally harmful
    processes and supplies, cultural barriers and language differences, international
    regulations and legislative constraints, and lack of trust and commitment of some
    suppliers call for additional information visibility, transparency, and verifiability
    to better manage and control the supply chain network, remove all potential business
    risks, and mitigate the inefficient transactions characterizing the supply chain
    linkages (Dolgui et al., 2019). Blockchain technology enables trustless networking,
    because the parties can make transactions even though they do not trust each other;
    therefore, their applications can considerably increase the chances for firms
    to create an efficient and effective supply chain network (De Giovanni, 2021).

    chain members take into account the complex regulatory, tax, auditability, risk,
    and compliance implications linked to any global transaction platform (Cole et
    al., 2019). Restrictive legislations, reputational pressures, corruptions, fake
    news and products, human rights and gender violations, unknown working conditions,
    and security are only some of the social factors that cannot be handled by using
    traditional data management systems. Today’s firms and supply chains struggle
    to demonstrate their performance in these dimensions, which are quite complicated
    and require intricate verification and communication systems. Instead, blockchain
    can substantially help to achieve these outcomes and leverage the firms’ businesses
    and sustainable actions (De Giovanni, 2021).

    on how firms are currently reengineering their business models to accommodate
    blockchain technology. It sheds light on the business motivations for adopting
    blockchain, the types of improvements the blockchain can guarantee, and the modifications
    occurring in supply chain relationships and offers a comprehensive assessment
    of both the strengths and the weaknesses of blockchain in business, including
    the economic implications. Finally, the book offers thoughts for reflection about
    the possible adoption of blockchain in businesses and organizations through a
    lens on operational changes, contractual agreements and relationships, and emerging

    the blockchain, I hereby present a quick overview of the technical and technological
    aspects of blockchain, including oracles, tokens, and smart contracts. These ingredients
    are common parts of all the chapters of this book and, therefore, this section
    allows readers to quickly get acquainted with how blockchain functions, interacts
    with oracles, generates tokens, and activates smart contracts.

- en: Developed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, blockchain is a distributed dataset system
    that records transactional data after verifying them through a consensus reached
    within a network of relationships. The data recorded in the blockchain are organized
    in blocks, and all parties can recognize and access to transactions through hashes
    (or cryptographic fingerprints) that are impossible to tamper with. Therefore,
    the network of links corresponds to peer-to-peer transactions, which can be either
    based on financial transactions or based on information to be continuously monitored
    and traced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a member of the network initiates a transaction, all details are transmitted
    to the full network, checked by all other users, and recorded if a consensus is
    reached among all these parties. By doing so, the blockchain develops and maintains
    a distributed ledger, that is, a dataset of replicated nodes where information
    is stored in an immutable way. One important element of blockchain is the absence
    of a given entity that controls the transactions. In fact, the blockchain solves
    all issues when the parties of a transaction have different interests through
    smart contracts, protocols, and negotiation clauses. When a transaction is validated,
    it is grouped in a block of other transactions where a cryptographic algorithm
    protects the information; the cryptographic algorithm includes private keys to
    sign any transaction, hash functions to link blocks among themselves, and the
    consensus mechanisms to guarantee the transaction’s irreversibility. If a party
    tries to change any information recorded in the blockchain, the modification can
    occur only if all parties of the network simultaneously agree on that change.
    Therefore, the blockchain mitigates fraudulent behavior in a transaction, either
    based on financial assets or based on operational practices and performance.

    managing data; nowadays, the blockchain technology can represent an important
    new information system that can resolve issues and exceptions, for example, the
    parties’ reconciliation. These are, in fact, managed through digital cryptocurrencies
    and tokens to facilitate the transactions and then mitigate time-consuming and
    expensive bank transfers and oversee conversions and interactions among the network
    parties. The blockchain allows firms to share data within the network to create
    a trustable set of transactions that are regulated by protocols, rules, and standards
    negotiated and set by all network parties. Therefore, the blockchain collects
    and records all data by private networks, intelligent sensors, mobile apps, and
    all possible traditional data sharing and collection systems to make the transactions
    and the quality of the data secured and trustable. By doing so, blockchain can
    create verifiable digital chains through tokens and then unlock business opportunities
    in production, inventory, procurement, quality control, financial assets, and
    promotion. In fact, blockchain provides real-time data to the network from the
    origins of resources to sales, level of stocks, delivery, and after sales services.
    This is an important feature of blockchain technology in supply chain management,
    since end-to-end transactions and their transparency allow small- and medium-sized
    firms to unlock the value linked to features and business peculiarities that are
    real sources of competitive advantages and that are not identifiable through traditional
    ERPs. For large firms, it allows them to properly manage their networks of firms
    dispersed worldwide.

- en: Because the blockchain can potentially change the way businesses are carried
    out and how supply chains are managed, the multiple unanswered questions around
    the technology can result in diffused skepticism throughout firms and organizations
    when they turn to blockchain implementation and adoption. One clear evidence for
    this is that blockchain can lead companies to reach a high level of integration
    without being legally vertically integrated. Therefore, the blockchain allows
    companies to mimic the vertical integration by executing contracts according to
    the parties’ performance and behavior. This is the main smart contract duty, that
    is, executing the contract according to the parties’ real performance. In supply
    chain management, De Giovanni et al. (2016) and De Giovanni (2018) mathematically
    created a contract that is called an incentive mechanism, according to which the
    supply chain members are penalized economically every time one deviates from the
    optimal strategies defined by the vertical integrated solution. While this remains
    a theoretical exercise, the blockchain offers the chance to make this framework
    executable through smart contracts. For example, in a traditional transaction,
    a seller and a buyer agree to finalize a certain delivery in 5 days. In a traditional
    framework, the transaction of money from the buyer to the seller occurs before
    the buyer receives the goods from the seller and, then, when the buyer places
    the order. Afterwards, when the delivery is finalized and the buyer receives the
    goods, the presence of any operational issue like quality, delays, or nonconformities
    induces the buyer to initiate a complaint process that should lead to the parties’
    reconciliation. In contrast, when using blockchain, the buyer does not pay the
    seller when they place the order; rather, a certain amount of digital assets from
    the buyer’s wallet are frozen when the seller sends the goods. Then, the amount
    is unlocked when the delivery is finalized and after the buyer has checked the
    quality of the goods received, reviewed possible delays, or identified any defects
    occurring in the packaging. According to the real performance of the seller, the
    buyer will then decide to pay the seller by unlocking the amount from its wallet.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indeed, this is a very important revolution for supply chain management and
    for negotiation processes in general. All these features must be controllable
    by using oracles, such that the buyer’s information is verified and checked, registered
    in the blockchain, and used to activate the smart contract by also considering
    the possible emerging issues or underperforming situations, such as a clause in
    the smart contract that penalizes the seller if there is a delay. In such a case,
    the smart contract would not unlock the full amount from the buyer’s wallet, but
    rather a reduced amount is automatically computed according to the clause. Through
    these mechanisms, all parties have incentives to stick with the contract terms
    and behave as if they were vertically integrated.

    the blockchain needs access to external data through the oracles present within
    the eco-system and that connect the physical world with the digital world, and
    then allow one to verify and authenticate the smart contract clauses as well as
    to pursue its execution. The oracles can be classified as follows:'

    Tokenisation is the process of creating digital assets and currencies according
    to the contribution provided in verifying the blockchain protocol. These digital
    assets can take the form of fungible and non-fungible tokens. The former are “coins”
    of the same value that are interchangeable and divisible. The latter are unique
    assets corresponding to something special with a value that is not interchangeable
    or divisible. For example, the token linked to a song file is not interchangeable
    or divisible because the properties of that song are unique.

- en: This book proposes a set of case studies and business applications to shed light
    on the motivations that push firms to implement blockchain. A comprehensive analysis
    of the technology’s strengths and weaknesses for each case allow one to appreciate
    its real potential and to better evaluate its possible future adoption. All business
    cases developed in this work highlight the need to undertake two directions. On
    the one hand, light implementation processes are possible when blockchain technology
    should be embedded within a specific function, thus requiring procedures and routines
    to be rewritten. On the other hand, the implementation of blockchain requires
    deep modifications in the business models, the relationships with suppliers and
    consumers, and adjustments to data management systems. The cases reported throughout
    this book show that the blockchain can play different roles within the business
    model. These roles can be either operative, where they aim at increasing the goods’
    traceability, security, and originality, or strategic, where they seek to reshape
    the corporate strategy, modify the supply chain networks through smart contracts,
    and ensure the integration of all business parties spread all over the world.
    Beyond traditional (operational and economic) targets, blockchain turns out to
    be a great technology to demonstrate firms’ social impact and contribution to
    the environment by recording information regarding both pillars. In general terms,
    the blockchain finds promising and fruitful applications when a firm has a competitive
    advantage that cannot be acknowledged by using traditional data management systems.

    technology should be supported by other digital technology to pursue its objectives
    and exploit its full potential. In fact, the blockchain records data and information
    in a digital space, data and information that are received—most likely—by other
    digital technologies like IoT. Furthermore, the cases that are reported in this
    book do not all rely on oracles to make the blockchain work. Instead, oracles
    allow firms to connect the physical world with the digital world and, consequently,
    monitor and manage the physical world through the blockchain and the related smart
    contracts. Future developments and applications should evaluate the possible exploitation
    of oracles to unlock the blockchain’s potential. Finally, this book seeks to highlight
    the real advantages of blockchain technology and how it can be used in practice.
    The readers will then decide whether it is time to either surf this new technological
    wave or stay away from it and take the risk of being disrupted.
