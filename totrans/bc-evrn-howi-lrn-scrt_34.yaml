    was there in the front row with her family, all the kids and grandkids. Kirk,
    Ben, and Evan sat a few rows back with their families, wedged between cousins
    and aunts. I looked back at my brother-in-law’s body, surrounded by flowers and
    wreaths.

    But that’s not the way we think, is it? We think that life should be easy. We
    complain about our hardships. The weather. The president. The line at the grocery
    store.'

    I asked. “I’ve never heard a eulogy where someone just comes out and says, ‘This
    is really difficult.’ It’s always words of comfort. But isn’t it the greatest
    comfort to know that we are not alone, that we all suffer together?

    caterpillar morphing into a butterfly. Think about that for a second. It’s a worm
    with legs, folks. And it turns into this delicate winged angel. You go from bird
    food to the cover of Nature magazine. Do you think that’s easy? Wrapped in that
    cocoon, mutating its body? Got to be difficult.

    we struggle to avoid the wrong things. The struggle is what makes us human. It
    is that struggle that gives us dignity, and worth, and self-respect. Today we
    honor those qualities in Joel.

    did? Can we struggle with this loss, accepting its difficulty but still embracing
    it? Can we look death in the face?” I paused, my emotions pushing for release.'

    I turned to face Joel. “Just as Joel’s was a life worth living.”

    those cheap funeral home speakers came the voice of Johnny Cash singing his version
    of the Beatles classic “In My Life.” And not a young Johnny Cash; this was the
    timeworn, weather-beaten Johnny Cash.
