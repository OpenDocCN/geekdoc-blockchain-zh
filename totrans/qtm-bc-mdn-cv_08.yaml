    through Quantum communications. The major advantages of Quantum Internet include
    the independence of legacy internet, a wide range of secured information transmission,
    and the capability of cutting-edge bling computing. This chapter focuses on four
    primary objectives. The first section focuses on exploring the fundaments behind
    Quantum Computing and the Quantum Internet. The Quantum entanglement, Quantum
    bits, and Quantum states will be discussed in this section. The second section
    focuses on envisioning the Quantum Internet standard architecture. The third objective
    is to explore Quantum Teleportation as a Quantum communication protocol for Quantum
    Internet. Finally, the challenges of Quantum Internet will be discussed. The major
    challenges include de-coherence of quantum information, non-cloning information
    theory, quantum state collapsing, distributed networking of quantum devices.

    with millions of users across the globe. The advancements in cellular technologies,
    high-speed communication networks have resulted in the growth of smartphones,
    mobile devices, and internet applications that are entrenched in conventional
    communication using bits of zero(s) and one(s) [[1](#CR1)]. The upsurge in the
    number of internet and smartphone users has paved a way for eavesdroppers, which
    poses serious challenges for the applications that rely on classical internet
    technology. An increase in the number of cyber-crimes and attacks such as phishing,
    eavesdropping, network injection, and man-in-the-middle has inspired the researchers
    to shift to novel technologies that are primarily secure efficiently. After studying
    the quantum effects, the researchers have paved their way using quantum networks
    that provide privacy, security to users [[1](#CR1)]. It also provides a range
    of capabilities namely metrology, quantum communication, and computation. Quantum
    Internet (QI) involves quantum transmission between several remote nodes via quantum
    channels that are secured by Quantum Internet protocols. The following subsections
    describe the basic techniques used for building Quantum Internet.

    well as other properties of computers that are based on quantum mechanical principles
    [[2](#CR2)]. It is the technique that combines quantum mechanics and computer
    science. The primary objective of quantum computing is to discover quantum algorithms
    that are significantly faster than classical algorithms. In other words, quantum
    computing utilizes a computation device that uses quantum–mechanical phenomena
    namely superposition and entanglement for performing operations on data [[3](#CR3)].
    Some of the common applications of Quantum computing include cryptanalysis, computer
    models for weather analysis or complex chemical reactions, and problems involving
    a great multitude of variables. Researchers are exploring quantum computing as
    the use of quantum effects provides security, privacy, speeds up certain computations
    enormously for instance sometimes exponentially [[4](#CR4)].

    military applications, and life science [[5](#CR5)]. It is defined as a mathematical
    framework or a set of rules for developing physical theories [[6](#CR6)]. For
    instance, there is a physical theory known as ‘*quantum electrodynamics*’ that
    describes the interaction of atoms and light with great accuracy. For enhancing
    the capability of quantum mechanics for a wide range of applications, understanding
    quantum bits and how the quantum system works is of great importance [[7](#CR7)].

    For example, to define the position of a train on a railway track, the conventional
    system uses any number to specify its position whereas in a quantum system we
    use a state vector that is formed with a set of numbers in the form of a vector. Each
    number in the state vector consists of a probable value to find the train at a
    particular place. State vectors are the decent method to keep track of quantum

    output. The strength of quantum logic gates is that they are reversible which
    means the data is not lost with time. Moreover, it is possible to recreate the
    data from the past using quantum gates. There are many gates available that are
    used to perform complex operations in quantum systems. The gates that are immensely

    that two qubits occur in one quantum state. Change in one qubit state will impact
    another qubit state and thus changes it immediately. Entanglement can be created
    in many ways. One way is to place the two qubits closer and perform certain operations
    for entanglement. Once they are entangled they can be moved apart remotely from
    each other. Irrespective of the distance between the two quantum states they will
    remain entangled. This entanglement will be evident in the outcome of a measurement
    on these qubits. Whenever qubits will be measured, it will always yield a single
    state i.e. zero or one perfectly at random regardless of the distance between
    them. There will always be the same outcome.

    there are quantum computers that are connected. Three quantum hardware elements
    are required to create Quantum Internet. The elements are End nodes, physical
    connection, quantum repeaters. End nodes are the quantum computers that communicate
    with each other. The Quantum Internet enables quantum computers to exchange voluminous
    quantum information across far-away distances. It enables the exchange of data
    at a very fast rate that exceeds the speed of light. Physical connections are
    standard channels used for the transmission of qubits between the end nodes. The
    system relies on intertwined particles and a fiber-optic network and finally,
    quantum repeaters allow the qubits to be transmitted at a longer distance as the
    quantum channels are lossy. Quantum Internet is not meant to replace classical
    communication but rather to supplement it with quantum communication [[14](#CR14)].

    well-known application of the Quantum Internet is the quantum key distribution
    (QKD). The key enables two remote end nodes to formulate an encryption key that
    is secured and allows to detect intruders intruding a private communication. With
    the conventional internet, this is impossible. Another application in Quantum

- en: The Internet is defined as a vast network that enables concurrent and synchronized
    long-range conventional communication [[1](#CR1), [15](#CR15)]. The Internet has
    had a radical impact across the globe. The primary objective of a Quantum Internet
    is to primarily improve internet technology by establishing quantum communication
    amongst any two points on the Earth. The advantage of a Quantum Internet is that
    it can function in parallel to the internet as well as connect with quantum processors.
    The rationale behind using Quantum Internet is to enable applications that are
    primarily out of range for the traditional internet. One of the well-known applications
    of the Quantum Internet is the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). It allows two distant
    network nodes to build an encryption key whose security depends on the rules of
    quantum mechanics [[2](#CR2), [16](#CR16)]. Quantum Internet enables the transmission
    of quantum bits (detailed in the above section), which is fundamentally different
    from the traditional bits. Figure [6](#Fig6) describes the basic components required
    to build Quantum Internet.![](../images/516210_1_En_8_Chapter/516210_1_En_8_Fig6_HTML.png)

- en: Quantum Internet comprises fully developed quantum computers that exchange a
    random number of quantum bits. It requires quantum network protocols (detailed
    in section Quantum Internet protocol) for efficient communication and protocols
    that do not need large quantum computers. A quantum device even with a single
    quantum bit at the endpoint is sufficient enough for many applications. The highlighting
    feature of internet protocols is that even the errors can be dealt with the help
    of classical error correction techniques rather than using quantum error correction.
    This enforces fewer demands on the quality and control of the quantum bits. The
    prime reason why the Quantum Internet protocols can outperform conventional communication
    is that their properties rely exclusively on quantum properties, for instance,
    quantum entanglement that can be exploited with very few quantum bits.

- en: Comprehending a Quantum Internet requires substantial development to comprehend
    the quantum repeaters and end nodes and is described in Figs. [3](#Fig3) and [4](#Fig4)
    [[3](#CR3), [17](#CR17)]. Quantum Internet uses simple end nodes to cover long
    distances. First, a physical connection i.e., a quantum channel is required that
    helps in transmitting the quantum bits. The examples include the standard telecom
    fibers that communicate the classical light. Second, a means for extending short
    distances is required as the quantum channels are inherently lossy. Henceforth,
    to reach out to the longer distances, intermediate nodes that are known as quantum
    repeaters are required. Since the transmissivity of the fiber optic channels grows
    exponentially with the distance. The scaling has strong associations for applications
    as for both quantum bit entanglement as well as the key distribution. Achievable
    rates can be relative to the transmissivity. Therefore, the use of repeaters plays
    a very important role. For building a Quantum Internet, repeaters are positioned
    at certain intervals along with the optical fiber.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quantum repeaters are used for transmitting quantum data over long distances.
    The repeater starts by first generating the entanglement in between the repeater
    and each of the end nodes. The repeater then subsequently teleports one of the
    quantum bits entangled with node no. 1 and node no. 2\. This procedure of swapping
    the entanglement allows the creation of entanglement over large distances on that,
    the direct transmission is not feasible. After the establishment of a long-distance
    entanglement, the data qubit can be shared using quantum teleportation [[18](#CR18)]
    and is depicted in Fig. [7](#Fig7).![](../images/516210_1_En_8_Chapter/516210_1_En_8_Fig7_HTML.png)

    With respect to conventional communications, most of the data is protected by
    allocating a shared key for the sender as well as the receiver. Later, a common
    key is used to decipher the data at their respective end. The safety of traditional
    communication relies on an algorithm that creates keys, that are tough for hackers
    to crack, but that is not impossible. Thus, the researchers are trying different
    ways to make this communication process using quantum communication. This concept
    is an evolving field of cybersecurity that is termed quantum key distribution
    (QKD) [[24](#CR24)].
  prefs: []

    conventional data by encrypting the cryptography key into the quantum bits. The
    sender then broadcasts those quantum bits to other entities in the communication
    network, who measures the quantum bits to acquire the key values. This poses extra
    challenges to the hackers and intruders to get the key values and thus, improves
    security.

    are used in today’s era, the users might have limited access rights. Suppose a
    user named ‘Alice’ requests to have limited access to a mainframe quantum computer
    and also shares her crucial information for computation. The result of the computation
    is shared with Alice via a conventional channel. If Alice wants that the result
    of the computation must be shared without revealing her personal information,
    then Alice needs to use the BQC protocol. The protocol allows the user to interact
    with the mainframe quantum computer without displaying sensitive information to
    any other entity (for instance, Bob) that has access to the mainframe computer.

    topology with Entanglement Swapping. The setup initiation configuration file “EntanglementSwapping_Realistic_Layer2_Star_Step_Test”
    was used to run the simulation. The simulation Quantum network consists of 10
    End Nodes, five Repeaters, five Hong–Ou–Mandel effect (HoM) Nodes, and five Routers.
    Each of the repeater nodes consists of quantum network interface cards (QNiC),
    Queuing buffer, Quantum Gates, and photon generators. Figure [12](#Fig12) depicts
    the internal component and functioning of quantum repeaters. There are three quantum
    states namely photon generation, allocation, and consumption.![](../images/516210_1_En_8_Chapter/516210_1_En_8_Fig11_HTML.png)

    under various quantum devices performance parameters. At the link level, the simulator
    provides a complete setup for network topology based on link distance, link error
    rate, and link loss. At the node level, the parameters such as the size of the
    quantum memory buffer, quantum gate error rates, and buffer error rates are measured.
    At the network level, the simulator provides configurability towards 1G/2G/3G
    Quantum Repeaters. The random traffic patterns are captured effectively under
    different complex simulation environments as shown in Fig. [13](#Fig13).![](../images/516210_1_En_8_Chapter/516210_1_En_8_Fig13_HTML.png)

    initiate with the issue of decoherence trailed by the effects of decoherence in
    quantum teleportation, entanglement distribution, design complexity, and the issue
    of the collapse of the quantum states when measured.

- en: Quantum communication occurs whenever electrons travel in the form of waves
    among qubits. Wave functions are used to represent the probabilities of the varied
    quantum states. Two waves are said to be coherent if they have a definite phase
    relationship. This phase relationship among them sometimes gets lost due to changes
    in environmental effects, radiations from objects, change in the magnetic field
    or electric field, etc., which causes loss of information. This process is known
    as decoherence. Due to decoherence, quantum states lose their properties. To maintain
    the coherence among quantum states for infinite time, it is necessary to keep
    isolated which is very difficult to achieve.

    including teleportation or entanglement generation and distribution process. It
    degrades the reliability of teleportation. It also changes the nature of the quantum
    states and hence converts them into mixed states. Generally, the problem of decoherence
    is addressed by entanglement distillation but that required an additional level
    of qubit processing.

- en: The problem in quantum mechanics is that the quantum particle in the form of
    wave function exists in all of its possible states, but while measuring, the particle
    is always detected in only one of its states. This feature is known as the collapse
    of the wave function. Collapse is a black box for a thermodynamically irreversible
    interaction with a classical environment. However, it remains unclear at what
    point in time and under what protocols this transition occurs. The collapse of
    the wave function occurs may be due to the creation of quasi-particles.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The collapse of a wave function presents a real problem in quantum computing
    because errors induced by unavoidable interactions with its environment look very
    much like measurements and can result in the breakdown of the quantum state.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In quantum mechanics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to
    generate an identical replica of an arbitrary unknown quantum state [[8](#CR8)].
    In other words, qubits in quantum computing cannot be copied and any attempt towards
    coping will be detected. In fact, this theorem forces quantum transformations
    to be unitary. This theorem ensures secure communication as it prohibits eavesdroppers
    from creating the replica of the quantum cryptographic keys. At the same time
    transmission of qubits over long distances is a truly formidable task as qubits
    cannot be copied, signal amplification is ruled out as this might create imperfections.
    Therefore, quantum repeaters are required to be deployed. No copied theorem in
    quantum technology doesn’t permit broadcasting so this increases the design complexity
    at the link layer. It is required to be carefully designed. This theorem prevents
    using classical error correction techniques on quantum states. Error correction
    is vital for practical quantum computing. In Quantum Internet, network functionalities
    have to be designed accordingly making the system complex. Such design complexity
    is present in each layer of Quantum Internet.

- en: The entanglement enables communication in Quantum Internet between the remote
    nodes. The entanglement distribution is a prime function in a quantum network.
    Long-distance entanglement distribution is still a key issue due to the decay
    of the entanglement distribution rate as a function of the distance. Quantum repeaters
    help in the entanglement distribution process that is placed in between the source
    and destination nodes. This phenomenon is known as entanglement swapping shown
    in Fig. [14](#Fig14). Using these devices, the entanglement is created among remotely
    placed nodes. In this scenario, decoherence effects on the entanglement distribution
    process can also be mitigated using entanglement distillation in that additional
    qubit processing takes place or error correction for communication between two
    nodes is performed [[7](#CR7)].![](../images/516210_1_En_8_Chapter/516210_1_En_8_Fig14_HTML.png)

- en: Sometimes due to unavoidable environmental effects, entanglement among end nodes
    is lost over time affects the teleportation process. Hence robust entanglement
    distribution techniques are mandatory for the deployment of a quantum network.
    This is one of the difficult challenges in quantum computing. The distribution
    of entanglement determines quantum network connectivity. It determines the teleportation
    capability among the quantum devices. To ensure the entanglement, novel quantum
    routing metrics are required. Despite all these efforts research is still required
    from an engineering perspective.
