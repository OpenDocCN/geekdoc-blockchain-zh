    for all the benefits it can deliver, large enterprises have been slow to adopt
    the technology. In this chapter, I dig deeper into blockchain’s unique capabilities
    and the architecture that underpins its potential and shapes its ability to resolve
    chronic problems with digital transactions. Like other potentially disruptive
    technologies in their early stages, blockchain better meets the needs of nonconsumers
    and narrow customer segments who find legacy solutions on offer overly complex
    and perhaps unaffordable.[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en23) Blockchain is still evolving,
    and I highlight technological drawbacks to using it. Nonetheless, we can see a
    future in which its these drawbacks are resolved and it becomes a commonplace
    feature of enterprise business. Blockchain start-ups, discussed in chapter 2,
    are at the forefront of efforts to gradually overcome these drawbacks. In chapter
    7, when I discuss enterprise blockchain strategy and implementation, I address
    how firms can address economic and organizational impediments to blockchain rollout.

    protocols employ different consensus algorithms to allow network nodes to authenticate

    and proof of stake (PoS) are two commonly used methods for verifying and including
    new blocks. PoW requires network nodes to expend resources, e.g., address a complex
    mathematical challenge, solvable through trial and error rather than algorithmically,
    requiring significant financial investment in computational power. The first node
    to solve this mathematical challenge can earn rewards for authenticating a new
    block. In cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum that use PoW, rewards
    are granted in those cryptocurrencies, which is the process that results in “mining,”
    for example, creating new Bitcoin or Ether (the currencies used in the Bitcoin
    and Ethereum networks, respectively). The complexity of the puzzle can increase
    over time, requiring additional investments in computational power. The significant
    financial resources needed to become the first node to solve the puzzle are a
    deterrent against authenticating false blocks. Benefits from such malfeasance
    would be less than the investment in computer resources needed to control most

    (“bonded validators”) and can lose their stake for dishonest actions. Most of
    the validators need to come to a consensus about the authenticity of a transaction
    before it can be included in a block. Such consensus-based decentralized validation
    prevents dishonest actors from controlling the validation process or approving
    transactions that benefit themselves over the best interests of the counterparty
    and the network. Each node is independent, and all nodes are in a race to be the
    first to meet the conditions set to earn block rewards. If the node that first
    met the set conditions subsequently authenticated a false transaction, it would
    not be in the interest of the other decentralized nodes to authenticate the false

    fraud and corruption. Bitfury collaborated with the Republic of Georgia’s National
    Agency of Public Registry to create a blockchain-based land registry system to
    protect property owners’ rights and to strengthen data security. The company used
    its Exonum permissioned blockchain together with a digital property registration
    process, encrypting the property title with a timestamp and publishing the resulting
    hash. This allowed for verification of legitimate ownership and audit in real
    time as well as, retrospectively, enabling tracing of changes in title.[9](14085-0014.xhtml#en31)

    information access, degree of privacy protection, and other sensitive areas. It
    can also possibly censor transaction flow. For example, as we saw in the introduction,
    Apple and Google exercise significant control over video game distribution and

    sued to stop Apple and Google from using their respective iOS App Store and Android
    monopoly to charge what Epic perceives as excessive 30 percent commission on Fortnite
    sales. A central controlling entity, as a monopoly, could charge higher prices
    and prevent the emergence of contestable markets (in the way Facebook acquired
    WhatsApp and Instagram to reduce challenges to its primacy). Centralization also

    in-game purchases by teenagers with parents’ credit cards, and access and budget

    the harmful climate effects of carbon dioxide emissions, awarding carbon credits,
    in essence an economic incentive to change corporate and individual behavior,
    has become increasingly common. These incentives promote climate-friendly initiatives,
    encouraging a move to carbon-neutral and carbon-efficient processes and activities.
    Carbon credits use a cap-and-trade philosophy, granting carbon credits to firms
    whose carbon emission are below targets set by regulators. These carbon credits
    can be sold to firms whose emissions are above regulatory targets, allowing them
    to use these credits to offset the additional emissions. Carbon credit prices
    will be determined by the demand for such credits from polluting firms, relative
    to the supply of such credits from greener firms. Thus, initially, when pollution
    is high, demand will likely outstrip supply, raising carbon credit prices. Consequently,
    as the more efficient firms sell their carbon credits to less-efficient firms,
    the latter group will divert some of their carbon credit purchase funds to investment
    in emission reduction, thus gradually decreasing global greenhouse gas emissions.
    Further, as emissions targets are gradually tightened by regulators, carbon credits
    increase in price, increasing costs for polluters and further stimulating and

    and title to the clip is what gives the Top Shot clip value and tradability in
    the after-market. In a sense, Top Shots are trading cards incorporating short
    videos rather than static images. Multiple websites display current Top Shot prices;
    for example, the total value of Top Shots featuring LeBron James exceeded $100
    million (as of September 25, 2021).[26](14085-0014.xhtml#en48)

  zh: Top Shot的价值来源于诸如版本大小、稀有度、球员受欢迎程度（即勒布朗·詹姆斯与一位崭露头角的菜鸟）、捕捉的赛事类型及其在比赛中的重要性，以及比赛本身的重要性等因素。潜在买家可以申请购买掉落包（常见的掉落包包含一套三个时刻，序列编号并包装在一起，而价格更高的稀有包则包括一个稀有时刻和几个普通时刻）；这些包的需求大于供应，因此被选中购买包的概率较低。球迷购买这些包的希望在未来的某个时刻，这些包能以远高于购买价格的溢价出售。另一种选择是二级市场，买家在此购买单个时刻，希望其进一步增值。有些收藏家、NBA球迷喜欢拥有比赛片段的真实版本，尽管它很容易在ESPN上看到；NFT证实了片段的原版性和所有权，这赋予了Top
    Shot片段在二手市场的价值和可交易性。在某种意义上，Top Shots是包含短视频的贸易卡，而不是静态图片。[26](14085-0014.xhtml#en48)

    passing basketball season, it remains to be seen whether collector demand will
    continue. Other NFTs may become more desirable, and the infrastructure surrounding
    NFT creation and sale is an important element of this segment. The Flow blockchain,
    which Dapper Labs uses, is designed specifically to facilitate NFT creation and
    marketplaces, and it includes a unique multirole architecture that facilitates
    scalability. Flow deliberately separates roles and splits them between consensus,
    verification, execution, and collection nodes. It uses a newer and easier-to-program
    smart contract language, Cadence, and is designed to be consumer friendly, making
    it easy for users to move from fiat currencies to digital currencies when making
    payments. Dapper Labs’s partnership with the NBA to create the NBA Top Shot business
    enabled it to raise venture capital with a valuation of around $7.5 billion in
    April 2021.[27](14085-0014.xhtml#en49) Table 1.2 summarizes the range of enterprise
    blockchain application possibilities.

  zh: 随着每个篮球赛季的推移，可用于购买的Top Shot时刻数量增加，目前尚不清楚收藏家的需求是否会持续。其他NFT可能变得更加受欢迎，NFT的创建和销售
    surrounding infrastructure是这一领域的关键要素。Dapper Labs使用的Flow区块链专门用于促进NFT的创建和市场，它包括一种独特的多角色架构，以促进可扩展性。Flow故意分离角色并将它们分为共识、验证、执行和收集节点。它使用一种较新且更易于编程的智能合约语言Cadence，并旨在对消费者友好，使用户能轻松地将法定货币转移到数字货币进行支付。Dapper
    Labs与NBA合作创建NBA Top Shot业务，使其能在2021年4月以约75亿美元的估值筹集风险资本。[27](14085-0014.xhtml#en49)

    As table 1.2 suggests, there have been a wide variety of interorganizational applications
    developed, both in business applications as well as in business to consumer initiatives.
    Several independent firms collaborate in these endeavors, with each member putting
    forth their contribution. Each contribution may be relatively small, but together
    these multiple contributions can result in a major breakthrough, a disruptive
    solution with considerable potential.

  zh: 所有这些例子都表明区块链在企业中具有广泛的应用性。正如表1.2所暗示的，已经开发出了各种各样的组织间应用，既包括商业应用，也包括企业对消费者倡议。在这些努力中，几家独立的公司共同合作，每个成员都提出自己的贡献。每个贡献可能相对较小，但这些多个贡献结合在一起可能会带来重大的突破，一个具有相当潜力的颠覆性解决方案。
- en: Despite these successes, blockchain adoption has been slow, due to *technological*,
    *economic*, and *organizational* barriers. In chapter 2, I review technological
    obstacles to blockchain implementation and then discuss several blockchain start-ups
    that are tackling and attempting to overcome these impediments to adoption. I
    also consider start-ups that have developed distinctive business models to gain
    competitive advantage from using blockchain. However, while blockchain start-ups
    have had greater success addressing technological impediments, economic and organizational
    obstacles also require action at the user level, within the firm and its ecosystem.
    I return to the user’s role in resolving economic and organizational obstacles
    at greater length in chapter 7.
