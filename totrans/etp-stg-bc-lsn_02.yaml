    for all the benefits it can deliver, large enterprises have been slow to adopt
    the technology. In this chapter, I dig deeper into blockchain’s unique capabilities
    and the architecture that underpins its potential and shapes its ability to resolve
    chronic problems with digital transactions. Like other potentially disruptive
    technologies in their early stages, blockchain better meets the needs of nonconsumers
    and narrow customer segments who find legacy solutions on offer overly complex
    and perhaps unaffordable.[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en23) Blockchain is still evolving,
    and I highlight technological drawbacks to using it. Nonetheless, we can see a
    future in which its these drawbacks are resolved and it becomes a commonplace
    feature of enterprise business. Blockchain start-ups, discussed in chapter 2,
    are at the forefront of efforts to gradually overcome these drawbacks. In chapter
    7, when I discuss enterprise blockchain strategy and implementation, I address
    how firms can address economic and organizational impediments to blockchain rollout.

    identity to a proven credential, namely income and assets. The *verifier,* in
    this case a bank that maintains that the individual’s checking or savings accounts,
    can verify that balances and direct deposit pay amounts exceed a certain number
    for a certain encrypted identity. The *prover*, the individual who wishes to establish
    proof of financial sufficiency, sends a public key to the *requester*, the real
    estate agent, who can then verify the prover’s identity in a public blockchain
    containing encrypted identities, without knowing any further information about

    money laundering and illegal practices such as financing terrorism and human trafficking.
    Noncompliance can result in large financial penalties and threaten the financial
    institution’s continuing operations. SSI promotes the creation and sharing of
    universal verified identity. Once in place, a universal verified identity eliminates
    the need for repeated identity checks, and it can be used to comply with KYC regulations
    in a variety of settings. Assured identity in turn can be linked to that individual’s
    or entity’s reputation and facilitate direct exchanges of value between identified
    and reputable parties to a transaction.[3](14085-0014.xhtml#en25) For example,

    protocols employ different consensus algorithms to allow network nodes to authenticate
    a block of validated transactions.[4](14085-0014.xhtml#en26) Proof of work (PoW)
    and proof of stake (PoS) are two commonly used methods for verifying and including
    new blocks. PoW requires network nodes to expend resources, e.g., address a complex
    mathematical challenge, solvable through trial and error rather than algorithmically,
    requiring significant financial investment in computational power. The first node
    to solve this mathematical challenge can earn rewards for authenticating a new
    block. In cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum that use PoW, rewards
    are granted in those cryptocurrencies, which is the process that results in “mining,”
    for example, creating new Bitcoin or Ether (the currencies used in the Bitcoin
    and Ethereum networks, respectively). The complexity of the puzzle can increase
    over time, requiring additional investments in computational power. The significant
    financial resources needed to become the first node to solve the puzzle are a
    deterrent against authenticating false blocks. Benefits from such malfeasance
    would be less than the investment in computer resources needed to control most
    of the nodes in the network, a necessary condition to furnish the majority validation
    of transactions and blocks (which the miner knows to be false).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The wasteful energy consumption inherent in performing these PoW calculations,
    and the delay in finalizing payments (successfully completing computations and
    authenticating blocks takes time) have inspired alternative approaches, such as
    PoS. In PoS, potential block validators must post a financial stake to participate
    (“bonded validators”) and can lose their stake for dishonest actions. Most of
    the validators need to come to a consensus about the authenticity of a transaction
    before it can be included in a block. Such consensus-based decentralized validation
    prevents dishonest actors from controlling the validation process or approving
    transactions that benefit themselves over the best interests of the counterparty
    and the network. Each node is independent, and all nodes are in a race to be the
    first to meet the conditions set to earn block rewards. If the node that first
    met the set conditions subsequently authenticated a false transaction, it would
    not be in the interest of the other decentralized nodes to authenticate the false
    transaction. And without a majority of the several decentralized nodes authenticating
    the transaction, the initial authenticating node would not earn the reward.

    and when the container is transferred from a truck to a containership, the change

    a ill-intentioned agent to decipher the series of hashes back to an initial transaction.[5](14085-0014.xhtml#en27)
    Attempts to alter data already included in the blockchain will result in a hash

    costs come down. Dispensing with an intermediary also removes an additional point

    to provide secure and tamperproof inputs and computation. Secure oracle networks
    are one such avenue to trigger smart contract fulfillment, with blockchain utility
    firms such as Chainlink providing applications to source accurate external data,

- en: Carbon Credits and Tokenization As the world’s enterprises attempt to alleviate
    the harmful climate effects of carbon dioxide emissions, awarding carbon credits,
    in essence an economic incentive to change corporate and individual behavior,
    has become increasingly common. These incentives promote climate-friendly initiatives,
    encouraging a move to carbon-neutral and carbon-efficient processes and activities.
    Carbon credits use a cap-and-trade philosophy, granting carbon credits to firms
    whose carbon emission are below targets set by regulators. These carbon credits
    can be sold to firms whose emissions are above regulatory targets, allowing them
    to use these credits to offset the additional emissions. Carbon credit prices
    will be determined by the demand for such credits from polluting firms, relative
    to the supply of such credits from greener firms. Thus, initially, when pollution
    is high, demand will likely outstrip supply, raising carbon credit prices. Consequently,
    as the more efficient firms sell their carbon credits to less-efficient firms,
    the latter group will divert some of their carbon credit purchase funds to investment
    in emission reduction, thus gradually decreasing global greenhouse gas emissions.
    Further, as emissions targets are gradually tightened by regulators, carbon credits
    increase in price, increasing costs for polluters and further stimulating and
    rewarding climate-friendly behavior.

    trading markets, however, is costly and opaque. It raises barriers between enterprises,

    footprint but may find it difficult to clearly identify such firms. In response
    to these market problems, IBM has worked with Veridium Labs[19](14085-0014.xhtml#en41)
    (based in Hong Kong) to develop carbon credit tokens that can be exchanged and
    traded within the Stellar blockchain. IBM pointed out that “by integrating the
    entire process of carbon accounting and offsetting in a token on a public, permissioned
    blockchain network, ownership rights can be transmitted and traded more easily.”[20](14085-0014.xhtml#en42)

    DecorMatters asked users to use the color red and submit bold designs for a variety
    of rooms, including “entryways, living areas, bedrooms, dining rooms, and even
    a patio.” Users (over four million in May 2021) earn rewards for voting on designs,

    came from institutions, with individual retail investors providing most of its

    (i.e., LeBron James versus an up-and-coming rookie), the type of play captured
    and its significance in a game, and the game’s importance. Potential buyers can
    apply to purchase a pack drop (a common pack contains a set of three moments,
    serially numbered and packaged together, with a higher priced rare pack including
    one rare moment and several common moments); demand for these packs is greater
    than supply, so there is a lower likelihood of being selected to purchase a pack.
    Fans purchase such packs in the hope that a pack might yield some moments that
    can be sold individually in future for a significant premium over the price paid
    to acquire the pack. The alternative is the secondary market, where buyers purchase
    individual moments in the hope of further appreciation. There are collectors,
    NBA fans, who like owning the authentic version of a game clip even though it
    can be seen readily on ESPN; the fact that the NFT certifies both originality
    and title to the clip is what gives the Top Shot clip value and tradability in
    the after-market. In a sense, Top Shots are trading cards incorporating short
    videos rather than static images. Multiple websites display current Top Shot prices;
