    data is there for eternity and cannot ever be changed, altered, or destroyed.

    the exact same copy of the data, this means that there is ‘ONE VIEW OF THE TRUTH’.

    found easily and the source of the incorrect information can be traced quickly.  ####

    any organization of any size to get involved. The fact that the technology is
    relatively cheap to test and build (most of the main Blockchain technologies are
    open source and shared) means that we can all try and build Blockchain solutions.
    Of course, the larger business can exploit the tests on a much bigger scale, but
    individual people and start-ups can also use the technology.

    dropping off its latest rider. After dropping the rider off, the car uses its
    profits for a trip to drive to a charging station to recharge its batteries. Except
    for the initial programming, the car does not need outside help to determine how
    to operate and fulfil its role as a driverless car.

    or a DAO, an idea that swirled through the community not long after Bitcoin was
    released in 2009\. The thought is that if Bitcoin can do away with financial middlemen,
    then maybe companies and other organizations can one day operate without hierarchical

    needs to be made, not just those related to money. Essentially, they see it as

    are obvious benefits to these types of organizations, but we are far too early
