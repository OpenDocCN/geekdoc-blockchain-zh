    principle for firms competing in a global digital economy. Rapid innovation and
    competitive advantage have stemmed from designing customer solutions that involve
    capabilities and contributions from multiple independent firms. It is useful to
    ask whether an ecosystem form of organization might be particularly appropriate
    for developing successful blockchain applications.

- en: Blockchain nodes can be distributed across multiple firms in a single industry
    and/or across multiple industries. This introduces the possibility of interorganizational
    collaboration to develop blockchain-based customer solutions, which ultimately
    may perform better than individual competitor offerings. Such interorganizational
    solutions can draw on the multiple capabilities of disparate partners, cocreating
    highly modular, customized customer solutions. These interorganizational blockchain-based
    customer solutions contrast with platform-based solutions where strong network
    effects lead to a few firms, sometimes just one, dominating the platform with
    winner-take-all results. In contrast, blockchain applications based on voluntary
    cross-industry cooperation by independent firms can draw on each participant’s
    distinct but complementary capabilities to create continuously improving customer
    solutions—“a proliferation of ecosystems of ecosystems.”[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en249)

- en: Such blockchain customer solutions do require that the firm step outside its
    organizational boundaries, but the blockchain value proposition increases when
    the blockchain network attracts ecosystem-wide participation. Thus, blockchain
    solutions will often require firms to coexist in an ecosystem, which collectively
    innovates and satisfies customers, enlisting each member firm in the ecosystem
    to choose roles such as orchestrator, innovator, supplier, complementor, intermediary,
    and regulator. Customers can choose between different ecosystem networks to solve
    their problems, and thus ecosystems compete with other ecosystems rather than
    firms competing against one another. However, ecosystems also require significant
    coordination by ecosystem orchestrators, which can be at odds with decentralization.
    As we have seen, some form of permissioned blockchain, with the orchestrator setting
    conditions of access to and levels of participation in the network, is often where
    enterprises have landed in their own pilots.

    design an inclusive ecosystem model, and, conversely, firms within the ecosystem
    have to assess whether to join the ecosystem by weighing the potential benefits,
    their possible role in the ecosystem, and the risks of becoming dependent on and
    subordinate to the dominant blockchain orchestrator. Ecosystem complexity, stemming
    from several interacting subsystems, can be a motivator for likely members as
    membership in such blockchain networks allows the members to collectively offer
    solutions beyond the capabilities of any single member. At the same time, ecosystem
    members’ preference for a more participatory governance blockchain may run counter
    to the design imposed by dominant network initiators and programmed into the specific
    blockchain rules and architecture.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en250)

    needs to weigh ecosystems against hierarchically organized supply chains and/or
    a vertically integrated firm with the enterprise playing a central role. When
    modular components are fitted to shape the customer solution, ecosystem models
    are likely to be superior to vertically integrated and hierarchical organizations.

    is a fundamental step as the protocol needs to be adopted by all would-be ecosystem
    members. Ecosystem members as well as visitors and potential customers would be
    recognized by unique, verifiable digital identities. Members would agree on APIs
    facilitating visitor access and third-party add-ons and rules governing data flows,
    data analytics, links to IoT networks, and cloud infrastructure. Equally important
    are the products and services featured in the blockchain, with the intent to provide
    an integrated solution. However, as the number of users and providers grow, blockchain
    speed and scalability issues could be a hindrance to offering fast service and

    be key to building the network and recruiting partners, with other members joining

    the network would become a strategic consideration.[6](14085-0014.xhtml#en254)
    This is essential to expand content and capabilities, which can in turn generate
    new products and services. The growth path would cover evolving customer solutions,

    Likewise, monetization paths are an essential element of ecosystem strategy. A
    fundamental decision surrounds the question of who pays. Ecosystem orchestrators
    and members could choose between charging providers, users, or both. Charging
    providers implies that members derive significant benefit from participating in
    the ecosystem and are paying the ecosystem network for deal flow. Alternatively,
    customers could be charged a fee for service. The fees charged could vary over
    time with volume and usage, complexity of service provided, and value delivered.
    Further, ecosystems need both providers and partners, with network effects multiplying
    in a burgeoning symbiotic relationship between the numbers of providers and customers.

    fees, and a discount structure can hasten the generation of network effects.

    organizational change as the organization and its members move from hierarchy

    members. Corporate culture must now modulate a competitive ethos of rivalry and
    pursue interorganizational collaboration, following a path to informed consensus.
    Alongside the broader move to ecosystems, the organization must cope with the
    move to an unfamiliar technology—blockchain. Some fear and resistance to change
    is to be expected over replacing legacy solutions with blockchain-based solutions,
    and high-level organizational champions can help reduce anxiety over such moves.
    Education about blockchain is a necessary corollary to turn resistance into understanding
    and even informed enthusiasm. Well-designed pilots can be part of the educational
    effort, proving the concept and establishing functionality and the business case
    for a switch to blockchain. Enterprises often resort to temporary parallel tracks,

    the competitive balance in the automobile industry. Traditionally, a few major
    automobile firms, such as General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen, have dominated
    the global industry, with both vertically integrated manufacturing and distribution,
    complemented by hierarchically organized suppliers arranged in tiers. The move
    to AVs, along with the growing importance of electric vehicles, has disturbed
    the traditional hierarchically organized auto industry and has forced it to consider
    shifting to an ecosystem-based organization.
  prefs: []

    elements underpinning AV’s emergence. Manufacturing driverless cars requires firms
    with distinct technology capabilities, from traditional automobile manufacturing
    to developing software and AI systems, and electronic and optical devices to voluntarily
    collaborate if they are to come up with a superior customer solution. AVs bundle
    several distinct technological innovations to provide transportation services.
    They require vehicle-driving software linked with AI capabilities to rapidly process
    and respond to the torrent of data about the driving environment in real time.
    The software links with multiple sensors such as vision recognition systems, navigation
    systems and their associated maps, mobile connectivity with cloud servers and
    data lakes, and powerful onboard computing capabilities (graphic processing units).
    Driving directions are communicated via onboard electronics and software to the
    car’s mechanical systems—wheels, engine power, steering and direction, brakes—thus
    controlling the vehicle’s motion. Replacing human drivers with automation increases
    the electronics and software content of vehicles and rearranges the value contribution
    and profit distribution across the value chain. These newer technologies are outside
    the traditional domain expertise of the major automobile firms.

    increasingly attractive to new technology providers. For example, AV software
    leaders include Google’s Waymo unit, which uses simulation and data derived from
    its pilot fleet of experimental AV cars driven in its Arizona test facility to
    continuously update its AV software. Tesla relies on AI machine learning, mining
    driving performance data from Tesla owners using their cars on the road to inductively
    develop its AV software. Car electronics to aid autonomous driving include Lidar
    units that use lasers to image the car’s surroundings, RADAR to measure distances
    to objects surrounding the car, cameras to detect and recognize objects, and onboard
    computers and related cloud connectivity. These needs have attracted new competitors

    cities promoting electric vehicles to reduce urban pollution and move it upstream
    to electricity generation facilities. Tesla’s emergence stems from its early mover
    ability to replace internal combustion engines with an electric powertrain driven
    by batteries. One consequence of the rise of electric vehicles is a reduced demand
    for internal combustion engines, which threatens to obviate the significant global
    investments in internal combustion capacity by the major car companies. These
    stranded factory investments could in turn reduce the ability of major auto firms
    to fund internally the range of new technologies needed for AV development, motivating
    them to consider cooperation and co-innovation with the newly powerful entrants
    in the AV world.

    that some individuals might prefer to hire the services of a driverless car rather
    than own one. Boston Consulting Group estimated that in 2030, an AV with an electric
    powertrain could cost 75 percent more that of its internal combustion engine counterpart
    in 2017 and about 25 percent of all auto passenger miles in 2030 would come from

    use. Blockchains could manage the sharing economy demand for driverless car services

    on the chosen final configuration for each car. Such ownership stakes could be
    retained or traded, with ownership state changes recorded in the blockchain. APIs
    would allow individuals to summon a driverless car, and smart contracts would
    calculate and bill each user with proceeds shared among providers in relation
    to their ownership stake. Tokens native to that blockchain could be developed
    and serve as the means of payment for the transportation services offered. The
    tokens, representing revenue earned from driverless car usage by customers, would

    going to these individual owners; this third scenario seems less viable economically

    and in off-peak hours. Such a public utility model could use blockchains with

    autonomous vehicles offered for sharing use through a blockchain. This would be
    analogous to public ownership of bus or train transportation, with services offered
    to users with unique ID as municipal residents of a city or region. Such transportation
    as a utility service could be fee based, with a progressive fee structure possible,
    tied to income, while also offered as a free or reduced-price service for specifically
    identified segments of the population. The blockchain could use each traveler’s
    unique ID, together with travel route parameters, to calculate and bill that user
    for the transportation service rendered, similar to other utilities billed, such
    as public water provision. Such utility models could also be hybrid, with public/private
    partnerships, and with private owners receiving fees from use until fleet costs
    plus a predetermined return on investment are earned, at which point fleet ownership

    would need to initiate such cooperation. At the same time, a respected neutral
    firm from the IT sector, with blockchain expertise, would need to participate
    in these initial talks, as an “honest broker,” to add credibility and overcome
    reluctance to harness an unfamiliar technology. City public transit administrators
    would also need to participate to clarify rules and regulations governing AV introduction.

    would need to invest in developing and piloting new software modules, such as
    a solution that offers secure communication from IoT devices on each AV, to verify
    its digital identity, record usage, and link associated charges with specific
    transportation customers. Additional modules would match available AVs with customer
    demand, and allocate revenue earned, as well as associated AV costs to the appropriate
    AV supplier account. AV owners would need to be motivated to make their AV fleets
    available for use within the blockchain, with acceptable pricing formulas. To
    reduce risks for both AV customers and providers, the consortium would need to
    establish a market for tokens used within the system, obtain their listing on
    digital currency exchanges, and manage their value so that they function as stablecoins.
    These are not insurmountable challenges but indicate the tasks that must be addressed

    in communications between AVs and independent entities such as regulatory bodies,
    insurance firms, and in business and leisure applications. In AV design and manufacturing,
    traditional auto firms need to collaborate with electronics and software firms,
    at a minimum. At minimum, the blockchain-based production system should treat
    each AV as a token moving through the value chain, with individual firm contributions
    to AV value added updated in the ledger attached to the token, enabling tracking
    and rewarding of contributions.

    to each car registering state changes, such as usage of a specific vehicle by
    a specific clients. The blockchain can also register related data such as the
    AV’s present location and changes in location, linking such data to user billing.
    Furthermore, IoT sensors onboard each AV can monitor operational readiness. Such
    information could be linked to billing- and maintenance-related data including
    ordering parts and maintenance charges, resulting in an AV maintenance log over
    the AV’s entire useful life. Ownership-related data such as loans, leases, updated
    ownership equity, and depreciation charges could be similarly recorded. It is
    entirely possible for an AV to continue to be owned by the consortium of manufacturers,
    with usage charges billed in the blockchain accruing back to the AV owner over
    the AV’s useful life. Insurance companies could offer parametric insurance based
    on immutable, continually updated driving records and permissioned data access
    offered with differentiated access rights for owners, lenders, manufacturers,

    provide data privacy and secure content delivery as AV passengers interact with

    the number of AVs in operation increases, the blockchain application will need
    to manage many connections in a situation where real-time data provisioning is
    necessary for safe AV operation. On the manufacturing side, developing AV manufacturing
    across an ecosystem governed with a blockchain will require orchestrators akin
    to the role of Maersk and IBM in TradeLens, and an AV supplier side blockchain
    will face similar challenges of recruiting network members, establishing fair
    governance, and evaluating and rewarding contributions fairly. Such blockchains
    will also have to obtain regulatory approval when regulatory variation and multiple
    jurisdictions are likely to be the norm in early stages of AV introduction.

    chain to offer health care delivery in the United States. A critical element of
    providing quality care is continuous access to the latest patient information,
    with accuracy, availability, and timeliness, all paramount. However, the US health
    care system has had difficulty with this primary responsibility of providing up-to-date
    patient health care records to medical providers as and when needed. The reasons
    for the breakdown in fulfilling this basic and necessary service are manifold.
    Process variations impede the smooth transfer of health care records across organizational
    boundaries, which is further stymied by disparate standards and formats. Legal
    barriers stand in the way of such data handover, principally HIPAA provisions
    that motivate health care providers to err on the side of caution and delay such
    data transfer until complete assurance of compliance with HIPAA rules. The US
    health care system is fragmented, divided between governmental and private sector
    responsibilities; some segments of the private sector are for-profit entities
    and must balance profit maximization with health care provision, which affects
    these providers’ willingness to share health care records in a complete and timely
    fashion.
  prefs: []

    members. Health care records inform actuarial calculations that indicate insurability
    and the appropriate premium rate, setting health insurers and employers at possible
    odds with individual patients and their medical care providers. Similarly, individual
    genomic data can offer deep insights into susceptibility to disease incidence,
    but that would require legislative protection against invidious treatment to guard
    against individual consequences of health care record transparency across the
    ecosystem. Some of these impediments stem from ideological choices that underpin
    US health care provision. These impediments may not exist in countries that offer
    nationalized health care and single payer systems, where ecosystem members are
    more likely to share similar goals.

    centralized ecosystem, preferring a central, orchestrator role in a smaller ecosystem.
    Such an orchestrator would want to manage the network, set objectives, and control

    On the patient care side, there are several independent entities who are beginning
    to merge into integrated entities in response to cost reduction pressures and
    to better coordinate and thus improve patient outcomes. These entities include
    medical providers such as primary care physicians, nurses, and physician assistants,
    often organized into physician practice groups, community health centers, and
    newly emergent pharmacy-based clinics. They interact with specialist medical providers
    such as surgeons and oncologists, who all might be further grouped into hospitals,
    emergency rooms and intensive care units, rehabilitation facilities, assisted
    living, hospices, and other entities.

    of telemedicine providers and health care navigators, acting as intermediaries
    between the patient and patient care providers. Overseeing patient care are regulators,
    such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Health

    Administration. Private payers are numerous, with total health care payments apportioned
    between private health insurers and individuals making copayments on their covered
    health care costs; health insurance premiums from both individuals and employers
    that offer health insurance benefits offset, to an extent, insurance company outlays
    on covered costs. In addition, government and private sector foundation grants,
    together with corporate and venture capital funding, enable drug development and
    health care–related R&D, essential to the longer-term improvement of health care
    delivery. These funding sources distribute their outflows among pharmaceutical
    drug and generic drug manufacturers, medical equipment and device producers, medical
    supplies firms, health care information technology and software providers, and
    health care research organizations including universities. Other beneficiaries
    are health care intermediaries such as contract research organizations, insurance
    brokers, pharmacy benefit managers, drug distributors and pharmacies, and providers
    of legal services. Altogether, the US health care system accounts for nearly 20
    percent of US GDP.

    data silos. Integrating such disparate databases creates high switching costs
    and is likely to slow down potential blockchain disrupters, giving current EHR
    firms time to decide whether to offer their own blockchain-based electronic health
    records solutions. This results in incompatible processes and data standards across
