- en: Automating business processes is one of the most recurrent topics in industries,
    independent of its digital orientation. Competitiveness pushes companies to deliver
    their products or services efficiently and effectively. Besides providing the
    appropriate value, they are required to do it faster and with higher quality.
    This agile context leads to automate *everything* that can be automated to keep
    the focus on the value while optimizing the processing times, errors, and process
    performance, in general [[9](#CR9)].

    their use cases that typically leads to failed projects [[4](#CR4)]. On the one
    hand, when neither scaling nor a central government of robots is required, UI
    scripting tools could do the job at a fraction of the cost when compared to mature
    RPA solutions, which use to be disproportionate in simple contexts. On the other
    hand, the hype created around RPA pushes some companies to use the technology
    to the detriment of other more suitable solutions which would deliver more outstanding
    performance. For example, *utilizing* RPA to automate UIs even though the API
    is exploitable leads to unnecessary inefficiencies and high resource consumption.

  zh: 这种情况在公司在决定使用什么工具时创造了不确定性，这通常导致项目失败[[4](#CR4)]。一方面，当不需要扩展或机器人中央政府时，与成熟的RPA解决方案相比，UI脚本工具可以在更低的价格完成工作，这在简单环境中通常是比例失调的。另一方面，围绕RPA的炒作使一些公司使用这项技术，而牺牲其他更合适的解决方案，这些方案将提供更加出色的性能。例如，即使API是可利用的，仍使用RPA自动化UI会导致不必要的低效和高资源消耗。
- en: Even when the project (i.e., undesired contexts where no other automation alternative
    would work) fulfills the suitability criteria for RPA, companies may miss a threat
    analysis of the solution. In case that RPA is applied as a long-term solution
    (e.g., in legacy systems that cannot be changed), it becomes highly dependant
    on the UI of the base system. Therefore, monitoring or continuous testing is required
    to anticipate errors [[6](#CR6)]. In turn, if RPA is applied as a short-term solution
    (e.g., rapid solution without investing in a deep integration), its end-of-life
    should be defined and control. Otherwise, it will become a technical debt in the
    team that has to do the maintenance [[8](#CR8)].

- en: The future shape of the RPA technology is uncertain since mature RPA vendors
    provide some features that overlap with those traditionally existing in the BPM
    tools, e.g., process modeling, orchestration, and monitoring. Nonetheless, while
    the *RPA-centric* solutions focus on fine-grained tasks, *BPM-centric* solutions
    support rather more complex and sophisticated integrations. What is more, this
    uncertainty is increased by the different market movements in both (1) delivering

- en: What is clear is that both paradigms are part of a new *big thing* that enables
    the automation of a broader range of processes end-to-end. Independently on how
    they integrate, industry-grade solutions for RPA may support robot developers
    and robot operators/maintainers in a DevOps continuous cycle. In the development
    field, besides just creating and executing robots, additional features are necessary,
    like supporting identifying candidate processes to robotize, controlling the version
    of the robots, evolving them, or managing test suits in controlled environments.
    Regarding the operation field, besides the deployment of the robots in the execution
    environments, this role must be supported with, for example, scaling and descaling
    mechanisms, balancing the workload of the robot queues, or alerting rules to control
    the correct performance. These requirements become even more challenging when
    we consider the participation of the human in the process. This is highly relevant
    in the automation with RPA since the automated processes here are typically those
    which were previously on the human side. As the automation does not happen like
    a big bang but through iterations [[7](#CR7)], methods are required which consider
    the human in the process and that the work gradually shifts from the human side
    to the automatic/robotic side. Although robots have an initial relevant role in
    this shifting, the eventual automation solutions may use other more sound and
    resilient automation technology.

  zh: 明确的是，这两个范式都是新*大事*的一部分，它使端到端自动化更广泛的流程成为可能。无论它们如何集成，工业级RPA解决方案都可能支持机器人开发人员以及机器人操作员/维护人员在DevOps持续周期中。在开发领域，除了创建和执行机器人之外，还需要其他功能，比如支持识别候选机器人化流程、控制机器人版本、发展它们，或在受控环境中管理测试套件。关于运营领域，除了在执行环境中部署机器人，这个角色还必须支持，例如，扩展和缩减机制、平衡机器人队列的工作负载，或控制正确性能的警报规则。当考虑人类参与流程时，这些要求变得更加具有挑战性。在RPA的自动化中，这是非常相关的，因为这里自动化的流程通常是之前在人工侧的。由于自动化不是像大爆炸一样发生，而是通过迭代[[7](#CR7)]，因此需要考虑流程中的人类，并且工作逐渐从人工侧转移到自动/机器人侧。尽管机器人在这种转移的初始阶段扮演了重要的角色，但最终的自动化解决方案可能会使用其他更稳健和适应性强的自动化技术。

  zh: 摘要
- en: Robotic process automation is a technology to imitate human behavior when interacting
    with computers to perform digitized tasks manually, such as opening and closing
    applications, reading documents, entering data, and sending e-mails. As with any
    new technology, estimating the costs and break-even of robotic process automation
    projects is challenging. Currently, in practice, there are no dedicated guidelines
    for defining cost components in those projects that go beyond simple comparison
    with person-hours and salary cost. To address this gap, we review literature on
    the cost of robotic process automation projects to collect and structure those
    cost drivers that can be generalized. We categorize and prioritize them and derive
    a novel cost framework specifically for the cost estimation of robotic process
    automation projects. The framework comprises three cost calculation perspectives
    for three distinct project scopes hosting eleven cost drivers in the three categories
    development, investment, and operation. We illustrate the framework in a robotic
    process automation use case to demonstrate its usefulness.

    understanding “what RPA can do” and “what RPA cannot do” in its current form nearing
    the plateau of productivity.

  zh: 机器人流程自动化（RPA）最近在Gartner针对法律和合规技术的炒作周期中，已从过度期望的顶峰跌落到幻灭的谷底 [[1](#CR1)]。这表明商业界对“RPA能做什么”和“RPA当前形式下不能做什么”有了更好的理解，正接近生产力的平台期。
- en: Nevertheless, according to Syed et al. [[2](#CR2)] measuring RPA cost and benefit
    realization still poses a challenge as there is no readily available metric system
    or even a common understanding of the benefits and cost of RPA. This is chiefly
    because RPA is a novel approach to IT automation and not directly comparable to
    traditional IT-related projects, developing a novel IT system, or implementing
    workflows using standalone business process management (BPM) software to automate
    a task rather than automate the human worker [[3](#CR3)].
  id: totrans-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然而，根据Syed等人的研究 [[2](#CR2)]，测量RPA的成本和效益实现仍然是一个挑战，因为目前还没有现成的度量系统，甚至对RPA的益处和成本没有一个普遍的理解。这主要是因为RPA是一种新颖的IT自动化方法，与传统的IT项目、开发一种新的IT系统，或者使用独立的业务流程管理（BPM）软件实施工作流程以自动化任务而不是自动化人力
    [[3](#CR3)] 有很大不同。
- en: In contrast, due to their simple structure, it is tempting to break down RPA
    projects into “wins” or “fails” at first glance. However, in reality, it is not
    nearly as trivial to understand the cost-benefit relation at work as not all cost
    drivers are apparent at all times. Hence, a reasonable first step to approach
    RPA project measurement is to focus on the cost incurred by the development, investment,
    and operation of RPA as – in contrast to benefits – costs can be better quantified
    and assessed early in projects [[4](#CR4)].

  zh: 相比之下，由于其结构简单，初看上去很有诱惑地将RPA项目分解为“成功”或“失败”。然而，实际上，要理解工作中的成本效益关系远非易事，因为并非所有的成本驱动因素在任何时候都显而易见。因此，在RPA项目测量方面迈出的合理第一步，就是关注RPA开发、投资和运营过程中所发生的成本——与效益不同，成本可以更早地在项目中进行量化和评估
    [[4](#CR4)]。
- en: While it may sound promising now to compile a comprehensive framework of RPA
    cost drivers, any approach for RPA has to align with the lightweight character

  zh: 2.1 IT自动化项目与RPA项目成本比较
- en: Traditional IT automation projects implementing enterprise software or BPM software
    are considered to be heavyweight implementation projects, as they require long-term
    and intensive design and testing within the already existing IT infrastructure
    [[2](#CR2), [6](#CR6)]. Similarly, these automation projects require application
    programming interfaces (API) to existing software to automate tasks across different
    applications. These APIs are not always available or sufficient and sometimes
    must be implemented first, before any automation can be approached [[7](#CR7)].
    In contrast, RPA represents a lightweight automation approach as it only focuses
    on the pre-existing presentation layers of (enterprise) software enabling rapid
    development and rollout [[3](#CR3)]. Compared to traditional automation projects,
    RPA aims to imitate human behavior rather than automate tasks within the IT backend.
    This anthropomorphic characteristic allows business users, without extensive programming
    knowledge, to develop RPA robots on their own that mimic themselves [[8](#CR8)].

  zh: 实现企业软件或BPM软件的传统IT自动化项目被认为是一项重型实施项目，因为它们需要在现有的IT架构中进行长期和密集的设计和测试[[2](#CR2), [6](#CR6)]。同样，这些自动化项目需要现有的软件的应用程序编程接口（API）来实现跨不同应用程序的自动化任务。这些API并不总是可用或足够，有时必须在任何自动化尝试之前实现[[7](#CR7)]。相比之下，RPA代表了一种轻量级的自动化方法，因为它只关注（企业）软件的预先存在的表现层，从而实现快速开发和部署[[3](#CR3)]。与传统自动化项目相比，RPA旨在模仿人类行为，而不是在IT后端自动化任务。这种拟人化特征使得业务用户（无需深入了解编程知识）可以自行开发模仿自己的RPA机器人[[8](#CR8)]。
- en: Hence, it is evident that these characteristics also impact the resulting costs
    of implementations [[2](#CR2)]. While automation projects for enterprise software
    mainly produce high costs due to their lengthy and labor-intensive customization
    [[9](#CR9)], RPA is often considered as a bridging technology that enables rapid
    automation until backend integration is financially and organizationally feasible
    [[3](#CR3)]. Thus, in traditional automation projects, costs usually arise before
    and during project implementation [[2](#CR2), [6](#CR6)]. In contrast, in RPA
    software robots that only access the presentation layer of legacy software are
    prone to errors as adjustments to the user interface (UI) can cause the software
    robot to become inoperable [[7](#CR7)]. This results in long-term costs for operating
    and maintaining RPA robots [[10](#CR10)]. Consequently, the nature and timing
    of how cost drivers occur may vary compared to traditional automation projects.
  id: totrans-38
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 因此，很明显，这些特征也会影响实施的结果成本[[2](#CR2)]。由于企业软件的自动化项目主要因其漫长的和劳动密集型的定制而产生高成本[[9](#CR9)]，RPA通常被视为一种桥梁技术，它使快速自动化成为可能，直到后台集成在财务和组织上可行[[3](#CR3)]。因此，在传统的自动化项目中，成本通常出现在项目实施前和实施期间[[2](#CR2),
    [6](#CR6)]。相比之下，在RPA软件中，只访问遗留软件的表现层的软件机器人容易出错，因为用户界面（UI）的调整可能导致软件机器人无法操作[[7](#CR7)]。这导致维护和运行RPA机器人的长期成本[[10](#CR10)]。因此，与传统自动化项目相比，成本驱动因素的发生性质和时机可能会有所不同。
- en: However, while various cost drivers that occur during and after a traditional
    automation project are well researched [[6](#CR6)], the lack of holistic and scientific
    studies focusing on cost drivers within RPA projects becomes apparent [[2](#CR2)].
    To measure RPA costs more accurately and appropriately, they need to be systematized
    in a structured fashion.

    and costs of such implementations in the long and short term. While calculating
    benefits can be challenging as they can arise as both quantitative and qualitative
    factors, calculating costs usually relies on quantitative drivers [[11](#CR11)].
    In practice, the success evaluation is done by applying several key performance
    indicators focusing on different aspects and time periods [[11](#CR11)–[13](#CR13)].

  zh: 为了衡量一个IT自动化项目的成功程度，公司必须比较这类实施长期和短期的收益和成本。尽管计算收益可能具有挑战性，因为它们可以作为定量和定性因素出现，但计算成本通常依赖于定量驱动因素[[11](#CR11)]。在实践中，通过应用几个关键绩效指标来评估成功，这些指标关注不同的方面和时间段[[11](#CR11)–[13](#CR13)]。
- en: Theory and practice distinguish these key performance indicators in *absolute*
    and *relative metrics* to differentiate between the overall success and the effectiveness
    of a project [[11](#CR11), [14](#CR14)–[19](#CR19)]. The effectiveness is measured
    with the return on investment (ROI) [[16](#CR16)–[18](#CR18), [20](#CR20), [21](#CR21)].
    These two metrics are supplemented with the metric *time to ROI* to enable alignment
    with a company’s strategic plans. Time to ROI is the time required for benefits
    to equal costs [[18](#CR18), [21](#CR21)]. Consequently, measuring success in
    various RPA implementation projects requires taking these key performance indicators
    into account.

- en: 'Procedure of Structured Literature Review.To ensure scientific rigor, we conducted
    a structured literature review according to vom Brocke et al. [[22](#CR22)]. Since
    RPA is intersecting many research fields, we queried multiple databases. We focused
    on the computer science related databases ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.
    Further, we queried the information systems related databases Science Direct and
    AIS eLibrary. Lastly, we included the database SpringerLink, for contributions
    from multidisciplinary research fields. Thereby, we use following search query:
    *“RPA OR ‘robotic process automation’”*. In doing so, we intentionally kept the
    search query generic to avoid excluding articles that indirectly discuss various
    cost drivers of RPA. Further, due to the novelty of the subject, we did not restrict
    our research results to any form of outlet rankings. Following this strategy,
    we found 1,522 academic contributions dealing with the topic of RPA. Through abstract,
    title, and keyword analysis, followed by full-text analysis, as well as forward
    and backward search of the remaining contributions, we found only *n* = 8 academic
    contributions that were relevant to our cause. We have classified contributions
    as relevant that describe and discuss the cost drivers in detail, rather than
    just naming them. Figure [1](#Fig1) provides an overview of the process.![../images/509088_1_En_2_Chapter/509088_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/509088_1_En_2_Chapter/509088_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png)'

    of RPA implementations is significantly lower than traditional IT development
    projects ranging from small-scale custom development to enterprise software introduction
    although all require special knowledge for their development [[38](#CR38)]. Typical
    development costs are planning & design, consultancy, training, RPA development,

    licensing costs, RPA vendors often provide trial licenses or community editions
    with a limited feature set [[30](#CR30)]. Similarly, due to the low-code nature
    of RPA, there may not be a need for dedicated programmers or external consultants.
    As a result, business users can develop initial RPA robots themselves and thus
    only generate implementation costs without the need for external cost or additional

    performed more accurately, as poor decision-making may negatively impact the operation
    of multiple software robots [[30](#CR30)]. Further, similar to the cost of deploying

    when an RPA automation project can add value to companies. While IT creates value
    through many different aspects such as competitive advantage or increasing operational
    effectiveness [[41](#CR41)] our research focuses on the investigation of monetary
    aspects namely cost drivers. Even though the results of the academic literature
    review were limited, our survey of cost drivers is the first comprehensive analysis
    of this emerging topic. Our consideration of practice reports does not only enrich
    and justify our findings, but it extends it with current observations from the
    field that we scrutinized theoretically. While our dimensions to structure cost
    drivers for RPA projects are not unique to RPA, and none of the concepts is necessarily
    unheard of, their combination provides a novel systematization of costs in RPA
    projects that can be readily applied in multiple projects scopes with multiple
    perspectives on cost estimation. Therefore, it provides a novel lens through which
    one can consider cost estimation in RPA projects. It enables straightforward measurements
    with minimal overhead that are of immediate practical value as well as comprehensive
    considerations of the extended costs of widespread and institutionalized automation
    with RPA. Our framework is extensible. That is, the emergence of novel cost drivers
    due to the evolution from symbolic RPA to intelligent RPA [[40](#CR40)] can be
    incorporated naturally. It is grounded in theory but designed for practical application.

    be useful for practice and extends beyond the simplistic calculation of *“salary
    times working hours”* prevalent in contemporary RPA projects. With the 3 × 3 costing
    matrix, cost estimation can be contextualized to fit a range of project scopes.
    It is simple enough to be of immediate pragmatic use to structure costing in early
    RPA projects, but it is also a comprehensive guideline to consult when embarking
    or continuing one’s automation journey with RPA. That is, a company’s cost estimation
    using the framework can grow as the projects grow from the first software robot
    to the institutionalized use of this technology. However, these cost drivers will
    change as companies begin to incorporate other automation technologies such as
    self-learning robots [[40](#CR40)] that can maintain themselves.

- en: While the cost drivers presented in Table [1](#Tab1) are derived from RPA-based
    literature, we found similarities to cost drivers from traditional automation
    projects. In this context, cost drivers such as consulting, planning & design
    or testing are also relevant in these types of projects [[2](#CR2), [6](#CR6)].
    However, the occurrence time differs, since many stages in traditional projects
    are performed before the rollout, compared to the rapid development and continuous
    maintaining behavior of RPA projects [[3](#CR3)]. Also, when comparing RPA implementations
    with automation techniques that use artificial intelligence (AI), e.g., cognitive
    automation, many similarities and differences become apparent. For example, while
    AI-based systems must deal with drifts in the data, resulting in continuous adjustments
    [[40](#CR40)], RPA robots have to be maintained when the presentation layer of
    software is changed. Further, cost driver such as consultancy, planning & design,
    testing, training, or hardware & infrastructure, also apply to these automation
    projects [[42](#CR42)] However similar to traditional implementation projects,
    most of these cost drivers are primarily incurred before the actual rollout, as
    AI-based systems require a lot of data collection and heavyweight training, especially
    when it comes to neural networks [[43](#CR43)].

    [6](#CR6)]。然而，这些成本的发生时间不同，因为与RPA项目相比，许多传统项目在部署之前就已经完成了许多阶段[[3](#CR3)]。此外，当将RPA实施与使用人工智能（AI）的自动化技术进行比较，例如认知自动化时，许多相似之处和差异变得明显。例如，虽然基于AI的系统必须处理数据漂移，导致持续调整[[40](#CR40)]，但RPA机器人当软件的表现层发生变化时必须进行维护。此外，咨询、规划与设计、测试、培训或硬件与基础设施等成本驱动因素也适用于这些自动化项目[[42](#CR42)]。然而与传统的实施项目类似，大多数这些成本驱动因素主要在实际部署之前产生，因为基于AI的系统需要收集大量数据并进行重型训练，尤其是涉及到神经网络时[[43](#CR43)]。

    for just any type of automation project and, thus, we may have missed a suitable
    metric. Thus, we were not able to quantify the change in costs for the various
    drivers when scaling up the project scopes. In addition, we stayed on the level
    of cost drivers and did not analyze individual cost factors and aggregated them
    to concrete formulae. Lastly, we used the scenario technique and theoretical arguments
    to assess our cost framework and did not perform naturalistic evaluation workshops

    cost drivers for RPA has not been undertaken and constitutes a research gap and
    practical problem for many companies. In response, we categorized and prioritized
    cost drivers for RPA projects and derived a novel cost framework specifically
    for the cost estimation in such projects. We illustrated the framework’s usefulness
    and discussed the framework’s implication for theory and practice. Our implication
    entails that the framework provides a novel lens to analyze costs in RPA projects
    and assists practice in objectively budgeting and reviewing costs in RPA projects.
    To counter our limitations, future research will need to review and adapt cost
    formulae to suit RPA, apply the framework to real-life cases, and revisit costing
    in other automation domains to assess the transferability of results.

    monotonous work, providing space for creative and innovative tasks. RPA tools
    provide a wide range of techniques to automate user interactions, including filling
    forms and copying values between applications. While it is accepted that decisions
    play an important role in business processes, they are not a first-class citizen
    in RPA. This paper proposes a framework and a software architecture that integrates
    decision management into RPA. The work is evaluated by a prototype that introduces
    Decision Model and Notation (DMN) capabilities to the RPA software tool UiPath
    by utilizing Camunda’s decision engine.

- en: Over the last few years, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) gained momentum in
    research, fueled by its adoption in industry [[1](#CR1)]. With the promise of
    taking digital, repetitive work off the hands of employees, companies are increasingly
    using RPA to improve the efficiency of their processes while freeing up human
    labor for more creative and innovative tasks [[3](#CR3), [23](#CR23)]. Using software
    robots, RPA tools imitate the behavior of human users, such as mouse and keyboard
    inputs, but are also able to, for example, query web services and control applications [[14](#CR14),
    [23](#CR23)]. As artificial intelligence techniques have improved, the scope of
    RPA applications has continued to expand. Nowadays, RPA can not only imitate interactions
    but also gains more and more human capabilities, such as text recognition and
    learning from past executions [[7](#CR7), [14](#CR14), [19](#CR19)].

    or *switch* constructs to steer the process. Thus, processes with complex decision
    logic are either very cumbersome to implement or the potential RPA process may
    even be discarded for automation, which motivates the need for better decision
    management in RPA.

    such that decision-intensive processes led to complex process models with many
    nested branches [[4](#CR4), [24](#CR24)]. In traditional business process management,
    the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard [[21](#CR21)] was introduced to
    resolve the problem by separating the decision logic from the process flow [[4](#CR4)].
    In this work, we examine whether and how elements of DMN, as a proven modeling
    standard for decisions, could be integrated into RPA. For this purpose, we analyze
    the RPA lifecycle and transfer elements from DMN to RPA to benefit from its powerful
    but still visual representation of decision logic.

    and a generic software architecture is described. In Sect. [5](#Sec12), a prototype
    is presented that demonstrates the integration of DMN in the RPA vendor UiPath,
    enabling new use cases that were previously difficult to realize. Additionally,
    limitations of the approach are discussed. Section [6](#Sec15) summarizes the
    contribution and provides hints for future research.

    representing the decision logic, they are not only difficult to maintain, e.g.,
    when a particular aspect in the decision logic changes, but their complexity also
    impedes communication using the model [[4](#CR4)].

    was introduced. It allows to separate the decision logic from the control flow
    logic in process models represented in BPMN [[20](#CR20), [21](#CR21)]. DMN enables
    the automated evaluation of decisions and can therefore be used in automated business
    processes. Nevertheless, the standard also focuses on comprehensibility for non-technical

    The central element is the *Decision Table*, which specifies the rules on how
    to derive the correct decision result from given input values. More specifically,
    a decision table consists of (i) a set of input parameters required for making
    the decision, (ii) a set of output variables whose values have to be determined
    based on the input parameters, as well as (iii) a list of rules that match values
    or value-ranges of the input parameters and assign the appropriate values to the
    output variables. So-called hit policies are used to specify how these rules are
    evaluated, e.g., whether only the first matching rule should be applied or the
    outputs of all matching rules should be returned.

    processes, the comparably new technology of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) concentrates
    on local workflows mainly on a single workstation [[11](#CR11)]. The main goal
    of RPA is to automate frequent and rule-based workflows performed by a user on
    a computer [[3](#CR3), [15](#CR15), [23](#CR23)], such as transferring data between
    different systems, like from an e-mail to a customer-relationship-management program.
    On the one hand, this is intended to relieve the user of such repetitive, monotonous
    tasks; on the other hand, it is expected to reduce the error rate and thus increase
    the overall quality [[23](#CR23)]. To perform such automation, so-called RPA bots
    are utilized, small software clients that imitate the behavior of the user, e.g.,
    by simulating mouse and keyboard interactions or more advanced operations [[3](#CR3),
    [23](#CR23)].

    modeling decisions in selected, leading RPA tools, that are supported natively,
    i.e., are offered as building blocks for bots by default. All investigated providers
    offer basic *if/else* nodes with two outgoing control flow branches. Also, most
    of them provide the possibility to prompt the user a dialog with an input field
    or selection, which could be used to defer decisions to a human worker. More advanced
    constructs, such as *if/elseif* or *case* statements, i.e., elements with more
    than two outputs, are already less common and implemented with varying complexity.Table

    decisions lead to bloated models that are hard to understand and maintain [[22](#CR22)],
    which is a problem because RPA is supposed to take over rule-based processes and
    be easy to use. Of course, similarly to script activities in BPMN, many RPA vendors
    offer blocks for executing custom code in which decision logic could be realized.
    While this might be feasible for certain use cases, in general, it contradicts
    the philosophy of RPA to be accessible even without programming knowledge. In
    addition, the decision logic itself is hidden from business users, who thus cannot
    gain a holistic view of the robot’s function.

    of decision-making in RPA models. Suppose a company frequently sends out advertising
    material in various forms, such as simple postcards, letters, and parcels. Depending
    on the form and scope of the campaign, different shipping costs accrue, and different
    departments of the company must be involved. For example, postcards for a national
    campaign can be directly issued by the applicant for 50 ct per piece, international
    postcards and domestic letters have to be commissioned via the sales department,
    and international letters, as well as any parcels, must be arranged with the logistics.

    to determine the price and the department has to be modeled using the above-described

    of the model as shown in Fig. [2](#Fig2) (blue-framed box). Once created, the
    bot is of course functional, however, its maintenance is difficult. For example,
    as soon as the production and shipment costs for the material change, the RPA
    bot needs to be updated, but the nested structure hampers quick adjustments, not
    to mention more fundamental changes in the decision logic. Consequently, it is
    very time-consuming to create and maintain the RPA bot, and it is very likely
    that the use case is soon discarded for automation with established RPA solutions.

    sent postcards of any weight cost 80 ct per piece and must be ordered by the sales
    department. If now the RPA bot could make the decision using the decision table

    for automation with RPA, different frameworks were proposed. In general, RPA is
    found especially useful for less complex processes to allow for short implementation
    times [[23](#CR23)]. In terms of decision complexity, the integration of DMN can
    increase the number of suitable processes, since decisions that previously had
    to be laboriously modeled using control flow elements can then be created independently
    using DMN. Of course, not all decisions are suitable for automation with RPA and
    DMN. DMN is mainly suitable for modeling and making operational decisions that
    are well-defined, frequently executed, and rather have a local and short impact [[6](#CR6)].
    However, these requirements fit well with the characteristics of RPA processes,
    such as a high volume and degree of standardization, and the “digitized structured
    data input” [[23](#CR23)], important for an automated evaluation of decisions.

    a visual RPA process model that defines the RPA agent’s relevant activities, structure,

    from the control flow. This separation is therefore particularly apparent and
    significant in the design phase. The logic for decision-making, previously defined
    using the available bot building blocks such as if/else, should now be extracted
    into a single RPA activity dedicated to decision-making by evaluating a corresponding
    decision table.

- en: In general, RPA bots are created in an RPA vendor-specific model notation that
    provides the activities available for automation and allows selecting and arranging
    them in a process-like sequence. But, as mentioned before, there is no standardized
    modeling language for RPA. Instead, each provider of RPA tools maintains its specific
    solution of a graphical or textual notation to represent the model. However, it
    is recommended to prefer intuitive visual modeling tools, as they do not require
    specific IT development skills and thus make the creation of RPA process models
    accessible to domain experts [[12](#CR12)]. For the integration of DMN in RPA,
    graphical models are primarily suitable since DMN allows decisions to be represented
    by graphical elements and aims at being accessible to non-IT users as well [[21](#CR21)].
  id: totrans-176

- en: For creating RPA models in the respective model notation, several ways are conceivable.
    Recent approaches suggest mining or learning RPA bots from past executions (i.e., [[2](#CR2),
    [13](#CR13)]). However, these approaches are currently at the beginning of their
    development and are rarely adopted in industry tools. Hence, they will not be
    considered further here.

- en: Consequently, the traditional manual modeling of RPA bots is still the predominant
    way. It involves human workers, domain experts, as well as technical experts [[23](#CR23)].
    The integration of DMN benefits from this setting, as all stakeholders can participate
    in the modeling process, and thus all decision-relevant factors can be considered
    due to the broad circle of participants. Decision activities can easily be added
    to the RPA process by hand just as any other type of activity is added to the
    process.

- en: Besides the manual modeling, most RPA tools offer a recording mode that tracks
    all interactions that a user performs on a computer system [[18](#CR18)], which
    is a quick way to capture an RPA process [[12](#CR12)]. This method, called screen
    recording, uses the observed user interactions to create a model that the RPA
    bot can then repeat exactly. However, screen recordings can only capture one execution
    path, i.e., a case-specific, linear workflow performed by a human user that does
    not include any choices regarding control flow or data. Therefore, this model
    creation method is suitable for repetitive processes without variation but not
    for processes with extensive decisions.

    way to obtain an RPA process model with decision points. To enable better decision
    management for the screen recording approach as well, the recording functionalities
    would need to be adapted to support alternative execution branches.

    as already mentioned, the integration of DMN into RPA aims at separating the decision
    logic from the control flow. Here, the separation facilitates the communication
    regarding the decision logic, since it is not covered in the RPA bot model but
    explicitly represented using the DMN standard, enabling the collaboration of both
    business users and IT experts.

    manually. However, there are also approaches for mining decision logic from event
    logs [[4](#CR4), [8](#CR8)]. While this could result in beneficial synergies with
    the previously mentioned mining methods of RPA models, it is still a complex challenge
    to extract both the process and decisions together from an event log [[10](#CR10)]

    conceivable, either a local embedding of a decision engine within the RPA tool
    or the connection to an external decision service. When the decision engine is
    directly embedded in the RPA software, no further, external dependencies are needed
    and decisions are created and evaluated locally. However, it requires the vendor
    to implement DMN functionalities that might already be present in potentially
    used BPMS systems.
  id: totrans-195
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, another approach is to outsource the modeling and evaluation of decisions
    to an external decision service. Such decision services usually already provide
    a modeling tool for defining decisions and a network interface through which third-party
    software can request their evaluation. To enable the processing of decision tables
    in RPA, the bot must only be able to connect to this interface to provide the
    required input values and obtain the decision’s outputs. As the decisions are
    not defined within the RPA tool anymore, unlike the local embedding, this external
    approach facilitates sharing the same decision logic between RPA bots or even
    business processes of the company.

    indicators can now be derived, such as the distributions of decision outcomes,
    e.g., what share international letters account for in the example, which can be
    used to further improve the process in the subsequent passes of the lifecycle.

    is given. First, at design-time, the decision logic is defined using the *decision
    modeler* of the external decision service and subsequently saved in its *decision
    model repository*. Now, whenever a new *RPA bot* is created in the RPA software,
    a DMN decision point can be added to the bot’s workflow, provided that such a
    DMN activity is available in the RPA tool. This DMN activity is then linked to
    a decision model stored in the decision model repository. Additionally, it requires
    configuration of variables that should be passed from the bot to the decision
    service for evaluation, i.e., values available in the bot need to be mapped to
    input values required by the decision.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At run-time, the two components communicate as shown in Fig. [5](#Fig5). As
    soon as a bot, started and operated by the *RPA controller*, reaches a decision
    point, it requests the *decision engine* of the external decision service using
    the linked decision identifier and provides the required decision variables as
    input as configured at design-time. The decision engine then requests the decision
    table from the decision model repository using the identifier and subsequently
    calculates the decision result based on the input data and the decision table.
    The output of the decision (*decisionResult*) is then returned to the bot so that
    the RPA process can continue accordingly and use the decision result.![../images/509088_1_En_3_Chapter/509088_1_En_3_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/509088_1_En_3_Chapter/509088_1_En_3_Fig5_HTML.png)

    decreases as the decision logic does not have to be realized using control flow
    elements but is encapsulated in a decision task. This not only facilitates the
    modeling process itself, but also ensures better maintainability later, as the
    control flow logic and decision logic can be updated independently. In addition,
    especially if BPMN and DMN are already in use, it allows reusing decision logic
    in other bots or business processes, thus having a central place for decision
    logic. Overall, it may further increase the adoption of RPA, as the barriers for
    automating workflows with complex, data-based decision logic are lowered.
  id: totrans-227

    the use of already existing approaches for mining decision logic from data could
    be evaluated further in the future. This would coincide with the recent endeavors
    to mine RPA bots from logs. Furthermore, we concentrated on decision tables in
    this work, but DMN provides more advanced concepts for decision management, such
    as decision requirements graphs, that could be considered in the future. Other
    interesting points for future research are checks for correctness or soundness
    of RPA bots in conjunction with DMN activities, as it has been done for BPMN and
    DMN. This is especially important since RPA bots are usually not tested in a separate
    environment, but are directly deployed to the live systems.

- en: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has quickly evolved from automating simple
    rule-based tasks. Nowadays, RPA is required to mimic more sophisticated human
    tasks, thus implying its combination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology,
    i.e., the so-called intelligent RPA. Putting together RPA with AI leads to a challenging
    scenario since (1) it involves professionals from both fields who typically have
    different skills and backgrounds, and (2) AI models tend to degrade over time
    which affects the performance of the overall solution. This paper describes the
    AIRPA project, which addresses these challenges by proposing a software architecture
    that enables (1) the abstraction of the robot development from the AI development
    and (2) the monitor, control, and maintain intelligent RPA developments to ensure
    its quality and performance over time. The project has been conducted in the Servinform
    context, a Spanish consultancy firm, and the proposed prototype has been validated
    with reality settings. The initial experiences yield promising results in reducing
    AHT (Average Handle Time) in processes where AIRPA deployed cognitive robots,
    which encourages exploring the support of intelligent RPA development.

    intelligent RPA solutions – are receiving increasing attention, as the combination
    of both disciplines offers and several advantages [[2](#CR2)]. On the one hand,
    AI methods enhance RPA solutions by providing new capabilities that enable a more
    significant number of end-to-end processes to be automated. On the other hand,
    RPA solutions produce data on the execution of the process themselves, allowing
    periodic training of the AI models, leading to continuous improvement of the model
    metrics [[9](#CR9)].

    data to extract relevant information from it) is required to develop the cognitive
    components and, without an abstraction role, needs to know the business process
    to configure a model for each business case. This fact leads to a strong dependency
    between the data scientist and the RPA developer role (i.e., professional in charge
    of designing and developing software robots) who must know the business process
    to automate it^([1](#Fn1)). Secondly, the performance of these components in a
    production environment depends on the data model performance, which tends to degrade
    over time [[6](#CR6)]. Degradation refers to multiple reasons, such as: (1) the
    evolution of the business over time and the AI obsolescence in the new business
    context, (2) the AI technology advance caused by the new scientist research in
    the AI, that can improve the AI performance and accuracy, led previous AI models
    obsolete, and (3) the need to re-training models to increase their accuracy and
    performance for a specific task. This problem arises the need to conduct the AIRPA
    project, a platform with an architecture that allows solving the challenges encountered,
    (1) separate the work of RPA developer and data scientist to abstract robot construction
    from model development, and (2) control, monitor, and support the robots to ensure
    quality maintenance of the intelligent RPA components.'

    that automates the process. However, such developers may lack skills related to
    AI. For this, AI services (e.g., text-to-image, speech-to-text recognition, sentiment
    analysis, image anomaly detection, and others) have to be black boxes that always
    maintain an acceptable level of accuracy in their responses. The data scientist’s
    implementation of these cognitive solutions makes their use transparent to the
    RPA developer. To these needs, the AIRPA project provides an architecture that
    supports the abstraction between both roles, and continuous monitoring mechanisms
    to ensure the quality of AI models, for both new release deployments and retraining.![../images/509088_1_En_4_Chapter/509088_1_En_4_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/509088_1_En_4_Chapter/509088_1_En_4_Fig1_HTML.png)

    that previously required human intervention, i.e., aiming towards end-to-end process
    automation. For instance, the prediction of electricity consumption, considering
    that electricity use changes over time and consumption forecasts are of great
    value to utilities. For this purpose, a component is needed that determines what
    the consumption will be on the next bill, based on a customer’s data history.
    Another example is related to document classification since companies typically
    use different formats when they issue documents. In this way, a component is required
    for classifying invoices or sales orders from different organizations with similar
    information but a different structure or style.

    the AI components degradation and the reduction of ML model performance has been
    found. That is, this paper will focus its proposed architecture on the fact that
    the “*maintenance of a machine learning model involves regular updating to ensure
    that predictive effectiveness is not lost over time”* [[6](#CR6)]. Therefore,

    the intelligent RPA process management. This module resembles a customized state
    machine for each process, indicating which state a robot is in at any given moment
    and recording evidence of its transitions. The essential tasks of this module
    are (1) the collection of data needed for evidence capture and (2) the management
    and automated reporting of robots and tasks in which human intervention is required.
    The latter provides a differential value in intelligent RPA processes, thanks
    to labeling the data collected in daily work. In other words, the management of
    hybrid human-robot tasks allows the capture of data from the decisions which are
    made by humans, an essential task for the training of cognitive component models
    that will fully automate these tasks in the future. The collection of this data,
    together with the information reported by the cognitive components, feeds the
    *tracking and exploitation panel* for process reporting and obtaining valuable
    information of each process during its execution. It monitors, among other things,
    the performance of the models, facilitating their maintenance.

    of an AI component by the RPA developer. For this purpose, *AIRPA components*
    are built, i.e., AI services with a microservices-based architecture that standardizes
    their service contract through a REST API. These components are designed as *wrappers*
    that allow the incorporation of ML models using the files previously exported
    in the data scientist’s work environment. In this way, the RPA developer should
    only focus on consuming the methods offered by this API. Thus, any changes to
    the model will not affect its integration with the RPA solution.
  id: totrans-273

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, AI components designed as *wrappers* solve further problems. Generally,
    AI components in the context of intelligent RPA are implemented by commercial
    solutions (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google, or Microsoft). These solutions pose
    several problems since a series of compatibility restrictions limit their use.
    They are not versatile enough to re-train the models from business data, and their
    customization becomes a rather complicated task. The *wrappers* component design
    allows the incorporation of proprietary Machine Learning (ML) models, solving
    these issues. This fact provides an added value since, although their use is not
    widespread in the context of RPA, open-source solutions are leading the main developments
    in the field of AI [[12](#CR12)]. This design increases the specialization capacity
    of each model and reduces the cost of access caused by licensing limitations to
    AI components. Therefore, the *AIRPA components* of the AIRPA project, a library
    representing the first initial objective of the project, enable ML solutions such
    as classifications, anomaly detection, intelligent document processing, audio
    transcription, or sentiment analysis, among others.

    framework and the *MySQL* database. This module has two databases, the *CR Online*
    for the management of all information necessary to use *Control Room* (e.g., users,

    a unique site that permits login to the whole system. Finally, the creation of
    *wrappers* for the *AIRPA Components* is a custom design implemented in *Python*
    language with *Django REST Framework*. In its construction, several specific libraries
    from the field of data processing and ML are used to facilitate feature engineering
    and the incorporation of ML models from *Scikit Learn*, *TensorFlow*, and *PyTorch*

    monitor and detect cognitive degradation. However, they are not unified to be
    used in RPA. It should be noted that they offer RPA integration but deploying
    and monitoring AI components is in an isolation system separated from the monitoring
    of RPA.
  id: totrans-295

    Prism^([9](#Fn9)) allows the use of cognitive components deployed in Google Cloud,
    where they are monitored. Nonetheless, it forces the use of both (1) the Google
    platform to monitor cognitive components and (2) the Blue Prism platform to monitoring
    the non-cognitive ones. Similarly, UIPath^([10](#Fn10)) platform offers a service
    called *AI Center*. The service allows deploying cognitive components and monitoring
    them but, unlike the AIRPA platform, it does not detect the degradation of components.
    Moreover, *AI Center* is a proprietary solution and only accessible for use in
    the UIPath technology stack (i.e., UIPath Studio, AI Center, and Orchestrator).
    In other words, the existing RPA platforms do not support the detection of model
    degradation in AI components. So it is necessary to navigate to AI service platforms
    providers to consult this information. Moreover, since AI services are not integrated
    with RPA platforms, it is necessary to manage logins, tokens, etc. between the
    two platforms. Furthermore, AIRPA differentiates itself from other platforms by
    the use of AI components as *wrappers*. With these, APIs through AI components
    are offered, they follow the same specification and, therefore, RPA developers
    only need to know this specification to implement the AI-RPA integration (Table [1](#Tab1)).

    that study the RPA and the AI field [[4](#CR4), [13](#CR13)]. Some of them use
    AI not to build components, but for early stages in the RPA lifecycle, in the
    process discovery phases [[3](#CR3), [7](#CR7), [10](#CR10), [11](#CR11)]. Nevertheless,
    others deal with the application of AI on RPA processes, such as [[1](#CR1)],
    which studies key open research challenges that exist in the combination of RPA
    with AI, or [[9](#CR9)], which proposes a dynamic taxonomy for intelligent RPA
    components. There are other proposals to improve the RPA architecture. For example,
    [[8](#CR8)] elaborates on optimizing the deployment architecture of the RPA components.
    Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there are no proposals that focus
    on the operation and maintenance phase of the robots, such as AIRPA. At a glance,
    unlike existing proposals, AIRPA proposes a system to manage and intensively monitor
    cognitive components, separating the AI development from the RPA developer. All
    these are carried out easily and integrally in one platform.

    results may vary after it. The platform has been validated in several real scenarios
    that require the incorporation of cognitive actions. In this way, the aim is to
    evaluate the AIRPA operation applied to different business areas, such as energy
    or telecommunications. One of these validation has been carried out specifically
    on the consumption prediction use case shown in Sect. [2](#Sec2). In this case,
    the generation of automatic predictions from historical data, without the need
    for human interaction, represents a considerable improvement. It is performed
    within Servinform’s operation area by taking measurements during one month of
    the Average Handle Time (AHT) before and after implementing the AIRPA platform.
    Initially, an AHT of 9 min was obtained, which was improved after implementing
    AIRPA by 75%, resulting in a final AHT of 2 min and 15 s. Even though the results
    are preliminary, the platform significantly increased control over the process,
    which suggests promising results. AIRPA is planned to be a platform and a methodological
    strategy followed by Servinform S.A. and its entire Consulting and Innovation
    area.

    defining and implementing AIRPA architecture, we have realized that it is very
    focused on high-demand situations in terms of deployments. In some real scenarios,
    the level of demand for deployments is lower because they are less frequent. Therefore,
    in that cases, such a complex architecture is not necessary, and a deployment
    pipeline would be sufficient. In addition, the experience with different real
    cases showed limited use of the shared collection of RPA components. This situation
    was mainly since each case required a level of customization that neglects its
    transversality. Nonetheless, the *wrapper* design of the components enables easy
    customization from one business case to another.

    and possible lines of future research work. (1) The project, being research-based,
    could have performance improvements and better functionalities. (2) The component
    library can be extended by adding new functionalities. (3) Currently, the data
    scientist requires an existing *wrapper* component before loading a model. The
    need to avoid the dependency of the data scientist from the RPA developer role
    and ease the modification of components is identified, so the use of preloaded
    *wrappers* is proposed as future work. (4) The current *Control Room* is a custom
    state machine (cf. Sect. [3.2](#Sec5)) and the robot is the one in charge of modifying
    the state. As future work, we plan to extend the component behavior to automatically
    generate multiple state changes and evidence transitions records.
