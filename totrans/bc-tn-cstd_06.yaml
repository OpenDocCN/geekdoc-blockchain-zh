- en: NFT stands for “nonfungible token.” It represents ownership of unique items
    and cannot be replicated on a blockchain. In Chapter [5](535492_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml),
    we introduced ERC-721 token standard. The initial ERC-721 specification was proposed
    by Dieter Shirley, William Entriken, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs in January
    2018 as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for the Ethereum network. It defines
    the standard smart contracts interface, which can represent real-world items from
    digital collectibles to music, artwork, sports, and many other real-world assets.

- en: When you acquire ownership of an NFT, you don’t get physical copy of the NFT.
    In fact, if the NFT is a form of media, anyone can still get a copy of it. But
    the important thing is that a smart contract is created to verify the buyer’s
    ownership of an NFT. Anyone can see transaction and contract history for NFTs
    on the Ethereum network, similar to how cryptocurrency transactions can be viewed
    and traced by anyone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The NFT itself, however, is typically not stored in the blockchain. The owner,
    hash, token name and symbol, and link to file are stored in blockchain. So, although
    anyone can make a copy of the NFT, that does not mean they will own or have rights
    to it. But it is important that the buyer is not always granted all rights to
    the NFT. The creator may keep copyright and licensing rights, and can earn royalties
    from resells of the NFT, as well as choose to sell multiple replicas of an NFT.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In economics, fungibility refers to something that is easy to exchange or trade
    and cannot be distinguished from another. Before a good or a commodity can be
    traded or exchanged, it must be fungible. For example, the US dollar is fungible.
    Therefore, a person holding one bill can exchange it for another bill without
    changing its stored value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every $1 bill has the same value, uniform, and usability as another quantity
    of the bill. Divisibility is another essential feature of fungibility, and it
    refers to the property of a good or a commodity that can be broken into smaller
    units without losing value. Just like a $10 bill can purchase the same amount
    of goods as two $5 bills or ten $1 bills. In the blockchain, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether
    (ETH), and many other cryptocurrency units have the same highly divisible. One
    Bitcoin should carry the same purchasing value as a medium to buy or sell goods
    regardless of whether it is split into fractions of one, two, or ten UTXOs. Most
    daily transactions will cost less than one Bitcoin, and divisibility will make
    cryptocurrency easier to exchange for other like items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous chapter, we learned about ERC-20, which introduces a standard
    way to create fungible tokens. ERC-20 defines an interface with a property, and
    each token can be exchanged the same (in type and value) as another token. Some
    popular examples are Tether Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Shiba Inu (SHIB),
    and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, nonfungible assets are unique and not interchangeable assets that
    a person or group owns, like art, car, book, real estate, diamonds, copyright,
    collectible, and game items.

- en: If a lender lends a borrower his house, it is not acceptable for a borrower
    to return to a different house and have the same ownership, even if both houses
    have the same market value. Each house has its own uniqueness. The value is judged
    across multiple complex criteria, including location, home size, usable space,
    neighborhood, and sold history.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, nonfungible assets are not divisible and cannot be broken up and
    sold in multiple pieces. The whole of the item determines the value of a nonfungible
    asset. In the blockchain, a non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset
    representing real-world items. People can buy and sell NFT from marketplace based
    on the value they believe in. Every NFT has a unique digital signature stored
    in an NFT smart contract, which provides proof of ownership to ensure they cannot
    be duplicated or destroyed in the blockchain. The blockchain will keep track of
    ownership of the NFT assets.

    at the same time, then the market may crash. However, the field of NFTs may end
    up similar to the dot.com phenomenon of the early 2000s—there may be an initial
    apprehensiveness and a large amount of speculation toward NFTs, but eventually
    they will be more integrated into society. NFTs have already proven their value
    with billions of USD in sales and millions of buyers.

    NFTs give proof of ownership, the fact that anyone can access the NFT being traded
    means that the digital goods are able to be copied and downloaded. In the future,
    as digital goods and copyright law continue to expand, we may began to lessen
    this problem.

    to the environment. According to the UK Renewable Energy Hub, each Ethereum transaction
    uses 48.14 kWh of energy. In comparison, the average kWh usage per day in a UK
    household is 8.5 to 10 kWh. However, environmental engineers and scientists have
    worked on reducing emissions from the crypto industry, such as using Proof of
    Stake (PoS) instead of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus. It is also worth mentioning
    that physical art often travels between exhibits by plane or truck, meaning physical
    art also makes a contribution to carbon footprints.

    art. As NFTs continue to give artists an opportunity to share their work digitally,
    it creates more opportunities for artists of all different backgrounds and experience.
    Artists will no longer have to rely on corporations, brands, and collectors, and
    will thus be able to explore their creative vision more and find an audience that
    supports them. NFTs can also encourage creativity, as digital work can come in
    many forms, from VR to work that can be used every day.

    of viewing art—viewers do not need to travel to the physical space the art is
    in, so people can explore galleries from anyplace, anytime. Patrons can also directly
    support artists and creators due to the direct nature of blockchain transactions.

    A paper ticket comes with the risk of being misplaced or copied, while the Ethereum
    blockchain can provide an indestructible and authentic record of ownership.

    of years. In-game items and currency being purchased and traded online is already
    common. NFTs can be the next step in securing the buyer’s ownership of digital
    assets.

    market. An NFT could be issued as a proof of ownership of property. NFTs can also
    be used as a tool for verification—schools could give students NFTs as a proof
    of a degree completion.

    the tech sector and general public: the Metaverse. NFTs are based on websites
    and typically used for digital goods, while the Metaverse is a digital space and
    VR-based. Although they may seem different at a first glance, many companies see
    potential and have found ways to combine the two topics.'

    tokens that are unique. NFTs are most commonly exchanged on the Ethereum network;
    digital signatures that show proof of ownership make it easy to transfer and purchase
    files. The next chapter will cover the basics of the Metaverse, a 3D internet
    based on new immersive technologies.
