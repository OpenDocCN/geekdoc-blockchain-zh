    This is understandable as it is often hard to envision something that has never
    been dreamed up before.

- en: '"I would imagine this scenario: in the future financial instruments linked
    to bitcoin will be finally approved. High finance will invest into the cryptocurrency
    (more than the 300M expected for the bitcoin ETF approval). I''m thinking about
    5-10 times the current price. Bitcoin will not necessarily be used as a method
    of payment (it also depends on how the size block / Segregated witness / LN matter
    will proceed or will not), but primarily it will be used as a store of value.'

    banks could issue their own cryptocurrency, while the current ones will remain
    a handful. Ethereum will consolidate as the second most important infrastructure,
    and 99% of ICO tokens will have any value."

    an exponential rate. It is hard to ignore the profit potential, the amount of
    freedom, and the financial independence that these digital currencies can bring.
    But many are wondering if this pipe dream is going to last and what does the extended
    future really hold for all of us.

    to maintain the status quo but for the most part, the future of these currencies
    are very promising. While governments have done little more than tolerate these
    innovative assets that news is spreading. In the midst of ridicule, naysayers,
    and disbelievers, cryptocurrency has become a relatively stable investment instrument
    that has provided an equalizing to its users.

    for the future. From its all-time low of $2 in the fall of 2011 to todayâ€™s high
    of more than $3,800 in 2017, it is easy to see that in spite of all the complainers,
    whiners, naysayers, and such, Bitcoin is still climbing.

    who have stuck with it and will continue to ride the wave for the foreseeable
    future.
