    should come as no small surprise, especially to those of you reading this book,
    that the business landscape at large is in the midst of a technological paradigm
    shift. That phrase may appear to be to be excessive or perhaps a little buzzworthy,
    but it is difficult to think of a word or phrase that would be equally appropriate.
    In addition to the underlying trends that are redefining society and business
    at large, namely demographic changes, the machinations of global trade, and the
    increased digitization of information, there are who new areas of business and
    science being developed as we speak. Even the new technology tools that are the
    focus of this text, however, it is important to note that the evolution, iterations,
    and developments of accounting and financial services is not necessarily new;
    the tools have continued to change rather than the goal of the tools themselves
    (Winsen and Ng [1976](#CR2)). With every new development, however, comes the proverbial
    push and pull of innovation and regulation; blockchain and artificial intelligence
    are not exempt from this market reality. These dynamics, specifically as the relate
    to the accounting profession, represent forces and changes that must acknowledged
    and addressed in a proactive manner. Accounting professionals seem to be aware
    of, from the number of articles and discussions focused around the emerging technology
    space itself, but action steps still seem to be a work in progress. Specifically,
    as of this writing, there is no authoritative or definitive guidance issued by
    any accounting institutions or bodies that have entered into the marketplace.
    To kick things off and to help frame the conversation, Fig. [2.1](#Fig1) presents
    a summary and highlight of trends that are changing the accounting profession
    from its current position to where many experts predict it will end up.![../images/467992_1_En_2_Chapter/467992_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_2_Chapter/467992_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: Put simply, accounting and financial services are a highly regulated set of
    industries, with regulations and oversight vying other tightly regulated fields
    such as healthcare and regulated power transmission and distribution. Taking the
    political winds out of the equation for the purposes of this conversation, it
    is reasonable to conclude that regulation has, continues to, and will be a powerful
    force in the fields of financial services. Traditionally the scope of regulation
    has been limited to the reporting and communication of financial information to
    a relatively narrow set of stakeholder groups – creditors and equity owners. Additionally,
    the guidance and frameworks promulgated by the FASB and IASB form the guidelines
    and standards by which much of financial information is compiled and distributed.
    In addition to all of these existing guidelines, however, the rise of the both
    blockchain and artificial intelligence leads to the following question. As financial
    services become increasingly integrated with technology tools, will technology
    style regulation begin to intrude on the profession?

    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  on May 25, 2018\. Although this regulation
    originated in the European Union and was primarily originated at technology firms
    who had access customers social information, the connection between this regulation
    and financial services is relatively clear. This regulation originated within
    the E.U., but if an organization has any information on any E.U. citizen that
    organization falls under the guise of this fairly sweeping regulation. Without
    diving into too much detail as to the specifics of this regulation, if an organization
    has any information that could be used to identify an individual, extra precautions
    and safety standards must be taken. Taking a step back, and observing the language
    of the GDPR legislation  from a market based perspective, the following conclusion
    begins to materialize. Payment and purchase information, investment information,
    trading history, accounting records, income tax payments and filings, and assorted
    other financial information can, and is, considered to be identifying data. In
    addition to the obvious compliance implications of this regulation there also
    appear to be opportunities aligned with the increased regulatory oversight of
    the profession linked changing regulation.

    to drop on the first offending organization, financial professionals need to be
    aware of other regulatory changes that are coming for the profession. In addition
    to international regulations and standards, standards in the United States – considered
    to be the most liquid and robust marketplace by many individuals – are also potentially
    going to impact the profession at large. In an almost contradictory manner, especially
    when viewed in the context of emerging technology and efficiency, technology may
    actually increase the importance of regulation. Details affiliated with these
    changes will be outlined in more detail throughout this book, but it is fair to
    say that technology and regulation need not be only seen as a hinderance or regulation,
    but rather an opportunity as well.

    the fact that, despite the confusion and debate connected to blockchain and other
    blockchain based applications at the federal level there is progress and developments
    occurring at the state level. In such a fast moving space like the ones connected
    to cryptocurrencies and blockchain at large, it is important for every practitioner
    to remain abreast of changing topics and changes occurring at every level. This
    sounds nice, clearly, but also has implications from a practical level as well,
    especially for how different types of information are treated and classified.
    No single analysis is going to encompass all of the regulatory changes in such
    a fast moving and evolving space, but there are some examples that are occurring
    that should be of interest to anyone in the financial services space.

    a variety of reasons, least of all the $100 million invested in Columbus by approximately
    half a dozen blockchain and cryptocurrency firms. These firms have attracted significant
    attention and the focus of other investment funds across the country, but are
    only one of the drivers of innovation in the state. In addition to this financial
    investment, Ohio – at the end of the year – became the first state to allow residents
    to pay local and state taxes via Bitcoin; this represents a significant change
    in how cryptocurrencies are utilized. Prior to this announcement and legal change,
    the only guidance – as will be discussed throughout this text – was the memo issued
    by the IRS in 2014 classifying cryptocurrencies are property for accounting, tax,
    and reporting purposes. Such a change, allowing residents and consumers to pay
    bills and debts is a clear shift in the development and evolution of cryptocurrencies
    from investments to full fledged currency equivalents.

    individuals would be able to pay tax bills and other issues with bitcoin and other
    cryptocurrencies. While a final decision has yet to be made, this also represents
    progress toward bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies shifting away from investment
    and opportunities to being able to used for the payment of debts and other bills.
    Even as the prices of individual cryptoassets have declined in 2018 and stabilized
    at these lower levels in 2019 these developments continue to point to greater
    increased institutional interest and development across different state and functional
    lines. These changes and developments, however, do pale in comparison to the potentially
    ground breaking work that is underway in the legislature in the state of Wyoming.
    Although cryptocurrencies may be accepting broader acceptance in terms of how
    they are used and treated for different purposes, there does remain confusion
    and murkiness connected to how blockchain is treated overall.

- en: Wyoming, beginning in 2018 and continuing in 2019, has taken a rather progressive
    and forward looking approach to the regulation and fields connected to cryptocurrency
    and blockchain overall. Mirroring a previously successful attempt to lead financial
    technologies like those utilized by Dakotas and Utah with the credit card processing
    industries in the 1970s and 1980s this may not as unusual as it may appear. Wyoming
    may not be the first place that comes to mind when the idea of a financial technology
    hub or center of excellence, but it is important to keep track of developments
    regardless of where they geographically occur. Spearheaded by a Wall Street veteran
    with decades of experience, and with bipartisan support across the legislative
    political lines it seems that these concepts have received an enthusiastic reception.
    While legislation and the ripple impact of these legislative actions may still
    have effects that are difficult to understand at this point in time the ramifications
    for financial services professionals can be forecasted with some degree of certainty.
    Drilling down into some of the changes and actions undertaken, there are a few
    items and pieces of information that should be taken into account.

    other cryptoassets, a bill, SF0125, has put forth several different classifications
    for these assets. This may seem like a minor development or change, but is significant
    in ways that are – as of yet – ultimately unable to be forecasted. Drilling down,
    this legislation breaks out different cryptoassets into three separate categories,
    and also grants cryptocurrencies the same legal status as currencies such as the
    dollars used to pay and settle other obligations within the state. Again, this
    legislation is sponsored and supported at a state level, but represents the most
    significant development and progress on these issues to date. In addition to granting
    bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the same legal status as cash within the state,
    this legislation also seeks to grant banks the ability to manage cryptoassets
    and cryptocurrencies as assets under administration.

- en: Second, and building on that last sentence, the ability of banks to manage cryptocurrencies
    marks a departure and differentiation from the previously dominant legislation
    in the space – the New York BitLicnse. Currently the only financial institutions
    that are able to offer trust and custody services around different classes of
    cryptocurrencies, which complicates matters from a financial services and legislative
    perspective. Trust companies, or organizations that are offering services via
    a trust vehicle must register with the individual 50 states in order to do business
    across state lines. From a compliance and cost perspective this also means that
    the complexity and cost associated with offering these services is such that only
    the largest and most well established players – to date – have been able to do
    so. In addition, the S.E.C. has comes publicly and stated that the trust business
    model is not the preferred model of offering cryptocurrency services. Banks offer
    two distinct benefits versus trust organizations that are important for a financial
    services perspective. The ability to (1) operate across state lines with an operating
    model that does (2) not require individual regulation or licensure in each state
    is simpler from a cost and operational perspective than doing so via a trust or
    trust based model of business.

    feel interested or able to establish a robust dialogue or engagement with other
    professionals, but is something that must be factored into any advisory service
    offerings moving forward. Whether it is something that has been established in
    different states, or changing regulatory models and frameworks being put forth
    at a national level, the implications of these changes are going to have a profound
    impact on the operations of businesses both within financial services and in other
    industries. Offering advisory services and robust client advice to both internal
    partners and external clients means that professionals need to understand both
    the financial effects of cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets as well as what
    they mean for the interactions currently underway between different business entities.
    In addition to these regulations and responsibilities, practitioners also need
    to be aware, and kept abreast of what these mean for how blockchain is evolving
    alongside other business process improvements.

    least partially, protected from the winds of disruption and change that tend to
    dominate headlines and stories, but the reality is far more nuanced. Regardless
    of which subset of the profession individual practitioners are employed within,
    there are substantial changes coming in terms of accounting regulation that are
    having a dramatic impact on both the profession and the clients that they serve.
    Specifically the changes to leasing standards, revenue recognition standards,
    and the classifications of how non-profit entities report assets and other classes
    of information are already having effects on how information and data are reported
    are already having an effect on how accounting professionals are perceived and

    postulated by the FASB and being implemented through the 2018–2020 timeframe,
    differ, the underlying trend is the same; stakeholder groups and users of organizational
    information are increasingly expecting more up-to-date and relevant data. These
    changes, and the impact that will be felt by various organizations in different
    industries, do not appear to be insignificant nor appear to be a passing trend
    within the broader business landscape. Accounting and financial professionals
    are, increasingly, expected to be able to render both quantitative information
    and the implications of this information for business decision makers. Especially
    in the context of personalized and customized reporting and customer service from
    other organizations, accounting firms and the practitioners employed therein must
    be able to provide equal levels of service and information to customers and clients.
    The primary focus of these reporting changes was, in theory, to assist with the
    understanding and interpretation of information that can otherwise be difficult
    to interpret and analyze for individuals who are not financial experts. That said,
    and understanding this as the underlying goal of these modified reporting requirements,
    accounting professionals can, and should, leverage technology to meet the expectations
    of stakeholder groups.

    guidelines or frameworks in the areas of cryptocurrencies, blockchain, or artificial

    guidance and certificate programs in the areas of blockchain, how to account for
    blockchain transactions, and the broader cryptocurrency space, but as far as authoritative
    accounting guidance and regulation there does not appear to any on the horizon
    for 2018 or 2019\. As stated above, there is certainly enough changing regulation
    and guidance entering the accounting and financial services space to certainly
    keep practitioners busy. Revenue recognition, the reporting of nonprofit financial
    information, and the changing of how leases are reported (moving from off balance
    sheet to on balance sheet) are significant issues to grapple with even without
    technology forces driving disruption. Emerging technologies and forces, including
    both blockchain and artificial intelligence, are going to have a substantial impact
    on the financial services landscape; regulation and guidance will have to keep
    pace. Now, it is important to recognize the reality that the guidance may not
    originate from the United States either – several international markets have already
    issued guidance and begun to utilize blockchain for business purposes. In any
    case, professionals will need to keep pace with the changing regulatory landscape,

    steps to become increasingly integrated to the traditional financial system. A
    brief example, which will be revisited later throughout this text, is the continued
    integration and development of blockchain based applications for payment processors
    and payment service. SWIFT, which is in essence the underpinning of the global
    financial and payments system, is how funds and amounts are transferred between
    virtually every bank, credit card company, or financial services institution.
    An figure of just how important this system is the impact on countries that have
    been banned or barred from this system – such as North Korea and Iran at different
    times – have suffered dramatic economic contractions. Unable to conduct business

    partnership with the SWIFT network to handle and develop blockchain based options
    and alternatives for global payment processing. Especially as it connects to the
    enterprise applications and payments that can be facilitated via blockchain based
    platforms perhaps the most appropriate place to begin this analysis is with international
    payment and remittances. These transfers, even under the current model utilizing
    the most sophisticated payment structures and channels, can take days to settle
    and even longer to reconcile between the different institutions involved. A credit
    card payment, for example, or a simple remittance of funds from a family member
    to other family members can take an extremely long time to settle and become finalized.
    Blockchain, especially the platform utilizing R3’s technology – developed and
    tested for enterprise applications – means that these current pain points and
    obstacles can be addressed in a comprehensive manner from start to finish. Although
    the application and development of these technology platforms are still a work
    in progress at this time it does point to how integrated blockchain can, and might
    become full meshed within the global financial system.

    it is undeniable that technology and technological innovation is having a profound
    impact on the accounting profession. Blockchain and artificial intelligence, including
    the application of cryptocurrencies in the media landscape, have certainly received
    large amounts of attention and media coverage, but this is merely the most high
    profile application of blockchain technology in the broader business landscape.
    Blockchain, at the core of the idea, is a decentralized ledger system that allows
    encrypted information to be communicated in nearly real time to everyone who is
    part of the network. These dual forces, the encryption and real time dissemination
    of the information itself represents a paradigm shift for how information is created,
    transmitted, and communicated both within organizations and to external stakeholders.
    While it is true that technology integration is not necessarily a new force or
    trend within the accounting profession, the embedded nature of new and emerging
    tools has the potential to change the profession from the top to bottom.

    account is that, while the technical terminology, acronyms, and jargon may have
    evolved and changed that the underlying drive and push toward greater technology
    integration has remained consistent. Automation, digitization, and the increased
    utilization of technology to handle the decision making process are forces that
    have been in existence for several decades. From the beginning of the internet
    and computer revolution, technology has been leveraged and utilized by the financial
    services profession to achieve two goals (Caruso [2016](#CR1)). First, an overarching
    goal is to drive down the cost that financial services provided to end users,
    which mirrors the drive toward lower costs that consumers have come to expect
    from other areas of the market. Second, and building on the drive toward lower
    costs and increased service, the ability of financial professionals to take advantage
    of technology advances to expand and offer additional services forms a core of
    how many institutions have thrived following the financial crises. Applying the
    insights and information already in possession of the organization to new areas
    and additional products is a substantive way to add value.

    for decades, would be an unstoppable force in the business landscape by itself,
    but it has been amplified by recent developments and iterations of technology
    tools. Blockchain, a decentralized and distributed ledger system, is positioned
    to – at least to a certain extent – completely reinvent and overhaul how records
    and other types of information are kept. From a market perspective, it is also
    evident that decentralizing the transfer of information and record keeping will

    An important point to remember, however, is that while the terminology and specifics
    of certain technologies may have changed during the last several years, the underlying
    point and purpose of technology for accounting purposes has not changed. While
    it is true that technology will automate and streamline processes, which will
    eliminate certain lower level jobs, tasks, and processes, it is important to remember
    that with every process that is automated there will be additional opportunities.
    As lower level tasks become automated, delegated, and outsourced to other professionals,
    accounting professionals will have to keep pace, evolve, and evolve alongside
    the broader business forces impacting organizations at large. Technology, certainly,
    holds potential for the profession and accounting practitioners at large, but
    it is arguably more important for accounting professionals to have the ability
    to understand how these tools functions and can improve the profession rather

    subset of the workforce that has not radically embraced technology nor usually
    been at the forefront of innovation. Such a resistance to change, innovation,
    and disruptive forces is not terribly surprising when taken in the context of
    accounting and the services performed by accounting professionals. Whenever accounting
    has been up front with experimenting with innovation, such as the creative or
    innovative practices utilized at organizations such as Enron, WorldCom, and Lehman
    Brothers the end result has been the failure of accounting firms and practitioners.
    Auditing, tax reporting, attest processes, and advisory services are experiencing
    a potential paradigm shift in how information is reported, who receives this information,
    and what the end result of this information is for end users. Financial services,
    including both accounting and finance professionals, have not yet been keeping
    up with the rapid digitization and transition of services. Redefining the profession,

    the next generation of professionals, the ability of financial services professionals
    to move up the value chain will, in large, define the next stage of competitive
    advantages put forth by individuals and organizations. Effectively leveraging
    technology forces will, without a doubt, transform the profession from virtually
    top to bottom, but one specific application of technology that is already emerging
    as a leading indicator is automation. Drilling down, there are several trends

    reconciliations, bookkeeping, income tax reporting, and even basic portfolio allocation
    will increasingly be able to be completed by non-accounting professionals, requiring
    CPAs and other financial professionals to focus instead of more advisory and customer-centric
    activities. Second, as certain tasks are augmented, automated, or even outsourced
    in virtually their entirety, financial services professionals must be able to
    understand and apply technology tools and applications as they apply to tasks
    done with internal and external colleagues. Third, and perhaps most importantly,
    one of the most direct and practical implications of this increased technological
    integration will be hard decisions that have to be made across different organizations.

    in the past, may also open opportunities for professionals to embrace higher level,

    performed by individuals members of the profession. Regardless of industry subset
    the trends and implications had been that the primary service and value delivered

    effects and impacts that need to be assessed. First, some jobs will be eliminated,
    and that is a fact that cannot be explained away no matter how eloquent or forceful
    the thoughts are. While it is true that some of the jobs that will be eliminated
    are primarily lower level jobs or tasks performed by newer entrants to the workforce
    the reality is that these jobs still count and provide valuable internal and external
    services for both the organization and clients. In addition to the jobs that are
    going to either be severely augmented or eliminated altogether as a result of
    this increased automation, training and education practices will also have to

    professional classes, but perhaps a more appropriate designation for this activity
    would be delegation. Put simply, and building on the reality that certain tasks
    are going to automated regardless of whether the process is embraced by professionals
    or not, delegating lower level, lower margin, or tasks that the organization is
    not especially efficient at should be a component of business planning moving
    forward. Organizations, both accounting and financial specific, already exist
    in the marketplace that have employed different outsourcing and virtual functions
    to improve services to clients, generating additional lines of revenue, and create
    opportunities to attract new clients. Outsourcing or delegation, regardless of
    the specific terminology and phraseology used to introduce and discuss, is going
    to be part of the professional conversation and landscape in the near, medium,
    and long-term. Drilling down and examining what tasks are ripe for outsourcing
    is a fiduciary duty and responsibility of financial services teams across industry

    and iteration of how technology is driving change in the financial services landscape,
    but not in the traditional sense that most organizations and professionals have
    examined outsourcing through. Technology, instead of management decision making,
    is now the overarching force driving outsourcing, augmentation, and redefining
    or roles and responsibilities across financial services professionals. As indicated
    above and throughout this text, automation and distributing of information continues
    to drive the disruption and change that are causing such anxiety and stress in
    some professionals circles. Current roles and processes are being either automated

    or external to the organization represent a question and consideration that every
    financial professional must be able to analyze and facto into a decision making
    framework. While clearly every organization is different, contains a variety of
    personnel, and focuses on different service offerings, the decision and criteria
    to evaluate the decision to outsource or not connects back to several core areas.
    First, core functions and services offered by the organization to both internal
    and external clients are usually not outsourced regardless of the short term analysis.
    Second, if the transfer of confidential information or intellectual property is
    involved this usually means that the outsourcing is not a viable option or alternative
    to retaining such services in house. Third, and perhaps most importantly from
    the point of view of financial services professionals is that if collaboration
    or coordination is a required part of this outsourcing that usually – in effect –
    means that the outsourcing will not occur. Blockchain and other emerging technologies,
    given the disruptive nature of the tools themselves, have the potential to change
    the conversation as it connects to outsourcing, developing new services lines,
    and entering into new marketplaces.

    lines, including the financial professional landscape, there is an enhanced spirit
    of coordination and collaboration between different organizations. While it is,
    of course, interesting from a theoretical perspective that organizations may be
    sharing information, this also has a tangible and real world effect on organizations
    as well. Usually what occurs in the financial services landscape is that the organizations
    and firms employed within this landscape are usually fiercely competitive in nature
    for clients, future clients, and new lines of business. The very nature of these
    emerging technologies, but specifically blockchain, is that this information should
    be communicated, distributed, and shared between different organizations. Such
    a system may seem anathema to how financial organizations usually operate, but
    actually is reflective of broader trends underway in the marketplace. Clients
    and customers, both current and potential future clients, are increasingly used
    to platforms, interfaces, portals, and other methods of communicating information;
    this also applies to financial services as well as other types of information.

    but in the context of data, automated analysis of information, and the distribution
    of information between different partner organizations this decision will become
    more complicated. Rather then facilitating the ease with which such data can be
    communicated, the increased technological integration may actually limit or raise
    other issues connected to data sharing and processing. Even if the data included
    in this sharing and communication is encrypted in nature, organizations still
    must take into account the liabilities and potential exposure. Liability, analyzing
    the importance of assessing and evaluating liability on a continuous basis, and
    the integration of said risk assessments to the broader decision making process
    means that practitioners should be able to offer holistic solutions to these multifaceted

    and financial services industries, are already facing multiple pressures and forces
    driving change, disruption, and innovation throughout the profession. Pressure
    on margins, fee compression, increased competition from non-financial professionals
    already cause anxiety, stress, and operational concerns as far as staffing is
    concerned. Technology forces, especially as ones as innovative and disruptive
    as the trifecta of blockchain, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrencies can
    seem like just one more task to go on the proverbial to-do list. That said, it
    is important for managers to not only understand the underlying trends driven
    by technology, but also an analysis and understanding of who is already using
    them. In addition to these other forces, it is important that the connection between
    technology, recruitment, and retention are well established. Even if some members
    of the organization do not feel, for example, like investing in, or learning emerging
    technologies is justified, the reality of the situation is far different. Simply
    stated, in order for organizations to be able to survive and thrive in the current
    and figure business landscape, obtaining institutional knowledge of these technologies
    is a requirement.

    intelligence going to fundamentally change and alter how financial transactions
    occur and are recorded, but will also change how employees are evaluated. As the
    roles of practitioners continue to evolve and change, it is not a far stretch
    to imagine a business environment where the methods of evaluation must also change.
    For example, and definitely worthy of additional analysis, is the following question.
    How does a manager evaluate someone who supervises automated processes, software
    bots, or other technology driven processes? Are the evaluation criteria different
    from those used to evaluate a manager who only manages people? How would the manager
    be able to obtain feedback as to the effectiveness of the manager, and if feedback
    is required what counts as feedback from a machine? These are not idle questions;
    the development and promotion and development of a whole new set of leaders depends
    on how effectively or not organizations are able to move with these trends.

    situation, why should margins remain at current levels? As the pressure for free
    or extremely low cost investing options, for example, continues to increase and

    the role of intermediary, interpreting information and transmitting the implications
    of said data, appear to be ripe for disruption with the advent of smart contracts.

    cryptographic currency such as bitcoin. While bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
    may have originally been designed as an alternative to the traditional fiat based
    financial system, many of the most prominent investors and user of cryptocurrencies
    are those same traditional market actors. Banks, financial institutions, financial
    advisory professionals, and accounting professionals are all investing billions
    of dollars into the broader cryptocurrency space. Such investment is being done
    for two primary reasons, and neither one of which connects to the initial underlying
    aspiration of cryptocurrencies to establish an alternative financial system.

    groups investing time and energy into the space. On the blockchain side, hundreds

    solutions, and are documenting the results of the initiatives. From logistics
    coordination, to food safety, to the tracking of different inventory items across
    national and international lines, the applications for blockchain appear to be
    multiplying continuously. These organizations, regardless of specific industry
    subset, represent current and future clients for financial services professionals.
    In order to provide meaningful and valuable services to these organizations, financial
    services firms are going to have to keep pace with at the least educating themselves.
    Second, the proliferation of different cryptocurrencies continues to accelerate
    as well as shift and evolve beyond simply bitcoin and other early market entrants.
