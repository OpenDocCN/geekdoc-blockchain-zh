    should come as no small surprise, especially to those of you reading this book,
    that the business landscape at large is in the midst of a technological paradigm
    shift. That phrase may appear to be to be excessive or perhaps a little buzzworthy,
    but it is difficult to think of a word or phrase that would be equally appropriate.
    In addition to the underlying trends that are redefining society and business
    at large, namely demographic changes, the machinations of global trade, and the
    increased digitization of information, there are who new areas of business and
    science being developed as we speak. Even the new technology tools that are the
    focus of this text, however, it is important to note that the evolution, iterations,
    and developments of accounting and financial services is not necessarily new;
    the tools have continued to change rather than the goal of the tools themselves
    (Winsen and Ng [1976](#CR2)). With every new development, however, comes the proverbial
    push and pull of innovation and regulation; blockchain and artificial intelligence
    are not exempt from this market reality. These dynamics, specifically as the relate
    to the accounting profession, represent forces and changes that must acknowledged
    and addressed in a proactive manner. Accounting professionals seem to be aware
    of, from the number of articles and discussions focused around the emerging technology
    space itself, but action steps still seem to be a work in progress. Specifically,
    as of this writing, there is no authoritative or definitive guidance issued by
    any accounting institutions or bodies that have entered into the marketplace.
    To kick things off and to help frame the conversation, Fig. [2.1](#Fig1) presents
    a summary and highlight of trends that are changing the accounting profession
    from its current position to where many experts predict it will end up.![../images/467992_1_En_2_Chapter/467992_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_2_Chapter/467992_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: Put simply, accounting and financial services are a highly regulated set of
    industries, with regulations and oversight vying other tightly regulated fields
    such as healthcare and regulated power transmission and distribution. Taking the
    political winds out of the equation for the purposes of this conversation, it
    is reasonable to conclude that regulation has, continues to, and will be a powerful
    force in the fields of financial services. Traditionally the scope of regulation
    has been limited to the reporting and communication of financial information to
    a relatively narrow set of stakeholder groups – creditors and equity owners. Additionally,
    the guidance and frameworks promulgated by the FASB and IASB form the guidelines
    and standards by which much of financial information is compiled and distributed.
    In addition to all of these existing guidelines, however, the rise of the both
    blockchain and artificial intelligence leads to the following question. As financial
    services become increasingly integrated with technology tools, will technology
    style regulation begin to intrude on the profession?

- en: This is not an academic or theoretical question with the passing into law the
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  on May 25, 2018\. Although this regulation
    originated in the European Union and was primarily originated at technology firms
    who had access customers social information, the connection between this regulation
    and financial services is relatively clear. This regulation originated within
    the E.U., but if an organization has any information on any E.U. citizen that
    organization falls under the guise of this fairly sweeping regulation. Without
    diving into too much detail as to the specifics of this regulation, if an organization
    has any information that could be used to identify an individual, extra precautions
    and safety standards must be taken. Taking a step back, and observing the language
    of the GDPR legislation  from a market based perspective, the following conclusion
    begins to materialize. Payment and purchase information, investment information,
    trading history, accounting records, income tax payments and filings, and assorted
    other financial information can, and is, considered to be identifying data. In
    addition to the obvious compliance implications of this regulation there also
    appear to be opportunities aligned with the increased regulatory oversight of
    the profession linked changing regulation.

  zh: 2018年5月25日《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）的颁布并非一个学术或理论问题。尽管这项法规起源于欧盟，最初是针对访问客户社交信息的科技公司，但这项法规与金融服务之间的联系相对清晰。这项法规起源于欧盟，但如果一家组织拥有任何欧盟公民的信息，该组织就会受到这项相当广泛的法规的监管。如果不深入讨论该法规的具体细节，一旦一家组织拥有任何可用于识别个人的信息，就必须采取额外的预防措施和安全标准。退一步看，从市场的角度审视GDPR立法语言，以下结论开始浮现。支付和购买信息、投资信息、交易历史、会计记录、所得税支付和申报以及其他各种财务信息被认为是可以识别数据。除了这项法规的明显合规影响外，似乎还有机会与增加的监管监督以及相关法规的变化相关联的机会。

    to be the most liquid and robust marketplace by many individuals – are also potentially
    going to impact the profession at large. In an almost contradictory manner, especially
    when viewed in the context of emerging technology and efficiency, technology may
    actually increase the importance of regulation. Details affiliated with these

    half a dozen blockchain and cryptocurrency firms. These firms have attracted significant
    attention and the focus of other investment funds across the country, but are
    only one of the drivers of innovation in the state. In addition to this financial
    investment, Ohio – at the end of the year – became the first state to allow residents
    to pay local and state taxes via Bitcoin; this represents a significant change
    in how cryptocurrencies are utilized. Prior to this announcement and legal change,
    the only guidance – as will be discussed throughout this text – was the memo issued
    by the IRS in 2014 classifying cryptocurrencies are property for accounting, tax,
    and reporting purposes. Such a change, allowing residents and consumers to pay

    and opportunities to being able to used for the payment of debts and other bills.
    Even as the prices of individual cryptoassets have declined in 2018 and stabilized
    at these lower levels in 2019 these developments continue to point to greater
    increased institutional interest and development across different state and functional
    lines. These changes and developments, however, do pale in comparison to the potentially
    ground breaking work that is underway in the legislature in the state of Wyoming.

    industries in the 1970s and 1980s this may not as unusual as it may appear. Wyoming

    hub or center of excellence, but it is important to keep track of developments
    regardless of where they geographically occur. Spearheaded by a Wall Street veteran
    with decades of experience, and with bipartisan support across the legislative
    political lines it seems that these concepts have received an enthusiastic reception.

- en: First, and perhaps most importantly for the treatment of cryptocurrencies and
    other cryptoassets, a bill, SF0125, has put forth several different classifications
    for these assets. This may seem like a minor development or change, but is significant
    in ways that are – as of yet – ultimately unable to be forecasted. Drilling down,
    this legislation breaks out different cryptoassets into three separate categories,
    and also grants cryptocurrencies the same legal status as currencies such as the
    dollars used to pay and settle other obligations within the state. Again, this
    legislation is sponsored and supported at a state level, but represents the most
    significant development and progress on these issues to date. In addition to granting
    bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the same legal status as cash within the state,
    this legislation also seeks to grant banks the ability to manage cryptoassets
    and cryptocurrencies as assets under administration.

  zh: 首先，对于加密货币和其他加密资产的处理，一项名为SF0125的法案提出了对这些资产的几种不同分类。这可能看起来像是一个小的发展或变化，但从长远来看，它具有重大意义，其后果目前还无法预测。细看这项立法，它将不同的加密资产分为三类，并也赋予了加密货币与美元等货币相同的法律地位，用于支付和结算州内的其他债务。再次强调，这项立法是在州级别提出和支持的，但代表了迄今为止在这些问题上最重大的进展和进步。除了赋予比特币和其他加密货币与现金相同的法律地位之外，这项立法还旨在赋予银行管理加密资产和加密货币作为受管理资产的能力。
- en: Second, and building on that last sentence, the ability of banks to manage cryptocurrencies
    marks a departure and differentiation from the previously dominant legislation
    in the space – the New York BitLicnse. Currently the only financial institutions
    that are able to offer trust and custody services around different classes of
    cryptocurrencies, which complicates matters from a financial services and legislative
    perspective. Trust companies, or organizations that are offering services via
    a trust vehicle must register with the individual 50 states in order to do business
    across state lines. From a compliance and cost perspective this also means that
    the complexity and cost associated with offering these services is such that only
    the largest and most well established players – to date – have been able to do
    so. In addition, the S.E.C. has comes publicly and stated that the trust business
    model is not the preferred model of offering cryptocurrency services. Banks offer
    two distinct benefits versus trust organizations that are important for a financial
    services perspective. The ability to (1) operate across state lines with an operating
    model that does (2) not require individual regulation or licensure in each state
    is simpler from a cost and operational perspective than doing so via a trust or
    trust based model of business.

  zh: 第二，基于上述最后一句，银行管理加密货币的能力标志着与此前主导立法空间的纽约BitLicense有所不同。目前，唯一能够提供不同类型加密货币的信托和托管服务的金融机构，这使得从金融服务和立法角度来看事情变得更加复杂。信托公司或通过信托工具提供服务的组织必须在各个50个州注册，才能跨州开展业务。从合规和成本角度来看，这也意味着提供这些服务的复杂性和成本只有迄今为止最大和最成熟的参与者才能做到。此外，美国证券交易委员会公开表示，信托业务模式并非提供加密货币服务的首选模式。银行相对于信托机构提供了两个重要的金融服务优势。首先，可以跨州运营，而不需要在每个州进行单独管理或许可，这在成本和运营的角度来看更为简单，而这通过信托或基于信托的商业模式来做则更为复杂。

    different states, or changing regulatory models and frameworks being put forth
    at a national level, the implications of these changes are going to have a profound
    impact on the operations of businesses both within financial services and in other
    industries. Offering advisory services and robust client advice to both internal
    partners and external clients means that professionals need to understand both
    the financial effects of cryptocurrencies and other cryptoassets as well as what
    they mean for the interactions currently underway between different business entities.

    postulated by the FASB and being implemented through the 2018–2020 timeframe,

    changes, and the impact that will be felt by various organizations in different
    industries, do not appear to be insignificant nor appear to be a passing trend

    in the context of personalized and customized reporting and customer service from
    other organizations, accounting firms and the practitioners employed therein must
    be able to provide equal levels of service and information to customers and clients.
    The primary focus of these reporting changes was, in theory, to assist with the

    partnership with the SWIFT network to handle and develop blockchain based options
    and alternatives for global payment processing. Especially as it connects to the
    enterprise applications and payments that can be facilitated via blockchain based
    platforms perhaps the most appropriate place to begin this analysis is with international
    payment and remittances. These transfers, even under the current model utilizing
    the most sophisticated payment structures and channels, can take days to settle
    and even longer to reconcile between the different institutions involved. A credit
    card payment, for example, or a simple remittance of funds from a family member
    to other family members can take an extremely long time to settle and become finalized.
    Blockchain, especially the platform utilizing R3’s technology – developed and
    tested for enterprise applications – means that these current pain points and
    obstacles can be addressed in a comprehensive manner from start to finish. Although
    the application and development of these technology platforms are still a work
    in progress at this time it does point to how integrated blockchain can, and might
    become full meshed within the global financial system.

    it is undeniable that technology and technological innovation is having a profound
    impact on the accounting profession. Blockchain and artificial intelligence, including
    the application of cryptocurrencies in the media landscape, have certainly received
    large amounts of attention and media coverage, but this is merely the most high
    profile application of blockchain technology in the broader business landscape.
    Blockchain, at the core of the idea, is a decentralized ledger system that allows
    encrypted information to be communicated in nearly real time to everyone who is
    part of the network. These dual forces, the encryption and real time dissemination
    of the information itself represents a paradigm shift for how information is created,
    transmitted, and communicated both within organizations and to external stakeholders.
    While it is true that technology integration is not necessarily a new force or
    trend within the accounting profession, the embedded nature of new and emerging
    tools has the potential to change the profession from the top to bottom.

    evolved and changed that the underlying drive and push toward greater technology
    integration has remained consistent. Automation, digitization, and the increased
    utilization of technology to handle the decision making process are forces that
    have been in existence for several decades. From the beginning of the internet
    and computer revolution, technology has been leveraged and utilized by the financial
    services profession to achieve two goals (Caruso [2016](#CR1)). First, an overarching
    goal is to drive down the cost that financial services provided to end users,
    which mirrors the drive toward lower costs that consumers have come to expect
    from other areas of the market. Second, and building on the drive toward lower
    costs and increased service, the ability of financial professionals to take advantage
    of technology advances to expand and offer additional services forms a core of
    how many institutions have thrived following the financial crises. Applying the
    insights and information already in possession of the organization to new areas
    and additional products is a substantive way to add value.

    技术力量，尤其是一些像区块链、人工智能和加密货币这样创新和颠覆性的技术，似乎只是待办事项清单上的一项任务。 也就是说，重要的不仅仅是经理们要理解技术驱动的潜在趋势，还得分析和理解谁已经在使用它们。
    除了这些其它力量，技术、招聘和保留人才之间的联系也很重要。 即使组织中的一些成员认为，比如说投资或学习新兴技术不是合理的，但情况的现实却截然不同。 简单地说，为了组织能够在当前和未来的商业环境中生存和发展，获得这些技术的机构知识是必要的。

    to understand just how to implement these tools if the desire is to leverage said
    tools to improve performance. Not only are the trends of blockchain and artificial
    intelligence going to fundamentally change and alter how financial transactions
    occur and are recorded, but will also change how employees are evaluated. As the
    roles of practitioners continue to evolve and change, it is not a far stretch
    to imagine a business environment where the methods of evaluation must also change.
    For example, and definitely worthy of additional analysis, is the following question.
    How does a manager evaluate someone who supervises automated processes, software
    bots, or other technology driven processes? Are the evaluation criteria different
    from those used to evaluate a manager who only manages people? How would the manager
    be able to obtain feedback as to the effectiveness of the manager, and if feedback
    is required what counts as feedback from a machine? These are not idle questions;
    the development and promotion and development of a whole new set of leaders depends
    on how effectively or not organizations are able to move with these trends.

    outside of the specific technical topics introduced in Chap. [1](467992_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml),
    highlighting the importance of adaptability and being able evolve alongside broader
    market trends. Of importance for professionals and practitioners seeking to understand,
    advise on, and consult with organizations linked to emerging technology, these
    definitions and technical examples are presented in a way that is user friendly.
    Automation, the outsourcing of some core trends and components of specific tasks,
    and the digitization of heretofore manual or human led tasks are just a few of
    the underlying market forces that are discussed and analyzed through the lens
    of emerging technology in this chapter. Regardless of whether an individual or
    organization are embracing emerging technology, or approaching more cautiously,
    the facts remains that these trends are indeed coming for the profession. Additionally,
    and incorporating the practitioner oriented mindset and framework of this text,
    Chap. [2](467992_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml) also introduces examples and applications
    of where said emerging technology tools are being used. Other examples will be
    included in supplemental material at the end of this book.

  zh: 如果第[1](467992_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml)章介绍并最初呈现将构成技术基础的主题，那么本章将在更重要的职业背景中加强和框定技术讨论，对话重心和焦点从概念转向更具体的例子和趋势。本章将深入探讨除了第[1](467992_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml)章介绍的具体技术主题之外的核心趋势和力量，强调适应性和能够与更广泛的市场趋势同步演进的重要性。对于希望了解、提供建议和咨询与新兴技术相关的组织的专业人士和从业者来说，这些定义和技术示例以用户友好的方式呈现。自动化、某些核心趋势和特定任务的组件外包，以及迄今为止由人工手动完成的任务的数字化只是本章通过新兴技术的视角讨论和分析的一些基础市场力量。无论个人还是组织是抱着开放态度接受新兴技术，还是持更加谨慎的态度，事实是这些趋势确实正在影响这个行业。另外，结合本文的从业者导向思维和框架，第[2](467992_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml)章还介绍了新兴技术工具的应用和例子。其他例子将包含在本书末尾的补充材料中。
