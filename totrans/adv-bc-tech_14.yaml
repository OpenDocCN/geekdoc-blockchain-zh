    Marketing is the only way to expand businesses and attract, engage, and retain
    consumers by concentrating on different marketing methods and channels [[10](#CR10)].
    In recent years, online platforms, social media (such as Facebook, Google, and
    Twitter), and digital technology have emerged as the primary methods for engaging
    with consumers [[25](#CR25)]. Digital marketing is the practice of offering services
    and products to people via the Internet and digital channels [[25](#CR25)]. In
    recent years, the marketing sector has seen a change, leading to the complete
    digitalization of marketing activities [[13](#CR13)]. Smart technologies such
    as blockchain, big data, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality, and
    virtual reality are some of the new technologies driven by the expansion of industry
    4.0 [[45](#CR45)]. Industry 4.0 will be fully automated, enabling superior customer
    service speed and efficiency and secure data processing and creating a safe and
    secure cyber environment [[53](#CR53)].

    It is becoming increasingly popular because it is a great monitoring tool for
    tracking real-time references to a business product [[25](#CR25)]. However, digital
    marketing has not been possible to attain its full potential because of the increased
    number of security and privacy breaches, such as identity theft and financial
    fraud [[27](#CR27)]. Businesses must be mindful of the security and privacy risks
    for their operations and their consumers [[16](#CR16)]. The detection and blocking
    of risks and fundamental awareness are all essential security measures [[27](#CR27)].
    In the digital marketing approach and Web presence, security awareness and an
    appropriate level of skepticism should be the first instruments that marketers
    employ [[28](#CR28)].

    or concerns about the security of their personal information as the reason [[5](#CR5)].
    Clearly, digital marketing transactions demand disclosure to the seller of a considerable
    amount of sensitive personal information, putting consumer identity and financial
    security at substantial risk [[5](#CR5)]. For digital marketing to thrive into
    the future, it is critical to consider and, more importantly, properly define
    consumer trust [[7](#CR7)]. To reach millions of consumers and generate reliable
    data, modern Internet technologies such as the blockchain, Internet of things
    (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics have largely replaced
    traditional digital marketing [[29](#CR29)]. Privacy, security, and trust are
    three of the most pressing issues facing digital marketing today [[11](#CR11)].
    Blockchain technology will have the capacity and potential to disrupt many parts
    of the digital marketing industry [[4](#CR4)]. The research will examine the effectiveness
    of digital marketing in the integration of industry 4.0 technologies. Today, big
    companies have a significant role in setting digital marketing conditions, resulting
    in privacy concerns [[31](#CR31)]. Furthermore, there is room for improvement
    in the accuracy of current digital advertising and targeting strategies. A potential
    solution to both of these difficulties is incorporating blockchain technology
    into digital marketing campaigns [[54](#CR54)].

    tool for the establishment of key business processes and for influencing consumers’
    buying patterns and purchasing decisions [[25](#CR25)]. While digital marketing
    provides an opportunity to spread information about the products and services
    offered by businesses, it also gives a platform for interactions and consideration
    of consumer expectations or viewpoints [[25](#CR25)]. Companies can shift from
    dialogue to trialogue in their relationships with consumers, in which consumers
    engage in important relationships with one another and with the businesses [[10](#CR10)].
    Blockchain technology is an important component in the new industry 4.0 revolution
    since it offers capabilities foundation that supports various industry applications
    [[13](#CR13)]. The influence of industry 4.0 and blockchain on digital marketing
    strategy will bring a range of new opportunities for online presence. In addition
    to increasing operational efficiencies through smart digital marketing strategies,
    industry 4.0 will create new potential for growth through innovation and tailored

    of the industrial revolution [[45](#CR45)]. Industry 4.0 is concerned with using
    new technologies to integrate things, individuals, and machines in the organization
    to develop a new type of networked value chain [[45](#CR45)]. In the context of
    digital marketing, industry 4.0 involves an improved degree of faith and privacy
    and minimizes risk [[21](#CR21)]. E-commerce security refers to components that
    impact digital marketing, such as computer security, data security, integrity,
    availability, and other aspects of the information security framework that are
    more broadly applicable [[31](#CR31)]. According to Attaran and Attaran [[9](#CR9)],
    digital marketing is experiencing consistent growth (approximately 19 % per year),
    and it is a comfortable method of purchasing for many buyers. Trust is essential
    for successful commerce, and consumers are reluctant to make purchases unless
    they have confidence in the seller [[39](#CR39)].

- en: Blockchain is a digital ledger technology (DLT) that establishes a blockchain
    that nobody can access [[1](#CR1)]. It contains block value, hash, time-stamping,
    cryptography, consensus algorithm, and peer-to-peer networks that provide decentralized,
    transparent, and cybersecured services without a trusted intermediary [[1](#CR1)].
    The model of cryptography was combined with blockchain and other technologies
    to create modern cryptocurrency by Nakamoto in 2008 [[41](#CR41)]. The launch
    of cryptocurrency “Bitcoin” in 2009 attracted the world to blockchain technology.
    Dramatic developments and advancements in blockchain technology enable blockchain-based
    applications across financial sector, healthcare, e-signature and document management
    systems, digital bonds, remittance, crowdfunding, smart contracts, IoT, and security
    services [[41](#CR41)].

- en: A distributed ledger is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) used across
    multiple locations and people, eliminating the need for a single authority to
    control manipulation. Distributed ledgers are intrinsically tougher robust as
    all of the distributed copies need to be attacked simultaneously for an attack
    to be successful [[3](#CR3)]. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that stores sets
    of information in blocks, and it is one of the most widely used today [[1](#CR1)].
    Blockchain is an emerging digital marketing technology that positively influences
    marketers and shifts the consumer-company relationship to new heights [[25](#CR25)].
    Blockchain has brought new ways of communicating with clients, and substantial
    changes to the marketing mix and marketing programs are on the horizon for businesses
    [[54](#CR54)]. Specifically, according to Hariguna et al. [[26](#CR26)], a design
    that integrates these qualities supports higher levels of security. A system that
    does not rely on intermediaries fosters confidence while also lowering transaction
    costs. Due to privacy and security concerns over digital marketing, blockchain
    technology can aid in the development of trust in the digital marketing industry,
    where transparency and privacy concerns are high in customers’ eyes [[46](#CR46)].
    Additionally, the decentralized ledger helps mitigate risks of a network failure
    due to malicious attacks.

    concerns of Internet users [[12](#CR12)]. The advancement in Internet technologies
    and the increasing trend of online shopping put users at the forefront of new
    challenges like trust, privacy, security, and transparency [[49](#CR49)]. Each
    online transaction on conventional networks leaves behind a digital track of comprehensive
    information about the consumer, shopping preferences, identity, and shopping habits
    [[49](#CR49)]. A weblog record for tracking consumer online activities and a cookies-based
    approach can compromise consumers’ privacy [[49](#CR49)]. Consumers are now aware
    that website cookies store personal information and track their activity, further
    increasing consumer concerns around privacy. In the online marketing context,
    cyberattack on data transactions, unauthorized access of hackers, and illegal
    use of credit cards are still security threats [[34](#CR34)]. Further, the implementation
    of data mining technologies enables marketing companies to easily identify, track,
    and collect information from their consumers [[49](#CR49)].

    of online purchasing. Digital marketing heavily relies on big data for advertisement
    and marketing [[32](#CR32)]. The consumer has the right to decide when and how
    much information related to their data will be shared and disclosed to marketing
    companies. Only the consumer has the authorization key to share the data with
    requesting parties [[4](#CR4)]. Blockchain enables consumers to protect their
    identity by pseudonymity, control their data, and protect it from being monetized
    by third parties [[24](#CR24)]. Blockchain technology will help to eliminate the
    concerns related to data privacy and cybersecurity [[2](#CR2)]. In the next section,
    we will discuss the impacts of blockchain in digital marketing in detail.

    marketing field may be on its way. Blockchain could allow marketers to use micropayment
    to encourage consumers to share personal information without involving the intermediary
    (Facebook or Google) the third party to share information. Advertising fraud is
    the biggest challenge faced by the digital marketer of current years [[52](#CR52)].
    Bots can generate fake clicks or fraudulent impressions that simulate the actual
    clicks. Ad fraud can take many shapes. An estimate of the World Federation of
    Advertisers suggests that ad fraud could reach more than $50 billion by 2025 if
    it is not countered by the authorities [[52](#CR52)]. A blockchain-based direct
    link can be established between the advertiser and the publisher using smart contracts
    to combat these ad fraud activities. In this way, the advertiser knows how the
    ad is circulated on the ad network and the number and timing of consumers who
    see the ad. Thus, the landscape of digital marketing can be revolutionized by
    enabling blockchain technology for digital advertising to attract consumers.

  zh: 鉴于区块链在工业4.0中的潜力，数字营销领域的革命可能正在途中。区块链可以让营销人员使用微支付来鼓励消费者共享个人信息，而不涉及中间商（Facebook或Google）的第三方分享信息。广告欺诈是当前数字营销人员面临的最大挑战[[52](#CR52)]。机器人可以生成模拟实际点击的虚假点击或欺诈印象。广告欺诈可以采取多种形式。据世界广告主联合会估计，如果没有当局采取措施，广告欺诈可能会在2025年达到超过500亿美元[[52](#CR52)]。可以使用智能合约在广告商和发布者之间建立基于区块链的直接链接，以打击这些广告欺诈活动。通过这种方式，广告商知道广告在广告网络上的传播方式以及看到广告的消费者的数量和时间。因此，通过为数字广告吸引消费者启用区块链技术，数字营销的格局可以得到改变。
- en: This section will review the impacts of using blockchain technology on digital
    marketing. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger that works on
    cryptographic algorithms and peer-to-peer (P2P)-based networks [[51](#CR51)].
    The information stored in the blockchain is cybersecure and cannot be tampered
    with or deleted [[3](#CR3)]. Each transaction in the blockchain is time-stamped
    and shared with each participant/node, where the participant authenticates and
    validates the transaction. Only one block can be created simultaneously, as the
    proof of work (PoW) has been calculated by node and verified by other participants.
    Once a new block has been created in the chain, it cannot be altered or mutable,
    making the system tamperproof [[1](#CR1)]. The nature of blockchain technology
    makes it much more secure and reliable than centralized platforms. Consumer’s
    data can be tokenized, and buyers can agree to provide their personal information
    anonymously in a distributed ledger, where firms can “purchase” them without the
    need for middlemen or centralized systems [[55](#CR55)]. Identity applications
    of blockchain applied to industry 4.0 can assist in validating reviews and increasing
    their credibility for both businesses and buyers [[6](#CR6)]. At the same time,
    customers can be compensated with tokens for their commitments, creating incentives
    for generating reliable user content, particularly for influencers in digital
    marketing [[36](#CR36)].

  zh: 本节将审查区块链技术在数字营销中的影响。区块链是一种分散化和分布式分类帐，它基于加密算法和点对点（P2P）网络运作[[51](#CR51)]。存储在区块链中的信息是网络安全的，不可篡改或删除[[3](#CR3)]。区块链中的每一笔交易都有时间戳，并与每个参与者/节点共享，参与者对交易进行认证和验证。由于工作量证明（PoW）已由节点计算并由其他参与者验证，因此同时只能创建一个区块。一旦在链中创建了新的区块，它就无法更改或可变，从而使系统防篡改[[1](#CR1)]。区块链技术的性质使其比集中式平台更安全可靠。消费者的数据可以被标记化，买家可以匿名同意在分布式分类帐中提供其个人信息，企业可以“购买”这些信息，无需中间商或集中式系统[[55](#CR55)]。将区块链的身份应用于工业4.0可以帮助验证评论并增加其对企业和买家的可信度[[6](#CR6)]。同时，客户可以因其承诺而获得代币补偿，从而为生成可靠的用户内容创造激励，特别是对于数字营销中的影响者[[36](#CR36)]。
- en: Online marketing is a vital stakeholder of the Internet’s economy [[7](#CR7)].
    Digital marketing can be influenced by blockchain in many ways and also enables
    companies to perceive and utilize accurate information to deliver their services
    [[46](#CR46)]. The distributed ledger of blockchain appends all transactions conducted
    on a public platform that makes it cybersecure and makes fraud detection easy
    [[46](#CR46)]. In digital marketing, the adoption of blockchain technology is
    lagging as compared to other fields [[18](#CR18)]. Several aspects like brand
    communication, transparency of brand to consumers, marketing performance, and
    design of online marketing campaigns are impacted by adopting blockchain technology.
    However, the transactions on the blockchain are entirely private and transparent
    because verification of transactions is done by consensus algorithms and peers
    in the blockchain network [[4](#CR4)]. Contributors and participants of digital
    marketing networks at various levels must participate in the blockchain network
    for it to be successful. Furthermore, the authentication process in a private
    blockchain is performed by the shared/private keys, so therein is a threat to
    security and authentication if the shared/private key is lost or hacked.

    The immutability of each transaction is a key feature of blockchain technology
    [[49](#CR49)]. Trust and transparency are the most valuable features of blockchain
    technology because the level of transparency can be adjusted through cryptographic
    algorithms [[44](#CR44)]. It empowers trust and transparency in digital marketing
    [[49](#CR49)]. No single entity has full control over transactions. The decentralized
    nature of blockchain means that the user can trust the data––a feature that is
    crucial for some business models and marketing activities [[44](#CR44)]. In using
    blockchain technology in industry 4.0, truth and trust become embedded in businesses,
    as every interaction with the customer can be traced and will be transparent in
    blockchain-enabled digital marketing [[49](#CR49)]. Dishonest marketing and fraud
    can be controlled as the entire blockchain system is transparent [[22](#CR22)].
    It will force digital marketing companies to tell the complete truth and maintain
    honesty with customers and partners in the business [[22](#CR22)]. The malicious
    marketing of counterfeit products and violation of copyright law and intellectual
    property (IP) rights can be avoided with the help of blockchain technology, as
    the technology facilitates the traceability of end-to-end products.

    can gain better access and information about products and services, the visibility
    of production process is increased, and supply chain activities and delivery route
    can be tracked [[44](#CR44)]. That leads to a transparent interaction with the
    consumer and supplier/brand, enabling companies to gain consumer trust in the
    brand [[17](#CR17)]. The transparency and verification of each process made by
    the marketers can boost the confidence of consumers and will help maintain long-term
    relationships [[17](#CR17)]. A customer can sign the smart contract with the marketer/service
    provider and agree on a specific date and terms. If the marketer does not meet
    the conditions, the smart contract will automatically refund the customer [[17](#CR17)].
    Blockchain has improved transparency with reduced tracking time. Walmart cooperated
    with IBM to trace all steps of products back to the supplier [[17](#CR17)]. Similarly,
    Starbucks collaborated with Microsoft to trace their coffee from bean to cup using
    Azure blockchain [[52](#CR52)]. The next section will explain how Hyperledger
    techniques enable monitoring, searching, and maintaining blockchain developments
    and related data.

- en: Research into blockchain technology enabled its implementation across different
    areas. Some common protocols of blockchain technology include Bitcoin, consensus
    network, Ethereum, Corda, and Hyperledger. It is widely used in the software industry
    because of its potential benefits. Hyperledger is an open-source system for implementing
    permitted blockchains in a modular and extensible form [[50](#CR50)]. The Linux
    Foundation initiated it in 2015 as an open blockchain platform [[50](#CR50)].
    The Hyperledger (Fig. [3](#Fig3)) deploys the distributed applications without
    relying on native cryptocurrency, and it does not support Bitcoin or any other
    cryptocurrency. Still, it works on blockchain technology and tokens via chain
    code [[35](#CR35)]. The Hyperledger is an incubation project under which open-source
    blockchain applications and tools are developed. The key purpose of the Hyperledger
    protocol is to increase the reliability and performance of the ledger [[50](#CR50)].
    To create a collaborative environment for supporting a wide array of components
    of different uses, the Linux Foundation has made efforts to provide a modular
    framework. The goal of Linux is to develop an environment in which different developers
    and companies meet and coordinate to build a blockchain framework [[15](#CR15)].
    Hyperledger has gone through major upgradation with the collaboration of other
    technology players like Microsoft’s COCO, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EAA),
    and Cisco [[40](#CR40)].![](../images/513458_1_En_14_Chapter/513458_1_En_14_Fig3_HTML.png)

    in company operations were enabled by Hyperledger, which was a secure and decentralized
    secret platform for enterprise blockchain solutions [[15](#CR15)]. Hyperledger
    provides a decentralized, immutable blockchain framework coupled with chain codes
    (smart contracts) that guarantee data privacy and facilitate cross-industry coordination
    and engagement [[50](#CR50)]. By allowing for multiple transactions to be executed
    simultaneously, Hyperledger significantly improved data analysis and prediction
    [[38](#CR38)]. Furthermore, in using Hyperledger technology, it became possible
    to create separate channels for total secrecy, and a personal data feature besides
    facilitated authorizations within digital marketing platforms [[38](#CR38)].

    play a critical part in industry 4.0 and simplify digital marketing procedures
    by creating a safe, trustworthy environment [[21](#CR21)]. Blockchain technology
    uses a cryptographic hashing technique to improve security and reliability [[43](#CR43)].
    The members can trust in blockchain networks instead of third parties, as the
    evidence of each transaction is recorded in the hash value of a chain [[37](#CR37)].
    Blockchain enhances the collection and processing of data and makes data more
    valuable [[44](#CR44)]. Blockchain in industry 4.0 will influence big data and
    ultimately digital marketing [[44](#CR44)]. At the same time, the implementation
    of blockchain for industry 4.0 will reduce data, as the consumer has control of
    their data, and marketers are not allowed to access the data without consumer
    consent [[17](#CR17)]. This reduction in data will provide a more holistic understanding
    of the consumer. The data in the blockchain network will be better than the traditional
    network as the users are authenticated and verified [[17](#CR17)]. In Fig. [4](#Fig4),
    the application of blockchain in digital marketing and incorporation of big data
    with blockchain technology have several advantages. The blockchain will increase
    the accuracy and security of data. In addition, the threat of cyberattacks is
    eliminated due to the distributed nature of blockchain technology [[2](#CR2)].
    Data stored in the blockchain is cryptographically signed and immutable, influencing
    companies to operate and communicate in the context of digital marketing and create
    customer-relevant content [[37](#CR37)]. Blockchain technology in industry 4.0
    offers data transparency and data integrity to all participants in the network
    and allows verified nodes to access and operate the blockchain [[44](#CR44)].
    When companies do not provide the relevant information, consumers will block companies
    from processing or accessing their data [[18](#CR18)].![](../images/513458_1_En_14_Chapter/513458_1_En_14_Fig4_HTML.png)

    applications for modular, comprehensive, interoperability, and security features
    [[15](#CR15)]. Hyperledger’s data are protected from the underlying algorithm
    due to asymmetric cryptography and zero-knowledge verification; and the digital
    certificate management service ensures the company’s blockchain authenticity [[15](#CR15)].
    Hyperledger’s multichannel design isolates data across channels where private
    data gathering allows for personal information separation between businesses within
    the same network [[38](#CR38)]. The prominent built-in features of blockchain
    technology are trust, security, and transparency, which resolve marketing issues
    in an effective way [[23](#CR23)]. The integration of blockchain technology in
    digital marketing is still in development, but this review of the literature proved
    that it has enormous potential to improve or even disrupt multiple areas in marketing.

    network node [[36](#CR36)]. Limiting network members’ access to block data helps
    safeguard consumer privacy online, and the network can confirm private transactions
    [[55](#CR55)]. Since blockchain encrypts user credentials (e.g., user IDs, passwords,
    electronic ID cards), customers have more control over their personal information
    [[35](#CR35)]. Blockchain transaction history can assist consumers in understanding
    their preferences. Trust is vital in digital marketing, and without trust, consumer
    faith in business has dwindled [[11](#CR11)]. According to Moşteanu and Faccia
    [[41](#CR41)], technical infrastructure greatly influences trust. Digital marketing
    now facilitates transactions without personal contact, and a business’ success
    hinges on trust and transparency [[28](#CR28)]. With this high degree of transparency,
    marketers can indicate various beneficial characteristics and highlight their
    altruistic purpose to look out for the consumer’s best interests [[48](#CR48)].
    The use of blockchain technologies for Industry 4.0 promotes a transparent market
    environment and ensures that the future quality of marketing is traded fairly
    under guaranteed contracts [[48](#CR48)]. Table [1](#Tab1) summarizes the findings
    of a systematic literature review, which concludes that blockchain technology
    has potential applications in digital marketing. The review also identifies significant
    benefits of implementing blockchain technology in the industry 4.0 era.

    IoT, cloud, AI, automation, and blockchain. In using blockchain technology to
    secure public confidence and manage data, businesses can automate processes and
    reduce the need for physical work. In the coming years, blockchain technology
    will become a critical component of industry 4.0\. Blockchain technology can increase
    security, trust, transparency, confidence, and performance in the digital marketing
    environment, where data is the most important factor in determining the effectiveness
    of digital marketing efforts. Blockchain technology allows the collection of high-quality
    data without putting the data’s integrity at risk. Digital marketing and advertising
    systems powered by blockchain technology establish reliable and secure transactions
    while maintaining confidentiality. The Hyperledger framework supports blockchain
    in overcoming the technological limitations in security, authenticity, integrity,
    efficiency, and accuracy. Blockchain technology in industry 4.0 will keep growing
    with wider applications in business and marketing as it can give a solution for
    existing and emerging marketing problems. This review found that blockchain in
    industry 4.0 can change marketing operations through cryptocurrency, supply chain
    management, and loyalty programs. It is recommended that digital marketing performed
    on the blockchain network reflects the clarity, security, and access to accurate
    information. Blockchain improves digital marketing methods and allows consumers
    to share their information directly with the right seller. The enhanced security,
    traceability, and transparency of blockchain in industry 4.0 can open a new horizon
    in business practices for consumers [[14](#CR14)]. Advertisement strategies can
    also be improved with the blockchain encryption mechanism, as the data is protected
    and privacy rights are maintained, boosting the confidence level of consumers.
    Despite its time and transparency efficiencies, implementing blockchain and managing
    a marketing channel remain challenging. Various areas of digital marketing have
    been explored in this study that can benefit from the implementation of blockchain
    technology. There is no question that blockchain technology should be incorporated
    into digital marketing––the benefits are clear. Although blockchain technology
    has clear benefits and prospects to improve efficiency and save costs, it also
    has significant challenges and constraints that cannot be ignored [[1](#CR1)].
    Future research should investigate precisely how blockchain technology can be
    implemented in digital marketing in a way that mitigates challenges and limitations.
