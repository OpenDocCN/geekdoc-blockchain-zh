    next to the Housatonic River in western Massachusetts, the Future moved in.

    special-effects virtuoso Douglas Trumbull. In a world rapidly going digital, Trumbull
    doggedly stuck to analog techniques. That meant building physical models of everything
    and putting his many-layered images onto high-resolution film.

    produce a theme-park ride based on Robert Zemeckis’s Back to the Future series
    of movies. I invested.

    Rex was looming over our dusty wooden stairwell, an unofficial mascot of Gilder
    Publishing. We never quite took him seriously, though he would become a favorite
    of time-traveling tourists at theme parks in Orlando, Hollywood, and Osaka in
    a reign lasting some sixteen years.

    in the “Star Gate” rebirth sequence at the end of Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film
    2001: A Space Odyssey, he had abandoned Hollywood and exiled himself to a small
    Massachusetts town, where he nursed suspicions of conspiratorial resistance to
    his analog genius. After his triumph in 2001, Trumbull provided special effects
    for several other landmark films, including Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters
    of the Third Kind (1977) and Ridley Scott’s 1982 Blade Runner.'

    early 90s he was attempting rebirth as the inventor of an immersive seventy-millimeter,
    sixty-frames-per-second film process called Showscan and a 3D ride-film. The result
    was an experience we now call “virtual reality.” Trumbull’s analog 3D achieved
    full immersion without 3D glasses or VR goggles. Eat your heart out, Silicon Valley.

    million—was a trivial mind game compared with Trumbull’s ride. Universal’s producer
    Steven Spielberg speculated that the plot of Back to the Future could inspire
    a ride-film that would outdo Disneyland’s Star Tours, created by George Lucas
    and based on his Star Wars movies. Lucas dismissed the possibility of Universal’s
    matching the spectacle of Star Tours.

    the wild-haired, wild-eyed Doctor Brown; the quaint clock-towered town of Hill
    Valley, California; the bully Biff—you recall them perhaps. They time-traveled
    into our three-story brick building, along with the Tyrannosaurus, the shell of
    a DeLorean, and a makeshift theater, for more than a year of filming.

    ride-film, which ended up costing some $40 million. It brought in a multiple of
    that in revenues over more than a decade and a half and saved the Universal theme
    park in Orlando from extinction at the hands of Disney World. It was first screened
    for three of my children and me in the building where we rented our offices. My
    youngest, Nannina, six at the time, was barred from the ride out of fear she would
    be unable to distinguish between the harrowing images and reality.

    the dome of an OmniMax screen, senses saturated, we quickly forgot that the car
    could move only three or four feet in any direction. That was enough to convey
    the illusion of full jet-propelled motion to our beleaguered brains. From the
    moment the lights dropped, we were transported. Chasing “Biff” through time, we
    zoomed out into the model of Hill Valley, shattering the red Texaco sign, zipping
    down the winding streets, crashing into the clock tower on the town hall and through
    it into the Ice Age.

    down an active volcano and over a time cliff into the Cretaceous period. There
    we found ourselves attempting to evade the flashing teeth of the Tyrannosaurus
    rex. We failed, and the DeLorean plunged past the dinosaur’s teeth and into its
    gullet. Mercifully we were vomited out to pursue Biff, bumping into the back of
    his car at the resonant point of eighty-eight miles per hour, as we had been instructed
    to do by Doctor Brown. Shazaam, we plunged back into the present. Oh no!—are we
    going to crash through the panoramic glass window of the Orlando launch facility?
    Yessss! As thousands of shards fell to the floor, we landed back where we had
    started and stepped out of the DeLorean onto the dingy warehouse stage, no broken
    glass anywhere in sight.

    that see the universe as shear matter, ruled by physics and chemistry alone, leave
    no room for human consciousness and creativity. Just as a 3D ride-film transcends
    a 2D movie, other dimensions of experience are transformative and artistically
    real. As Harvard mathematician-philosopher C. S. Peirce explained early in the
    last century, all symbols and their objects, whether in software, language, or
    art, require the mediation of an interpretive mind.[¹](notes.html#pronote-1)

    reality—counter-factuals, analogies, interpretive emotions, flights of thought
    and creativity. The novelist Neal Stephenson, who coined the term metaverse,[²](notes.html#pronote-2)
    and Jaron Lanier, who pioneered “virtual reality,” were right to explore them
    and value them. Without dimensions beyond the flat universe, our lives and visions
    wane and wither.

    essay “Transposition,”[³](notes.html#pronote-3) which posed the question: If you
    lived in a two-dimensional landscape painting, how would you respond to someone
    earnestly telling you that the 2D image was just the faintest reflection of a
    real 3D world? Comfortable in the cave of your 2D mind, you had 2D theories that
    explained all you experienced in flatland—the pigments of paint, the parallax
    relationships of near and far objects, the angles and edges. The math all jibed.
    “Three dimensions?” you might ask. “I have no need for that hypothesis.”'

    to the future. The Internet has not delivered on some of its most important promises.
    In 1990 I was predicting that in the world of networked computers, no one would
    have to see an advertisement he didn’t want to see. Under Google’s guidance, the
    Internet is not only full of unwanted ads but fraught with bots and malware. Instead
    of putting power in the hands of individuals, it has become a porous cloud where
    all the money and power rise to the top.

    devotees uphold the flat-universe theory of materialism: the sufficiency of deterministic
    chemistry and mathematics. They believe the human mind is a suboptimal product
    of random evolutionary processes. They believe in the possibility of a silicon
    brain. They believe that machines can “learn” in a way comparable to human learning,
    that consciousness is a relatively insignificant aspect of humanity, emergent
    from matter, and that imagination of true novelties is a delusion in a hermetic
    world of logic. They hold that human beings have no more to discover and may as
    well retire on a guaranteed pension, while Larry Page and Sergey Brin fly off

    planets in a winner-take-all cosmos.'
