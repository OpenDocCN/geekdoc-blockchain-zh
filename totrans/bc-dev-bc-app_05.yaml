- en: 'Chapter 5: Blockchain SecurityBlockchain is on two sides of the same coin,
    in that it has innovative practices that reinforce existing cybersecurity, but
    just like any other electronic entity, it needs securing of its own.The CIA triad
    is a security model designed to protect information. The three principles are
    Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. It aims to protect an organization’s
    data, devices and networks.The confidentiality principle ensures that all information
    goes undisclosed. This means that only approved users are granted access to view
    and change information.The integrity principle relies on the confidentiality principle
    being functional. As long as information is safe and untainted, integrity remains
    intact.The availability principle ensures that all devices work at full capacity
    so that the relevant parties have access to any and all information whenever they
    need it.Blockchain has taken the CIA triad, implemented and in some instances,
    improved it.In blockchain, we can look at the heavy encryption as adhering to
    the confidentiality aspect. Anything on a computer can be hacked, but the blockchain
    encryption is near impossible to break through. It would take a lot of time and
    energy to penetrate, so the information in the blocks is safe.The verification
    of transactions within the blockchain framework speaks to the integrity principle.
    We can be certain that the information stored has not been interfered with.Blockchain
    Security BasicsThe fact that all the data and functions in the blockchain network
    are not concentrated in one place makes it easier to verify transactions. There
    are multiple computers in a single distributed ledger. For the chain to be compromised,
    one person would have to assume control of at least 60% of those computers.The
    largest blockchain networks allow members of the public access. On the surface
    that may seem like a bad idea, but having so many computers on one network boosts
    security. The more people there are on the network, the easier it is to verify
    transactions. Also, the more computers there are on the network the harder it
    becomes to gain unsanctioned access to any blocks on the chain.Permissioned BlockchainsPermissioned
    Blockchains are private distributed ledgers that can only be accessed with pre-authorization.
    Not all users have far ranging control of all aspects in the blockchain though,
    there are ledger administrators who are in control of the access control layer
    of the ledger. They are also subject to verification checks but are the only people
    who are authorized to grant other users access. They are mainly used by companies
    that have a lot of sensitive information, like banks. Ripple is a permissioned
    blockchain that was developed by the banking industry to cut transaction costs.The
    key characteristics of a permissioned blockchain are:●     There is limited transparency●     There
    is no anonymity● There is also no central authority, but ledger administrators
    can allow or deny access.Advantages of a Permissioned Blockchain:● Provides fixed
    signatures that encrypt all transactions, making them more secure●     All users
    in the network are completely anonymous● Because there are no third parties, there
    isn’t a long waiting period between transactions● Information is not stored in
    a central archive so it''s easily accessible from any location at any timeDisadvantages
    of a Permissioned Blockchain:● The security of a permissioned network relies heavily
    on the integrity of its users● There is an element of censorship, because ledger
    administrators can restrict transactionsPermissionless BlockchainsPermissionless
    Blockchains are open to the public. Anybody with a computer can transact on these.
    All data is stored on several computers around the world and users are pretty
    much anonymous. Most cryptocurrencies use these networks.The key characteristics
    of a permissionless blockchain are:●     Complete transparency on all transactions●     Anonymity●     Operates
    without a central authorityAdvantages of a Permissionless Blockchain:● Less prone
    to cyber attacks. A hacker would have to gain control of at least 51% of the network
    to be able to do any damage● Uncensored. Because there are so many nodes participating
    in the network, there cannot be a central authorityDisadvantages of a Permissionless
    Blockchain:● Even though we’ve praised blockchain networks for being completely
    anonymous, there are some drawbacks. If by chance, somebody was to successfully
    commit fraud, it would be difficult to track them down. Also, people have been
    reported to use the blockchain network for unlawful activities.● Bitcoin relies
    heavily on the PoW system, and while it ensures security, it consumes a lot of
    energy and ends up being quite costly.●     The block size on a permissionless
    blockchain is limited.The Role of Miners in BlockchainMining has really taken
    off since Bitcoin arrived on the scene. Not only do they receive Bitcoin, but
    they add to the blockchain security protocol. Miners task themselves with validating
    all transactions and making sure they adhere to the Bitcoin code. On the Bitcoin
    blockchain, miners present their Proof of Work which signifies why they either
    approve or deny a particular transaction. They get paid in Bitcoin for every transaction
    they successfully validate.How Blockchain Security Averts Double SpendingBlockchain
    developers are cautiously optimistic about the steps they’ve taken to ensure visibility
    and security on different networks. But they are realistic about the fact that
    there is always a slim chance that some things can go unseen. Blockchains could
    fall victim to a double spending attack and a user could spend one unit of cryptocurrency
    a number of times before anything is picked up on the network.On the blockchains
    of the various cryptocurrencies, each network has to reach a consensus on the
    order of a transaction to be able to confirm and share them in full view of the
    entire network.The first ever cryptocurrency to solve the double spending problem
    was Bitcoin. Whenever a user would try and spend the same coin twice by sending
    it to two other users at the same time, both transactions would end up in a store
    for unconfirmed transactions. The first payment would be added to the coin’s chain
    as a block. The second transaction wouldn’t fit on the chain because it would
    be connected to the first and then the transaction would fail completely.Blockchain
    Security RisksBlockchain is a pretty solid technology but it has its vulnerabilities.
    Even though it’s difficult, there are a few ways Hackers could compromise the
    system. These are some of the ways:● Because the blockchain is decentralized there’s
    a ton of information traveling through cyberspace. A talented hacker could gain
    access to data while it’s on its way to the Internet Service Provider. Unfortunately
    there is no alert for this, so attacks like this can go unnoticed.● Wide-reaching
    public blockchains rely on a large number of computers for the purpose of mining.
    If a group of miners were to get together, they would have enough computing power
    to take over 50% of the network’s mining capacity. This is called a 51% attack.●
    Hackers can create an inordinate amount of false identities and crash a specific
    blockchain network. These are called Sybil attacks.● An age-old practice for hackers
    is phishing. Unfortunately blockchain isn’t immune. Hackers send well designed
    and constructed false emails requesting the login credentials of cryptocurrency
    wallet holders.● The lack of human involvement was originally what sold a lot
    of people on Blockchains, but now it’s receiving some mild criticism. People have
    cited the anonymity that the network allows as being the reason why it is used
    by unsavory characters like terrorist groups. It is said that they make use of
    blockchains and cryptocurrency to launder their money thus eluding banks and the
    long arm of the law.● As previously stated, blockchains need a ton of power to
    operate. According to Morgan Stanley, the bitcoin network consumes the same amount
    of energy as 2 million homes in the United States. The mining, which is a huge
    part of the model, is responsible for a lot of that consumption. The worst case
    scenario would be that the price of coins decreases and the price of electricity
    increases. This would see the number of miner’s decreasing heavily.Blockchain
    Security in PracticeWhile there is a standard for how a blockchain is supposed
    to operate, not all blockchains are exactly the same. Some companies have amended
    their security measures, either to save on costs or to cater to their specific
    security needs.Here are six examples:●     MobilecoinMobilecoin is a cryptocurrency
    company located in California. They are generating a safe and easy to use cryptocurrency
    for companies that can’t afford to implement ledger security procedures on their
    own. Mobilecoin replaces transaction service providers by keeping transaction
    information encrypted on both sides. Mobilecoin works with WhatsApp and Facebook
    Messenger.●     CoinbaseCoinbase, also based in California is a company that facilitates
    the acquiring and exchange of most, if not all cryptocurrencies. Every customer
    gets a digital wallet with a password. Coinbase relies solely on encryption and
    every employee is subject to exhaustive background checks to ensure the safety
    of their customers’ cryptocurrency.●     J.P. MorganJ.P. Morgan is a well-known
    financial institution in the United States. They have developed a version of Ethereum
    called Quorum. It caters to the specific needs of enterprises and uses blockchain
    technology to execute private transactions. They make use of Smart contracts on
    their network to ensure transparency and accuracy on all transactions.●     Lockheed
    MartinLockheed Martin is a defense contractor. A defense contractor is an entity
    that has an agreement with the United States to produce arms or take up arms for
    the national defense force. It is the first defense contractor to make use of
    blockchain security. They are collaborating with Guardtime federal to implement
    blockchain protocols in their software development, supply chain processes and
    engineering systems. They are using a blockchain network to keep track of their
    arms development systems.●     CiscoCisco is one of the largest tech companies,
    also located in California. They proposed the idea that blockchain complements
    the Internet of Things because there are no single points of failure and important
    information can be protected by encryption. If the Internet of Things adopts blockchain
    as it’s preferred network, it could see a spike in Blockchain’s profile.●     Hashed
    HealthHashed Health is a healthcare innovation firm located in Tennessee. They
    want to spearhead the movement to get the healthcare industry to make use of blockchain
    technology. Hashed Health has various subsidiaries and each one of them utilizes
    different facets of blockchain. They have already worked with a number of hospitals
    and facilitated the building of various blockchain networks that store and give
    access to patient information.'
