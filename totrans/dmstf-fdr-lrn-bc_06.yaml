    agriculture to be of critical importance. The fast growth of networking has resulted
    in IoT-based farm management systems. Increased agricultural activity is intended
    as intelligent agriculture or precision agriculture to be of critical importance.
    The established cloud-based platforms cannot cope with the huge quotas and diverse
    data provided by the connected IoT devices, which are based on conventional cloud
    models. It is important to get data processing closer to the origins of their
    output to reduce lag in aiding real-time decision-making based on the data generated.
    The adoption of fog-based models will solve this and will be discussed in this
    chapter. To ensure optimum bandwidth usage and low latency for real-time decision-making,
    an IoT-Fog farm management system may be more capable.

- en: In Fog Computing, the data, computer, store, and applications are situated anywhere
    between the data source and the cloud, which is a decentralized computing infrastructure
    (Whig et al., 2022). Fog computing, like edge computing, brings the cloud's benefits
    and power closer to where data is produced and acted upon. Because both entail
    moving intelligence and processing closer to where the data is produced, the phrases
    fog computing and edge computing are sometimes used interchangeably. This is frequently
    done to increase productivity, but it might also be done for security or compliance
    concerns (Anand et al., 2022).

    and used. In other words, more people may remain on the internet simultaneously

    with additional safety and compliance.

    and computing systems as close as feasible to the applications, components, and
    devices that require them. This is especially essential for devices connected

    both in fog and mobile edge computing, while processing data in somewhat different
    places. Cutting edges generally occur when sensors are connected to equipment
    and where data collection takes place—there is a physical link between data source
    and place of processing. Fog computing closes the distance between the processing
    site and the data source, but does so by carrying out edge computing activity
    with, or within, the LAN processors linked to, an IoT or fog node (Whig & Ahmad,
    2019). This results in a physically more distant processing distance from the
    sensors, but no further delay (verma, 2019).

    just like ag robots. To process the collections and decider regular activities,
    e.g., watering plants, feeding cattle, temperature management, lights, humidity
    in a room, etc., the closed ecosystem can therefore handle itself without relying
    on a remote server Figure 7 shows automation in agriculture.

- en: Edge computing, as with robots, enables the farms or greenhouses to function
    independent of the main server link and take local choices based on local sensor
    data. This has the potential to increase the dependability of the operations and
    minimize the waste production processes of agriculture (Arun Velu, 2021; Whig,
    2019b).

    or the environment to forecast future disasters and, if specific indicators of
    danger are detected, instantly inform the general control center. As a result,
    farmers will be able to take early precautions to safeguard their crops, at least
    partially, in the event of a wildfire, Figure 8 shows protecting crops using Bots
    (Sharma et al. 2022; Rajawat et al. 2022).
