- en: This chapter critically evaluates the way in which the existing United Kingdom
    (UK) construction payment regime will function with—and assist—payment mechanisms
    which utilise smart contracts. Blockchain is one of several new developments in
    the increasingly technologically developing UK construction industry. Whilst the
    law translates real-world actions into legal obligations to pay and then assists
    in turning those obligations into payment, the blockchain with smart contract mechanisms
    will automate that process, providing security and removing any intermediation
    which could stop or slow the process down illegitimately. Coupled with the use
    of smart contracts, therefore, blockchain technology has the potential to facilitate
    a solution to the payment and cash flow issues in the UK construction industry.
    To achieve the added functionality described and thereby make it a useful tool
    for payment in construction, however, these developments would need to coexist
    with the existing legal framework. There are important points in the detail that
    should be more fully understood by users of the blockchain/smart contract systems,
    and which are explored in this chapter.

- en: For lawyers, blockchain technology represents an opportunity—but it remains
    somewhat unknown (see e.g., Low and Mik [[11](#CR11)]). For the construction industry,
    the practice of combining human ingenuity and technology has a long history. The
    desire to achieve efficiency in the industry has led to a call to embrace recent
    and emerging technological developments. Blockchain is the latest of these. The
    UK Government’s recent guidance on sourcing and contracting public works, projects
    and programme (the Construction Playbook) published in December 2020 has a whole
    chapter addressing modern methods of construction. A recent report by McKinsey
    and Co identifies several areas of construction technology ripe for growth in
    the industry [[14](#CR14)]. These include BIM and Electronic management, robotics
    and technology infrastructure (such as wireless connectivity, construction drones,
    electric vehicle docking areas, etc.). These opportunities provide ways to gather,
    assess and present the information at the core of construction management. Nevertheless,
    longstanding issues remain; in particular, the problem of cash flow.

    or deduction at the time payment is due.

- en: It is therefore helpful to explore how the regime imposed by law will interact
    with a smart contract that facilitates payment. Whilst ‘strict application’ is
    required, this does not necessarily mean that the system is rigid. A more general
    observation of the white paper is that it takes a very cautious approach to what
    could be achieved by deploying blockchain technology with a smart contract to
    aid the payment process, soon. This hesitation can be gleaned from the description
    of what is possible in the short term—automation of interparty payments, acceleration
    of payment and automation of the accounting process—and what is not. There is
    a sense in which this perspective of the white paper is connected to the very
    definition of ‘smart contracts’ adopted ([[3](#CR3)], p. 17).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we take the view that both at this nascent stage of development
    or in future, the ‘smart contract’ will likely have legal implications for the
    parties involved in construction transactions and therefore should be conceptualised
    as such. Conceiving the ‘smart contract’ as more than just an ‘application’ (see
    [[3](#CR3)], p. 17), will allow for a discussion of content and how that is ‘translated’
    into computer codes for the purposes of the operation of the smart contract.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is scope for scepticism about the application of legal rules and indeed
    much of the discussion of smart contracts has, rightfully, focussed on the revolutionary
    possibilities of the decentralised nature of the information held. However, there
    is a key distinction relevant to construction where—if the smart contract (or
    system of smart contracts) operates as it should—then there is a mark and impact
    on the physical world. No matter how distributed and decentralised the activity
    on the blockchain is, the outcome will end up in one actual place where the construction
    has happened. The legal framework therefore provides some certainty to the sort
    of questions that lawyers will set out to their clients to quantify and manage
    risk.

- en: One of the challenges of implementation in smart contracts is the so-called
    ‘oracle problem’ where the quality of the inputs into the blockchain from the
    outside world drive the acceptability of the outputs generated through the smart
    contract process ([[11](#CR11)], p. 26), “garbage in/garbage out” being the axiom
    (see e.g., the discussion with industry in Mason ([[13](#CR13)] p. 16). That is
    also significant in terms of the process of changing work done into an obligation
    to pay, and then into actual payment. The UK payment legislation discussed below
    can help in understanding that process.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using payment legislation, relevant case law and academic literature, a legal
    doctrinal research approach is used to critically examine the extent to which
    the combination of smart contract and blockchain technologies on one hand and
    the existing statutory payment system in the UK construction industry on the other
    can facilitate and indeed address some of the bottlenecks around that process.
    The basic tenets of this methodology have been described in detail elsewhere [[12](#CR12)].
    Also identified are ways in which the legal framework is relevant to the payment
    issues in construction contracts—both in terms of how it might create obligatory
    force and in terms of the sort of issues that might need to be determined in setting
    up the contract.

- en: The chapter begins by identifying the emerging legal context of smart contracts
    and related issues. From this legal perspective, discussions around the introduction
    of new technologies such as smart contracts will involve what they are, the extent
    to which such technologies will comply, or indeed conform to, the existing legal
    framework or operate around it. Then there is the question of how the use of the
    technology will interact with various aspects of the law. The origins and the
    importance of the underlying policy surrounding the legal framework for payment
    in the UK are identified. The relevance of this approach is to underscore the
    need to maintain the logic underpinning the legal policy even when the ‘form’
    of the payment arrangement is facilitated by technology. Finally, the chapter
    attempts to examine how the current legal framework would apply to the processes
    and operation of a smart contract for payment in a construction contract (as at
    the time of writing in 2021). This will focus on how the framework would apply
    to smart contract payment mechanisms for work done and highlight possible issues
    which the use of the technology might give rise to.

    to self-execute agreements when certain agreed conditions are met [[4](#CR4)])
    have made these technologies potentially effective substitutes for interventions
    by human experts. The idea of the smart contract is viewed differently by different
    people. Three dominant views are gleanable from the literature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first set of definitions conceptualise smart contracts by their form and
    function. An example of this category of definitions is seen on page 17 of the
    CBC Whitepaper. Citing the Ethereum Foundation [[5](#CR5)]. The report describes
    smart contracts as ‘applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility
    of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference’. Missing from this
    definition is any reference to a contract. This definition, like others in the
    same category, emphasises the form of the concept (computer programme, application,
    computer code, etc.), the absence of human intervention and the self-executing
    elements of smart contracts. The input is often viewed as a set of instructions,
    and conditions; not necessarily as something legal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second set of definitions leaves readers with no doubt that the smart contract
    is a legal instrument. The English Law Commission’s perspective falls under this
    category. It defines smart contract as ‘a legally binding contract in which some
    or all of the contractual obligations are recorded in or performed automatically
    by a computer programme deployed on a distributed ledger’ [[10](#CR10)]. This
    definition, like many others, highlights the legally binding nature of smart contracts
    and the contractual obligations they embody [[17](#CR17)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are other definitions that straddle the two categories of definitions
    described above. Temte [[18](#CR18)] defines smart contracts as “a set of promises,
    specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform
    on these promises.” Ng defines smart contracts as self-executing contracts the
    terms of which are directly written into a line of code [[15](#CR15)].^([1](#Fn1))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last set of definitions highlights the nature, creation (reducing the terms
    into a computer code) and the execution of the contract [[19](#CR19)]. Ng’s definition
    notes that once terms are incorporated into lines of code, the terms of the contract
    are automatically executed by computer transaction protocols based on conditions
    agreed by consensus and incorporated into the computer programme. These are referred
    to as “oracles,” mutually agreed real-time data providers used to confirm triggering
    events [[2](#CR2)].^([2](#Fn2)) There is a need for agreement on what these oracles
    will be since one of the key parts ensuring  the smart contract’s credible operation
    is an agreement (a contract) between those who are using it. It is the mutual
    agreement that gives force to the oracle—taking the ‘real world’ information ‘into’
    the smart contract operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The implication of the above views on the smart contract is significant. Those
    of the view that smart contracts are not necessarily equivalent to legal contracts
    tend to play down discussions about the validity or otherwise of smart contracts
    within the context of the legal system. That way, the argument as to the legal
    status of the contracts is reduced to general compliance with the wider legal
    framework and not the legal status of the terms themselves. In this chapter, it
    is argued that given the role that smart contracts may play in the short and medium
    term in the construction industry, it is vital that they are conceptualised from
    the onset as legal agreements to allow for a thorough examination of their legal
    status. This will also encourage conversation around how *legal* language in the
    form of a contract in a *natural* language may be translated into a computer code language.

    CBC white paper. It is not proposed to reiterate that here beyond setting out
    the necessary information for what follows:   the origin and reasons for the legal
    framework for construction payment in the UK are important in understanding how
    it might operate on or alongside a smart contract.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The need for reform to promote cash flow was recognised by Sir  Michael Latham
    [[9](#CR9)] and others who produced several reports on the state of the UK construction
    industry in the early to mid-1990s. These reports were produced as joint efforts
    of the industry and government. At the core of the problems underlying, the industry
    was said to be an adversarial culture. This exacerbated structural problems where
    lack of cash flow was a major issue in the industry (although that diagnosis goes
    back decades with the phrase ‘cashflow is the lifeblood of the industry’ being
    immortalised in construction law by Lord Denning in the early 1970s.^([3](#Fn3)))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    culminating in the passing of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration
    Act 1996, later amended by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction
    Act 2009\. Part II of the 1996 Act (as amended) responded directly to the two
    key challenges facing the industry, namely costly dispute resolution and cashflow
    problems. The first saw the emergence of the process of construction adjudication,
    which has now become the primary means of speedy resolution of construction disputes
    in the UK. The second set of rules established a statutory payment system. This
    essentially set the standard for payment for construction works falling under
    the Act and also provides default rules—the Scheme for Construction Contracts^([4](#Fn4))—which
    apply in situations where the parties fail to agree on a payment arrangement that
    is compliant with the Act. The Act sets the scope of its application by defining
    ‘construction contracts’ and ‘construction operations’ and specifically excludes
    certain types of contracts from its purview (Sections. 104–106).

    payments for works that take over 45 days (Section 109). The literature tends
    to emphasise instalment payments specifically, but it is clear from the language
    of the Act, as applied, that the law envisages a flexible system where parties
    can agree different periodic payment arrangements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Section 109(2) provides that the parties are free to agree: (i) the amounts
    of the payments; (ii) the intervals at which they become due and (iii) the circumstances
    in which they become due. The start of the payment period is marked by an established
    ‘due date.’ This sets a baseline of 5 days for the provision of a notice by the
    payer of what is considered due. If the payer fails to do so, then there is a
    provision that an earlier application for payment by the payee can stand in its
    stead. There is then an obligation on the payee to pay the sum in the payment
    notice by the final date for payment (contractually agreed) unless they serve
    a further notice within a time from that final date.'

    but it must be an ‘adequate mechanism’.^([5](#Fn5)) The Act provides for a further
    consequence of non-payment, which is allowing for the suspension of works by the
    contractor if they are not paid. The Act also provides that if the relevant notices
    are not served then payment of the amounts set out in the notices should be made.^([6](#Fn6))
    This means that if a payer does not engage in the process, they suffer the consequence
    of having to pay a sum claimed, even if it is not an accurate reflection of the
    work done (and then having to undertake further proceedings to correct any inaccuracies,
    without the benefit of holding onto the cash).

    agree to be bound by the law of any jurisdiction—and to cherry-pick particular
    legal rules for particular contractual issues. Indeed, since smart contracts can
    provide significant gains in contract management and efficiency, they may even
    facilitate this sort of segmentation (different rules for different parts of an
    arrangement) in the future. In theory, therefore, what is to prevent parties from
    simply disapplying of the Act by agreeing that their contract and smart contract
    will be governed by the law of another jurisdiction?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In answering this question, the starting point is whether (or in what circumstances)
    the 1996 Act is at all relevant for governing smart contracts (as envisaged here).
    The legal answer is clear. It is the parties cannot decide that the Act does not
    apply by agreeing that a contract should be bound by the laws of a different legal
    system. In *Motacus Constructions Ltd v Paolo Castelli SpA*,^([10](#Fn10)) there
    was an argument about whether the Act applied to a contract for construction works
    in England, but under a contract that was said to be governed by the law of France.
    In reaching their decision, the court was keen to ensure that the policy of ensuring
    a quick adjudication decision and the ensuing cash flow could not be thwarted
    by a party simply agreeing to contract under the law of a different jurisdiction.
    It is suggested that the reasoning on that point would apply equally to the payment
    provisions (although there are some interesting questions around how valuation
    might work in different jurisdictions). The courts held that the Act governed
    ‘construction operations’ in the UK. They noted that the legislation is itself
    clear that the scope of the Act is over *all* works in the UK—not just those which
    have an agreement to be governed by the law of one of the UK jurisdictions (see
    Section 107(4) of the Act). Rather than looking at the abstract agreement of the
    parties as to the ‘location’ of the contract, the court looked at where the work
    was actually being done. That real-world impact was in the UK and so it was the
    UK framework that applied.

    project needs to be about the creation of a physical thing and that will be in
    a physical place. The process of creation will also have to happen in that place

    the length of time in which that is to happen). Without getting too metaphysical
    and conceptual on the way in which laws apply, the country or region which governs
    the site where the project is being built will have an interest in it. The general
    laws of that state will apply to that building and the people who are working
    there. The question is how the particular features of the more complex regime

    and freedom of contract.

    by a smart contract will necessarily be caught, but some will. Payment for *design*
    work (which falls within the definition of ‘construction operations’ in the Act) can
    happen without being in any particular ‘place’ and so poses a particular test
    for the application of the Act. For payment, there is a significant issue that
    payment or value can be automatically transferred anywhere (or indeed to some
    sort of conception of ‘nowhere’) and more generally, the generation of intellectual
    property, such as design can occur virtually anywhere (although then the question
    becomes one of how it is protected—an issue for others to consider).

    the process works, in favour of what is referred to as ‘rough justice’^([16](#Fn16))
    and a spirit that the ethos of the Act is to get parties to ‘pay now, argue later’.^([17](#Fn17))
    The need for cash flow is paramount. While many of the discussions have focused
    specifically on the adjudication process (the ‘argue later’ part of the equation);
    the ‘pay now’ part is integral to the conception of the law. This means that even

    smart contracts if that has led to segmentation of tasks into smaller components. It

    However, the courts are likely to look at the arrangement as a whole to see what
    is being done and achieved. It would be analogous to the existing approach taken
    for framework agreements. In that case, each ‘call off’ is treated as a separate
    contract. It might be that a similar approach is taken for the sort of use of
    smart contracts envisaged—each segment of work is treated differently. That might

    has consequences. By way of example, it is entirely possible for the parties who
    intend to use the blockchain and smart contract to facilitate payment to incorporate
    a process that incentivises early or timely payment. This could be in the form
    of a built-in discount system that rewards a conscientious payer and discourages
    any behaviour that frustrates the smooth running of the automated payment system.
    In other words, there could be further research into how smart contracts and blockchains
    could drive an incentive system that promotes desired behaviour and entrenches
    trust. Another example would be the use of the smart contract to adjust the payment
    process to make timely payment a default position provided agreed criteria are
    met and against which non-payment is to be justified rather than payment actively
