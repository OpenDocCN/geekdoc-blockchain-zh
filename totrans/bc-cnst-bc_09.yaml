  zh: 摘要
- en: This chapter critically evaluates the way in which the existing United Kingdom
    (UK) construction payment regime will function with—and assist—payment mechanisms
    which utilise smart contracts. Blockchain is one of several new developments in
    the increasingly technologically developing UK construction industry. Whilst the
    law translates real-world actions into legal obligations to pay and then assists
    in turning those obligations into payment, the blockchain with smart contract mechanisms
    will automate that process, providing security and removing any intermediation
    which could stop or slow the process down illegitimately. Coupled with the use
    of smart contracts, therefore, blockchain technology has the potential to facilitate
    a solution to the payment and cash flow issues in the UK construction industry.
    To achieve the added functionality described and thereby make it a useful tool
    for payment in construction, however, these developments would need to coexist
    with the existing legal framework. There are important points in the detail that
    should be more fully understood by users of the blockchain/smart contract systems,
    and which are explored in this chapter.

  zh: 1 引言
- en: For lawyers, blockchain technology represents an opportunity—but it remains
    somewhat unknown (see e.g., Low and Mik [[11](#CR11)]). For the construction industry,
    the practice of combining human ingenuity and technology has a long history. The
    desire to achieve efficiency in the industry has led to a call to embrace recent
    and emerging technological developments. Blockchain is the latest of these. The
    UK Government’s recent guidance on sourcing and contracting public works, projects
    and programme (the Construction Playbook) published in December 2020 has a whole
    chapter addressing modern methods of construction. A recent report by McKinsey
    and Co identifies several areas of construction technology ripe for growth in
    the industry [[14](#CR14)]. These include BIM and Electronic management, robotics
    and technology infrastructure (such as wireless connectivity, construction drones,
    electric vehicle docking areas, etc.). These opportunities provide ways to gather,
    assess and present the information at the core of construction management. Nevertheless,
    longstanding issues remain; in particular, the problem of cash flow.

  zh: 对于律师来说，区块链技术代表着一个机会，但它仍然是未知的（参见例如，Low和Mik[[11](#CR11)]）。对于建筑行业来说，人类聪明才智和技术相结合的实践历史悠久。在业内追求效率的愿望引发了对最近以及新兴技术发展的呼吁。区块链就是其中最新的技术之一。英国政府于2020年12月发表的《采购和承包公共工程、项目和计划指南》（建筑手册）中有一整章专门阐述了现代建筑方法。麦肯锡和公司最近的一份报告指出了行业中有待增长的几个建筑技术领域[[14](#CR14)]。其中包括BIM和电子管理、机器人技术和技术基础设施（例如无线连接、建筑无人机、电动车停靠区等）。这些机会为收集、评估和展示建筑管理的核心信息提供了途径。尽管如此，长期存在的问题仍然存在；特别是现金流的问题。
- en: 'The problem of facilitating cash flow has been in the industry for decades
    and it is rightly the focus of work done by the Construction Blockchain Consortium
    to see how technology can facilitate it [[3](#CR3)]. The interaction of that technology
    with the legislative solution is identified within the CBC white paper on construction
    cash flow. The white paper concludes at para 4.4.1 on this point that:'

- en: Strict application of legal concepts will prevent, or at least reduce, improper
    implementation and inadequate execution of those concepts and process failures,
    e.g., failure to issue pay less notices on time will prevent inappropriate withholding
    or deduction at the time payment is due.

  zh: 严格执行法律概念将防止，或至少减少，不当实施和不充分执行这些概念和过程失败，例如，未能按时发布少款通知将阻止在支付到期时进行不当扣款或扣除。
- en: It is therefore helpful to explore how the regime imposed by law will interact
    with a smart contract that facilitates payment. Whilst ‘strict application’ is
    required, this does not necessarily mean that the system is rigid. A more general
    observation of the white paper is that it takes a very cautious approach to what
    could be achieved by deploying blockchain technology with a smart contract to
    aid the payment process, soon. This hesitation can be gleaned from the description
    of what is possible in the short term—automation of interparty payments, acceleration
    of payment and automation of the accounting process—and what is not. There is
    a sense in which this perspective of the white paper is connected to the very
    definition of ‘smart contracts’ adopted ([[3](#CR3)], p. 17).

  zh: 因此，探究法律强加的制度将如何与促进支付的智能合约互动是有用的。虽然需要“严格执行”，但这并不一定意味着体系是死板的。白皮书的一个更一般的观点是，它对使用区块链技术与智能合约来辅助支付过程的可能性持非常谨慎的态度。这种犹豫可以从近期可以实现的功能的描述中体现出来——自动处理党间支付、加速支付和自动化会计流程——以及不可能实现的功能。可以说，这个白皮书的观点与所adopt的“智能合约”定义紧密相连([[3](#CR3)],
    p. 17)。
- en: In this chapter, we take the view that both at this nascent stage of development
    or in future, the ‘smart contract’ will likely have legal implications for the
    parties involved in construction transactions and therefore should be conceptualised
    as such. Conceiving the ‘smart contract’ as more than just an ‘application’ (see
    [[3](#CR3)], p. 17), will allow for a discussion of content and how that is ‘translated’
    into computer codes for the purposes of the operation of the smart contract.

  zh: 在本章中，我们认为在当前发展的早期阶段或将来，‘智能合同’可能会对参与建筑交易的各方产生法律影响，因此应该以这种方式来构想。将‘智能合同’视为不仅仅是一个‘应用程序’（见[[3](#CR3)],
    p. 17），将允许讨论其内容以及如何将其‘转化’为计算机代码，以实现智能合同的运作。
- en: There is scope for scepticism about the application of legal rules and indeed
    much of the discussion of smart contracts has, rightfully, focussed on the revolutionary
    possibilities of the decentralised nature of the information held. However, there
    is a key distinction relevant to construction where—if the smart contract (or
    system of smart contracts) operates as it should—then there is a mark and impact
    on the physical world. No matter how distributed and decentralised the activity
    on the blockchain is, the outcome will end up in one actual place where the construction
    has happened. The legal framework therefore provides some certainty to the sort
    of questions that lawyers will set out to their clients to quantify and manage
    risk.

  zh: 人们对法律规则的应用可能持怀疑态度，确实许多对智能合同的讨论都合理地集中在信息分布式本质所带来的革命性可能性上。然而，在涉及建筑的领域，有一个关键区别，即如果智能合同（或智能合同系统）正常运作，那么就会对现实世界产生影响。无论区块链上的活动分布和分散程度如何，最终结果都将出现在建筑已经发生的一个实际地点。因此，法律框架对律师与他们的客户意图量化和管理风险的问题提供了一定的确定性。
- en: One of the challenges of implementation in smart contracts is the so-called
    ‘oracle problem’ where the quality of the inputs into the blockchain from the
    outside world drive the acceptability of the outputs generated through the smart
    contract process ([[11](#CR11)], p. 26), “garbage in/garbage out” being the axiom
    (see e.g., the discussion with industry in Mason ([[13](#CR13)] p. 16). That is
    also significant in terms of the process of changing work done into an obligation
    to pay, and then into actual payment. The UK payment legislation discussed below
    can help in understanding that process.

  zh: 2 方法论
- en: Using payment legislation, relevant case law and academic literature, a legal
    doctrinal research approach is used to critically examine the extent to which
    the combination of smart contract and blockchain technologies on one hand and
    the existing statutory payment system in the UK construction industry on the other
    can facilitate and indeed address some of the bottlenecks around that process.
    The basic tenets of this methodology have been described in detail elsewhere [[12](#CR12)].
    Also identified are ways in which the legal framework is relevant to the payment
    issues in construction contracts—both in terms of how it might create obligatory
    force and in terms of the sort of issues that might need to be determined in setting
    up the contract.

- en: The chapter begins by identifying the emerging legal context of smart contracts
    and related issues. From this legal perspective, discussions around the introduction
    of new technologies such as smart contracts will involve what they are, the extent
    to which such technologies will comply, or indeed conform to, the existing legal
    framework or operate around it. Then there is the question of how the use of the
    technology will interact with various aspects of the law. The origins and the
    importance of the underlying policy surrounding the legal framework for payment
    in the UK are identified. The relevance of this approach is to underscore the
    need to maintain the logic underpinning the legal policy even when the ‘form’
    of the payment arrangement is facilitated by technology. Finally, the chapter
    attempts to examine how the current legal framework would apply to the processes
    and operation of a smart contract for payment in a construction contract (as at
    the time of writing in 2021). This will focus on how the framework would apply
    to smart contract payment mechanisms for work done and highlight possible issues
    which the use of the technology might give rise to.

    我们确定了英国支付法律框架基础政策的起源和重要性。 这种方法的相关性在于强调即使在技术促成“形式”支付安排的情况下，也有必要保持支持法律政策的逻辑。 最后，本章尝试审查当前法律框架如何适用于建筑合同中的智能合同的流程和运作（截至2021年撰写本文时）。

    从文献中可以得出三种主导观点。
- en: The first set of definitions conceptualise smart contracts by their form and
    function. An example of this category of definitions is seen on page 17 of the
    CBC Whitepaper. Citing the Ethereum Foundation [[5](#CR5)]. The report describes
    smart contracts as ‘applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility
    of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference’. Missing from this
    definition is any reference to a contract. This definition, like others in the
    same category, emphasises the form of the concept (computer programme, application,
    computer code, etc.), the absence of human intervention and the self-executing
    elements of smart contracts. The input is often viewed as a set of instructions,
    and conditions; not necessarily as something legal.

  zh: 第一组定义通过其形式和功能对智能合同进行概念化。 此类定义的示例可以在CBC白皮书的第17页上看到。 援引以太坊基金会[[5](#CR5)]。 报告将智能合同描述为“按照程序精确运行的应用，没有任何停机、审查、欺诈或第三方干预的可能性”。
    这个定义中没有任何对合同的提及。 这个定义和同一类别中的其他定义一样，强调了概念的形式（计算机程序、应用程序、计算机代码等）、人类干预的缺失以及智能合同的自动执行要素。
    输入通常被视为一组指令和条件；并不一定是法律上的事物。
- en: The second set of definitions leaves readers with no doubt that the smart contract
    is a legal instrument. The English Law Commission’s perspective falls under this
    category. It defines smart contract as ‘a legally binding contract in which some
    or all of the contractual obligations are recorded in or performed automatically
    by a computer programme deployed on a distributed ledger’ [[10](#CR10)]. This
    definition, like many others, highlights the legally binding nature of smart contracts
    and the contractual obligations they embody [[17](#CR17)].

  zh: 第二组定义让读者毫无疑问，智能合同是一种法律工具。 英国法律委员会的观点属于这一类。它将智能合同定义为“在分布式分类账上部署的计算机程序记录或自动执行某些或所有合同义务的法律约束力合同”[[10](#CR10)]。
    像许多其他定义一样，这个定义强调了智能合同的法律约束力以及它们体现的合同义务[[17](#CR17)]。
- en: There are other definitions that straddle the two categories of definitions
    described above. Temte [[18](#CR18)] defines smart contracts as “a set of promises,
    specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform
    on these promises.” Ng defines smart contracts as self-executing contracts the
    terms of which are directly written into a line of code [[15](#CR15)].^([1](#Fn1))
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 还有一些定义跨越了上述两类定义的界限。Temte将智能合同定义为“以数字形式指定的一系列承诺，包括在这些承诺上当事人执行的协议”。Ng将智能合同定义为直接写入代码行的自执行合同条款[[15](#CR15)]。^([1](#Fn1))
- en: The last set of definitions highlights the nature, creation (reducing the terms
    into a computer code) and the execution of the contract [[19](#CR19)]. Ng’s definition
    notes that once terms are incorporated into lines of code, the terms of the contract
    are automatically executed by computer transaction protocols based on conditions
    agreed by consensus and incorporated into the computer programme. These are referred
    to as “oracles,” mutually agreed real-time data providers used to confirm triggering
    events [[2](#CR2)].^([2](#Fn2)) There is a need for agreement on what these oracles
    will be since one of the key parts ensuring  the smart contract’s credible operation
    is an agreement (a contract) between those who are using it. It is the mutual
    agreement that gives force to the oracle—taking the ‘real world’ information ‘into’
    the smart contract operation.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最后一组定义突出了合同的性质、创建（将条款转化为计算机代码）以及合同的执行[[19](#CR19)]。Ng的定义指出，一旦条款被纳入代码行中，合同条款将根据共识约定并纳入计算机程序的条件自动执行。这被称为“预言机”，即共同同意的实时数据提供者用于确认触发事件[[2](#CR2)]。^([2](#Fn2))
    由于必须就预言机将会是什么达成一致意见，因为确保智能合同的可信操作的关键部分之一是使用它的人之间的协议（合同）。正是共识协议赋予了预言机力量——将“现实世界”信息“纳入”智能合同操作之中。
- en: The implication of the above views on the smart contract is significant. Those
    of the view that smart contracts are not necessarily equivalent to legal contracts
    tend to play down discussions about the validity or otherwise of smart contracts
    within the context of the legal system. That way, the argument as to the legal
    status of the contracts is reduced to general compliance with the wider legal
    framework and not the legal status of the terms themselves. In this chapter, it
    is argued that given the role that smart contracts may play in the short and medium
    term in the construction industry, it is vital that they are conceptualised from
    the onset as legal agreements to allow for a thorough examination of their legal
    status. This will also encourage conversation around how *legal* language in the
    form of a contract in a *natural* language may be translated into a computer code language.

  zh: 上述观点对智能合同的影响非常重要。那些认为智能合同不一定等同于法律合同的人倾向于淡化讨论智能合同在法律体系背景下的有效性。这种方式，关于合同的法律地位的论点被简化为与更广泛的法律框架的一般遵从性有关，而不是合同条款本身的法律地位。本章论证，鉴于智能合同在建筑行业可能在短期和中期内发挥的作用，至关重要的是从一开始将其概念化为法律协议，以便对其法律地位进行彻底审查。这也将鼓励围绕如何将合同中的“法律”语言以自然语言形式转化为计算机代码语言的对话。

    was said to be an adversarial culture. This exacerbated structural problems where
    lack of cash flow was a major issue in the industry (although that diagnosis goes

    problems. The first saw the emergence of the process of construction adjudication,
    which has now become the primary means of speedy resolution of construction disputes

    the Act and also provides default rules—the Scheme for Construction Contracts^([4](#Fn4))—which

    ‘due date.’ This sets a baseline of 5 days for the provision of a notice by the
    payer of what is considered due. If the payer fails to do so, then there is a
    provision that an earlier application for payment by the payee can stand in its
    stead. There is then an obligation on the payee to pay the sum in the payment

- en: In answering this question, the starting point is whether (or in what circumstances)
    the 1996 Act is at all relevant for governing smart contracts (as envisaged here).
    The legal answer is clear. It is the parties cannot decide that the Act does not
    apply by agreeing that a contract should be bound by the laws of a different legal
    system. In *Motacus Constructions Ltd v Paolo Castelli SpA*,^([10](#Fn10)) there
    was an argument about whether the Act applied to a contract for construction works
    in England, but under a contract that was said to be governed by the law of France.
    In reaching their decision, the court was keen to ensure that the policy of ensuring
    a quick adjudication decision and the ensuing cash flow could not be thwarted
    by a party simply agreeing to contract under the law of a different jurisdiction.
    It is suggested that the reasoning on that point would apply equally to the payment
    provisions (although there are some interesting questions around how valuation
    might work in different jurisdictions). The courts held that the Act governed
    ‘construction operations’ in the UK. They noted that the legislation is itself
    clear that the scope of the Act is over *all* works in the UK—not just those which
    have an agreement to be governed by the law of one of the UK jurisdictions (see
    Section 107(4) of the Act). Rather than looking at the abstract agreement of the
    parties as to the ‘location’ of the contract, the court looked at where the work
    was actually being done. That real-world impact was in the UK and so it was the
    UK framework that applied.

  zh: 在回答这个问题时，起点是1996年法案在管理智能合同（如此所设想的）方面是否相关（或在什么情况下相关）。法律的答案是明确的。如果当事人不能通过同意合同应受其他法律体系管辖来决定法案不适用。在*Motacus
    Constructions Ltd v Paolo Castelli SpA* ([10](#Fn10))中，争论的焦点是1996年法案是否适用于在英国进行建筑工程的合同，但在一份据称受法国法律管辖的合同下。在做出裁决时，法庭急于确保保证迅速做出裁决并随之而来的现金流不能被一方简单地同意以不同司法管辖法律下的合同所扼杀。有人认为这一点的推理同样适用于支付条款（尽管在不同司法管辖下评估可能存在一些有趣的问题）。法院裁定法案管理着在英国的‘建筑工程’。他们指出，立法本身明确规定法案的适用范围覆盖了英国的*所有*工程，不仅仅是那些约定受英国其中一个法律体系管辖的工程（请参阅法案107(4)条款）。法院并没有看具体合同中当事人关于合同‘地点’的抽象协议，而是查看工程实际进行的地点。那个真实世界的影响是在英国，因此适用的是英国的框架。
- en: This demonstrates the point made above; at the point of delivery, a construction
    project needs to be about the creation of a physical thing and that will be in
    a physical place. The process of creation will also have to happen in that place
    for at least some of that period (albeit modular construction techniques may decrease
    the length of time in which that is to happen). Without getting too metaphysical
    and conceptual on the way in which laws apply, the country or region which governs
    the site where the project is being built will have an interest in it. The general
    laws of that state will apply to that building and the people who are working
    there. The question is how the particular features of the more complex regime
    of the 1996 Act will apply as it sits—consciously—on the border between regulation
    and freedom of contract.

    work (which falls within the definition of ‘construction operations’ in the Act) can
    happen without being in any particular ‘place’ and so poses a particular test
    for the application of the Act. For payment, there is a significant issue that
    payment or value can be automatically transferred anywhere (or indeed to some
    sort of conception of ‘nowhere’) and more generally, the generation of intellectual

    The need for cash flow is paramount. While many of the discussions have focused
    specifically on the adjudication process (the ‘argue later’ part of the equation);
    the ‘pay now’ part is integral to the conception of the law. This means that even

    party. However, in many cases, the confidence which is needed to contract is not
    over the identity of the other as such, but confidence that they will do what
    they should. This transparency over payment is a good way of building this trust.
    To a significant extent, it does not matter who is carrying out an obligation;

    any behaviour that frustrates the smooth running of the automated payment system.
    In other words, there could be further research into how smart contracts and blockchains

    trust. Another example would be the use of the smart contract to adjust the payment

    that is intelligible to the parties involved, it allows for understanding and
    transparency—assuring the credibility of the payment mechanism. By providing for
    means of enforcement, which again operate in terms of a particular place, it means
    that there is a reason to comply: which reinforces the whole edifice. The incentives
    of the contract shift by requiring the parties to consider and justify their decisions.
    That brings benefits to the whole project—and helps facilitate the use of the
    smart contract.'
