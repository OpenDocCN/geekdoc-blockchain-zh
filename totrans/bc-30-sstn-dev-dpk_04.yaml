- en: The blockchain technology (BCT) or distributed ledgers is an emergent technology
    that allows the autonomous and immutable preservation of checked data by offering
    a revolutionary forum of a modern, decentralized and transparent exchange system
    for industries and companies. The inherited characteristics of BCT foster trust
    by clarity and traceability in every transaction involving records, products and
    financial capital. Through initial concerns, governments and major companies have
    recently investigated the implementation and improvement of this BCT in different
    fields of use, including supply chain (SC) networks. Slowly, the community of
    this sector realizes how profoundly blockchain (BC) could affect their industry.
    BC’s ability to guarantee accuracy, quality control and authenticity of data,
    coupled with smart contractual partnerships, represents a major reconsideration
    of SC and supply chain management (SCM). It provides more and more logistic items
    with sensors that produce data in the SC, for example, on the shipment status.
    This data must be processed in an external, open manner. Current practices for
    the types of obstacles to implementing BCTs are implemented in the fields of interorganizational,
    intraorganizational, technological and external barriers. Procurement costs, shipping
    costs, inventory costs and quality costs are the four primary reasons that increased
    the expenses in the conventional supply chains. In this research, we have identified
    the barriers against the use or development of sustainable SCM, by taking views
    of 500 working professionals of various global SC-oriented companies. The study’s
    outcome by using linear regression reviled economic obstacles, cross barriers,
    structure barriers and communication threats. Related barriers are BC barriers
    in general. Similarly, it can limit the use of BCT for SC. To improve these problems
    and to improve sustainability, the SC should also decrease resource use, reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions, check that the commodity is renewable in terms of greenhouse
    gas emissions, increase recycling, improve emissions sharing schemes (ETS) and
    improve governance using information management mechanism by understanding the
    barriers.

    is being submitted in system for confirmation and inspecting purposes. Until most
    lumps in the restraint accept this operation in line with the predefined agreed
    rules, this payment update will be added as a new slab to BC. The archive of this
    transaction is stored in a set of distributed security nodes. In the meantime,
    the smart contract, which is a central feature of the BCT, enables credible transactions
    to be carried out without the intervention of external parties.

    and BCT is that the net was built to transfer knowledge (not worth) further to
    pass versions of items (not initial details). In BC, trust is expressed in contracts
    registered in a public ledger and protected by having a factual, publicly posted
    transaction history that offers reliable and auditable evidence [[3](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_003)].
    These transfers occur in a testing mechanism compatible with the principles of
    the network consensus. If the latest transactions are validated and applied to
    the BC, several versions are generated in a distributed way to develop a series
    of confidence.

    of knowledge, thereby growing the information’s authenticity. Collectively managed
    databases are unworkable and checked databases of each transaction are made available
    to participants via circulated Federal and State Books [[1](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_001)].
    Communication systems are far more vulnerable to abuse, violation or failure [[4](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_004)].
    Trust is a significant effect of deregulation because it is easy to test traders
    or other network members [[5](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_005)], and the proof is
    readily seen and matched. This process does not consider any organization and
    is faced on behalf of its members, but the basic framework ensures the credibility
    of the framework. Participants can make purchases. This functionality provides

    privacy by retaining cryptographic documents [[1](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_001)].
    BC may be extended and familiar with enforcing a negotiated series of rubrics
    which maybe no one, including the manipulators or the framework operatives, will
    alter. They depend on a specific device design model for applications affecting
    various parties that involve little faith in one another; for instance, fractured
    execution.

    publicly or privately impact books and records and networks [[7](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_007)].
    Its architecture is distinct from all the matches on the platform and the guidelines
    for managing the BC. In a proprietary or closed BC, the stakeholders are identified.
    Since their is no confidentiality, they can be treated similar, just as in an
    SC network of established individuals involved in the manufacture and sale of
    goods. Additional functions, such as certifiers, will include validation to the
    SC network members and manage. It is a digital platform. As a replacement, in
    a direct or transparent BC, to maintain many unidentified users’ trust, cryptological
    approaches are used to allow operators to join the system and track their dealings
    [[8](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_008)]. In the meantime, the newest cohort of transaction
    with requests that build loyalty, reliability and efficiency is being promoted
    by BCT, which is regulated by an alleged smart agreement.

    A smart contract’s reasoning is applied by a consortium of members that come to
    a conclusion for outcome of the agreement. The agreement executes its coding if
    it receives an order, perhaps by a network player or from another transaction.
    The ledgers shall be updated if the provisions of the contract are met [[10](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_010)].

    in this dynamic network [[17](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_017), [18](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_018)].
    Understaffed sales contribute to a greater level of confidence and honesty, which
    makes physicians believe you are cheating. Traceability is an important concern
    in many SC sectors, including the food sector, which includes maintaining track
    of the procurement of food, pharmaceuticals and surgical materials [[13](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_013),
    [19](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_019)]. Objects that were produced in the past, with
    specific identifying details, will easily be lost or changed. Lack of clarity
    in the sector makes it impossible to know the true worth of every good. The costs
    involved in the collection, reliability and transparency of intermediaries also
    impede traceability within the SC. Strategic and reputational strategic issues
    exist because of these threats and lack of accountability. And Maradol brand papaya
    did suffer from a salmonella epidemic that led to thousands of people getting
    sick in the United States. First, a typhoid vaccine was detected in the Salmonella
    epidemic but the shipment origin could not be verified. Second, also, dangers
    and threats were identified. Third, 2015 is another example of this. A widespread,
    ongoing *E. coli* outbreak in Chipotle. Mexican Grill outlets, leaving dozens
    of customers ill and turns an epidemic. The epidemic triggered picture problems

    of Chipotle’s SCs has become an issue for Chipotle. This could contribute to more

    and competitive problem. Such questions raise suspicions about whether the current
    SC knowledge schemes can include the details mandatory for the appropriate origin
    of goods and services in a reliable manner that is clear and robust enough to
    be trusted. The solution to these emotional issues is to improve SC’s transparency,

    and deployment of SC networks. BC is already at an early stage of growth, with
    numerous problems resulting from interpersonal, operational, technical or policy-based
    causes [[1](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_001), [29](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_029),

    context of scientific literature for several years. At this point, the evolving
    functional problems are the hallmarks of academic discussions and concerns. The
    issues are yet to be tackled practically and efficiently. In this post, we open
    a conversation emphasizing BC-based SC issues, hurdles, BC integration advantages
    and innovative SC applications. Links with existing theories, the need for a possible
    new approach and study are often discussed; consequently, some concrete theoretical
    proposals exist. The chapter is formulated as follows. The BCT is presented in
    Section 4.2, and its use in the management of the SC is defined in Section 4.3\.
    Section 4.4 introduces the benefits of BC in preserving the sustainability aspects
    of the SC network. In Section 4.5, challenges and obstacles to introducing BCT
    in the SC and support for sustainability are evaluated and divided into four separate
    groups. Study directions and suggestions are set out in Section 4.6\. Section
    4.7 concludes the chapter.

    discuss BCT’s value strategy and its importance to the SC of goods and development,
    its construction and possible new elements for SC power. How BC functions within
    SC is still based on research and development. Unlike Bitcoin and other financial
    BC apps that may be available, SC BC-based networks require locked-in networks,
    proprietary and approved database with several restricted players. However, the

    found in conventional SCs. Like suppliers, dealers and consumers, actors must
    be accredited by a licensed auditor or certifier to retain scheme confidence [[2](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_002)].
    There are also effects on the SC commodity and resource movements. Each commodity
    can have a digital BC presence such that all related parties have clear access
    to the product profile. Protection protocols can be established to restrict contact
    where only individuals again with right digital keys have access to objects. A
    range of specifics can be accessed, including the commodity’s condition, the type
    of the product and the requirements to be applied to the product [[31](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_031)].
    The commodity identification tag is an attribute that connects specific goods
    for their virtual identity in BC [[12](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_012)]. One fascinating
    aspect of the arrangement and flow control is how a commodity is “managed” or
    moved by a single actor. Actors are obtaining authorization to insert new details
    into the profile of another entity or participation. Participation in an exchange
    with another group is likely to be a significant law where authorization acquisition
    may require smart contract agreements and a consensus. Once goods are transferred
    (or shipped) to some other entity, both parties can register a virtual agreement
    and comply with the specifications of a smart contract to validate the trade.
    Since all sides have fulfilled their contract agreements and processes, the transaction
    details will be transferred to the BC servers. Data transaction history must be
    changed automatically with device when a transition is implemented [[12](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_012)].

    (what is the consistency?; how is the scale?; how much of it is?) and the place
    (where it is and the presence of it?; who controls it at all time?). In this manner,
    the BC removes the need for a safe central entity which controls or oversees this
    phase and helps consumers to monitor the chain of custody and transfer of raw
    materials to final purchases. This knowledge is documented when transactions arise
    on these various BC knowledge dimensions, with verifiable changes. BC efficiency
    and accountability are intended to promote resource and knowledge transfer across
    the SC more effectively, with integrated governance criteria. This transition
    may result in the broader change from a sustainable industrial product economy
    to a knowledge economy, to a customization economy. The output would depend strongly
    on expertise, contact and details; not merely on postural characteristics [[32](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_032)].
    For example, consumers may monitor specific product details to improve the costumers’
    confidence in producing qualities [[4](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_004)]. As published
    guidelines, BC-based SC may help to describe the relationship of the network agent
    with each other and within the structure. Smart contracts affect the exchange
    of network data between SC members and continuous process development. Certifiers
    and standard bodies, for example, digitally check the identities and goods of
    the actor. Actors and products have their public network profile, which shows
    definition, venue, qualification and product affiliation. Every SC player will
    log in crucial details regarding the commodity and its position on the BC system
    [[31](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_031)].

    them to a method agreement. This methodology and knowledge style has tremendous
    potential for SC design and real-time effects, above just retail distribution
    and governance issues. BC affects the SC, inventory management systems ([Figure

    portion that covers related literature, including articles, magazines, conference
    articles, study papers and online databases, has been reviewed to recognize various
    hurdles to BCT acceptance, in general, and safe SCs, in particular. Barriers were
    built based on the literature on supply chain management (SCM) systems, transparent
    SCs and BCT. References to the collection of obstacles stem from these three primary
    fields. Expert guidance was also given to help verify the lean of blocks. Obstacles
    are abridged and listed in five major types of the economic obstacles: intraoperational
    barriers, device barriers, external obstacles and related expense barriers, taking
    into account internal and external organizational limitations in introducing new
    technology. The theoretical model of these obstacles is exposed in [Figure 4.4](#b_9783110702507-004_fig_004).'

    official assistance is a crucial element in the effective execution of every SC
    activity. However, individual administrators do not have a long-term dedication
    to endorse the implementation of emerging technologies and environmental principles.
    Lack of management engagement hinders the credibility of SC systems’ sustainable
    activities [[41](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_041)]. The shortage of understanding
    and engagement of managing in the SC will threaten capital distribution [[42](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_042)]
    and financing choices. BCT adoption includes investment in advanced knowledge
    processing hardware and software that is expensive for companies and network providers
    [[43](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_043)]. The absence of the latest corporate policy
    expected to justify the application of BCT might be a problem. BCT adoption can
    alter or turn present corporate philosophies [[44](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_044)].
    Administrative philosophy describes the principles for working communities, standards
    and proper actions within companies [[45](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_050)]. Besides,
    the implementation of BCT in SC systems involves additional positions, obligations
    and skills to promote various areas of technology adoption [[44](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_044)].

    BCT serve as an obstacle to the introduction of this emerging technology into
    the SC. While there is an interest in BC in the commercial industry, there is
    a small number of implementations and professional developers of BC [[43](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_043)].
    BCT is a software application [[27](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_027)] that may be
    destructive and has to be changed or substituted by obsolete systems [[43](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_043)].
    Converting to different methods will shift the corporate philosophy or pyramid
    and contribute for opposition with apprehension on persons and associations [[46](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_046)].
    Hypothetically, utilizing the Technology Acceptance model (TAM), the degree of
    usefulness of modern information technologies in a way of its accessibility and
    usability for individuals and organizations can be measured and calculated [[47](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_047),
    [48](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_048)]. The BC curriculum may be measured via a TAM
    point of view. Suppose companies want active SCs to promote emerging information
    structures that are part of the entire SC network. In that scenario, sustainable
    activities must be integrated into their business philosophy and purpose [[49](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_049)].
    Constructive sustainable initiatives are therefore required across all corporate
    levels and around the SC [[50](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_050)]. The absence of
    formal tools, processes and metrics hinders the effective adoption and assessment
    of sustainable activities [[51](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_051)] in the BC environment
    for a given company. BCT is in its early stages, and it is challenging to identify
    the SCs that have effectively adopted this technology to monitor their innovative
    activities. The scarcity of market frameworks and best practices for applying
    BCT is a problem [[43](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_043)]. Environmental laws are
    one of the critical pillars of ecological policies in companies. Organizations
    are spending and trying to fulfill the minimum sustainability requirements but
    can, at the same time, obstruct their ingenuity and progress in applying sustainable
    approaches [[52](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_052)]. The desire of consumers for sustainable
    goods and methods is a catalyst that can boost innovation in sustainability. The
    lack of consumer understanding and willingness to commit to environmental growth
    is a threat to sustainability. In this situation, consumers do not recognize green
    certification programs and are reluctant to adopt conservation measures or spend
    much on sustainably acquaint products [[51](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_051), [53](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_053)].

    SC stakeholders. SCM is mainly concerned with maintaining partnerships between
    parties to build benefits for interested parties [[15](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_015)].
    However, relations amongst associates may be difficult, particularly at the time
    of the convergence of information technology and sustainability practices. BCT
    will allow the exchange of knowledge across the SC. While openness and verifiability
    of information are required to determine the SC’s reliability efficiency [[54](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_054)],
    individual companies can take input as a low-cost gain that allows them unlikely
    to disclose useful and essential information [[55](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_055)].
    The reluctance to disclose details as of collaborators could restrict the maximum
    gains from adopting BCT and delay the practical application of BCT.

    data in SCs may contribute to new problems for exchanging data between stakeholders
    [[55](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_055)]. The confidentiality of knowledge in BCT
    exchange regulations and procedures must be specified and handled inside the SC
    network. The absence of proper knowledge exchange guidelines inevitably affects
    cooperation between SC stakeholders [[45](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_045)]. Lack
    of coordination and efficient cooperation between SC stakeholders with different
    and sometimes conflicting organizational goals and expectations [[51](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_051)]
    disrupts sustainability [[56](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_056)] and SC activities
    and the introduction of BC builds sustainability principles. Contact problems
    might be more substantial if SC participants were widely spread through diverse
    communities [[52](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_052)]. Finally, merging typical SC
    strategies with sustainable activities is not a simple task. Present systems,
    prototypes, products and procedures required change to promote sustainable activities
    [[54](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_054), [57](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_057)]. Reducing
    carbon impact, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, energy usage and waste
    involves replacing products, machines and installations. It placed expenses on
    the SC. Similarly, the gathering of knowledge for BCT uses often includes its
    laboratories and computers. RFID and the Internet of things are two possible answers
    to this problem.

    Internet of things). It could be a problem for certain actors in SC [[12](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_012)].
    Both chain members continue to gain access to the knowledge they need to take
    advantage of the profit by reducing the time period in their interconnected SC
    [[45](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_045), [58](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_058)]. Consequently,
    the restriction of technical connectivity to real-time knowledge in SC is an obstacle
    to adopting BCT. BCT is at its initial phase of development and is known to be
    an inexperienced scalability and managing technology for a large amount of purchases
    [[30](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_030)]. The size and number of blocks are a storage
    problem for processing large data in real-time use, named a “bloat” issue in Bitcoin
    [[27](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_027)]. SC systems must have much more significant
    data criteria, which go beyond financial details to provide data relevant to processes
    and activities. Improvements in resource technology and integrated cloud processing
    systems would also be required. Information exploitation of SC networks may be
    a primary task [[59](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_059)]. Although the introduction
    of BCT allows any participant in the SC networks to validate transactions, deception
    is still possible through the consent of the contestants [[27](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_027)].
    Data confidentiality with safety issues are also the problems linked to BCT usage
    [[43](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_043)]. Some study has discussed the protection
    risk of BCT in the Bitcoin network, including breaches with assaults [[60](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_060)].

    evaluation has been made to these strategies’ effectiveness [[30](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_030)].
    Currently, BCT is mainly synonymous with cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and its
    illicit activity [[27](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_027)], the “dark web” stigma that
    slows down BCT acceptance in general. Another primary feature of the BCT is the
    immutability of knowledge. It ensures the experience is unable to be upgraded
    and erased without a majority in BC. It avoids the falsification and adulteration
    of data [[4](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_004)]. Though, people are already interested
    in the implementation of this technology with the risk of providing wrongly reported
    records. If critical owners are willing to modify and upgrade the papers with
    additional details, the scar with the incorrect form will still remain in the
    BC [[61](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_061)].

    demands and encouragement for adopting environmental and technology strategies

    government and business policies and desire to guide and encourage efficient and
    healthy practices is an obstacle to innovation and innovative technical support
    systems [[62](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_062)]. Policy rules and guidelines regarding
    the use of BCT are also uncertain. Indeed, many governments’ adverse policies
    on Bitcoin are of interest to businesses and companies and could affect the broader
    use of BC for corporate purposes [[43](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_043)]. Governments,

    guarantee to clients that they would pay their developments in renewable goods,
    sustainable systems and emerging innovations such as BC. The study and clustering
    of BCT hurdles would pave the way for a successful awareness of emerging technology
    in SC networks and developing sustainability dimensions of the SC. These variables
    are not empirically checked nor proven, but the structure and influences offer
    a starting point for potential studies. More in-depth research is likely to contribute
    to additional wider theoretical problems outside inter/intraorganizational environment,
    technological and external contexts, such as political campaigns to globalize
    SC networks. Building on certain simple understandings, advantages and obstacles

    one of the significant elements. In every SC, the cost for replacing slow, manual
    processes for the smooth functioning of the supply of raw materials is required.
    Under a good SC the cost of strengthening traceability is to be measured carefully
    to handle a good relationship with the SC partners. Further, the BC-based SC system
    aims to reduce SC IT transaction costs; this may be possible with the preapproved
    transaction fees and accurate measurement of the current system with the auditability
    and audit cost control feature. Under this stage, the primary barrier is the time
    delays and cost associated with it, which is further subject to human error and
    its cost, transportation costs, inventory costs and quality cost. To move forward,
    the research plan for the implementation of the BCT for SCs, we suggest research-based
    proposals on the effects of adopting the BCT in the SC sense by analyzing the
    barriers and shedding light on the methods that can be used to overcome this situation.

    SCM in global context includes six variables, that is, financial constraints (EB_1),
    management commitment and support (EB_2), lack of organizational policies for
    using technology (EB_3), hesitation to convert to the new system (EB_6), lack
    of a tool for BT implementation in sustainable SCs (EB_7) and luxury and high-value
    items can easily be lost or altered (EB_8) with the value of adjusted *R*² at
    65.3%, and the importance of ANOVA is also found to be significant. It means the
    selected variables are significantly treated as an economic barrier for BC’s application
    in SC.

    lake with consumers awareness with sustainable development patterns and BCT (IOB_1),
    challenges in the convergence of environmental activities and BCT by SCM (IOB_4),
    cultural gaps between SC partners (IOB_5) and missing one block impact of crushing
    whole BC (IOB_6) with the value of adjusted *R*² at 42.1%, and the importance
    of ANOVA is also found to be significant.

    innovations (SB_2), immutability problem for BCT (SB_4), application immaturity
    (SB_5), virus and software-related threat (SB_6), improvement in the system with
    upgradability (SB_7) with the value of adjusted *R*² at 11.8% and significant
    value of ANOVA; the external barriers include lack of organizational strategies
    (EXT_B_1), lack of industry participation in legal and environmental procedures
    (EXT_B_3), use of confidence in the method (EXT_B_5) and consensus on adoption
    (EXT_B_7) with the value of adjusted *R*² at 35.5%; ANOVA value is found to be
    significant. Finally, the cost-related barriers include cost for replacing slow,
    manual processes (CRB_1), cost of strengthening traceability (CRB_2), time delays
    and cost associated with it (CRB_6), transportation costs (CRB_8), inventory costs
    (CRB_9), quality cost (CRB_10) with the value of adjusted *R*² at 50.8%, and ANOVA
    value is found to be significant. It reveals that the variable selected is significantly
    treated as an essential barrier that affects BCT in SC management (as shown in
    [Figure 4.5](#b_9783110702507-004_fig_005)). This managerial application of the
    research is vast since the variables that are identified in the study will be
    the barriers against the use of the motion of application of BCT in SC. We have
    already analyzed the benefits of BCT into SCM, and the management needs to address
    these variables for implementation of BCT in SC management.

- en: In this chapter, we suggested and addressed the implementation of BCT in the
    SC network. We have tried to identify obstacles that can impede the implementation
    of the SC BCT. The architecture of BC-based SCM facilitates the generation of
    open, encrypted and shared ledgers, autonomous digital contracts (smart contracts),
    and trustworthy and protected networks. It also enables transactions between partners
    (peer-to-peer) through the location of middlemen/intermediaries on the network.
    In addition to the description of the BCT and its implementation in the SC, the
    challenges confronting BCT implementation organizations are summarized in this
    chapter. Many of these hurdles are focused on hypotheses and literature that found
    related transformative developments. These are early research that explicitly
    describe and classify BC blockades with unique to SC usage of technology. The
    BC hurdles for SC adoption have been reviewed as multi-faceted challenges influencing
    the relationship with SC participants and the employees of the participants and
    their stakeholders. Also, technological hurdles relevant to BC acceptance, some
    branches from BCT irresponsibility and arrangement-related BCT matters, which
    may restrict its adoption, require more effort in future experiments, and more
    focus needs to be provided to realistic technical solutions for scalability concerns.
    Additionally, experiential investigations are compulsory to examine multiple barriers’
    implication and assess causal relationship. This analysis would pave the foundations
    for the effective management of the BC implementation.

    infrequently been explored in past learned studies. Further investigations may
    also be obligatory to assess the acceptance of BCT for various purposes. In order
    to promote a fundamental review, we have put forward a variety of available research
    projects that focus on the comment concerns raised by BC-enabled SCs. In addition
    to the potential theoretical concepts of analysis, technical and advancement research
    relevant to various SC themes is also needed. For example, fragmented SC collaboration
    [[63](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_063), [64](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_064)], resource
    and sharing of knowledge [[65](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_065)], virtual market
    [[66](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_066), [67](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_067)], agile
    SCM [[68](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_068), [69](#b_9783110702507-004_ref_069)] and
    resilience SC [particularly 69] that provides the wider usage of BCT for commercial
    purposes has already started. Investigations are required to study case studies
    and pilot projects and to have useful functional experience to facilitate the
    application of BC. The successful post-implementation and failure factors of this
    technology would also be discussed in future studies. We have measured the relative
    value of BCT to SC resistance. Future studies will also step in this direction
    where the environmental and social/human aspects of sustainability, including
    the sustainable development targets and ainable development goals (SDGs) of a
    particular nation, may be used as an analogy to explore the BC-enabled SC productivity.
    There are significant opportunities for a deeper understanding and application
    of this technology beyond traditional knowledge systems and the web-based penetration
    of SCs. Transdisciplinary activities would be needed to consider the full ramifications
    of BCT in the SC. Technical associations need to be active to collaborate alongside
    universities to establish guidelines to include realistic success metrics on BCT
    application. Undoubtedly, there is a significant amount of study in this field
    toward the potential course of trade and commerce.
