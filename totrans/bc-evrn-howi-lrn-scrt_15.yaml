    the social media company that offered its stock to the public in March 2017\.
    Snap started as Snapchat, a social media app where people could send photos to
    each other, with the photos automatically deleted after viewing.

    photos to each other. “Sexting, sexting, sexting. That was the narrative for the

    invest in the hot young company. On its first day of trading, the stock opened
    at $24 per share, giving Snap a total value of about $20 billion, on par with
    long-standing companies like Marriott and Target.^([17](notes.html#ch00-fn17))

    Street. IPO might stand for “It’s probably overpriced.” And it’s overpriced on

    no one was sure if they were legal. If they were stocks, they would be regulated

    deal of trouble later on, as we shall see in Part 3.
