- en: Quantum blockchain is a distributed database that is decentralized, encrypted,
    and based on quantum information theory and computation. This comes as a result
    of the recent progress made in quantum computing and the need for quantum equivalents
    of classical blockchains. Algorithms, frameworks, models, tools, architectures,
    and databases, of which quantum blockchain is a part, are still being standardized.
    Recently, the growth of quantum information theory and computation has resulted
    in a rise in the number of research ongoing in this domain. This chapter presents
    an insight into quantum blockchain using the PRISMA technique with results registered
    and analyzed. The literature is analyzed based on some parameters or categorizations

    in fields like medicine, energy, and finance. It is distributed and encrypted
    to prevent tampering (Kiktenko et al, 2018). The present blockchain networks depends
    on schemes, which are susceptible to assaults from quantum computers despite their
    promise in a wide range of applications. The most serious is the storage problem
    in blockchain systems, which arises from the fact that each node must store a
    copy of all blocks. Immutability is a fundamental attribute of blockchain systems,
    which has gained some attention in recent times. Due to their promise to offer
    accountability, transparency, and redundancy, blockchain technologies have been
    advocated for a variety of applications in recent years ([Fernandez-Carames &
    Fraga-Lamas, 2020](#r19)). [Figure 1](#f01) below shows a diagram comprising the
    various types of blockchain technology.

    Furthermore, their study proposed two ways to avoid the misapplication of blockchain's
    redaction functionality. They proposed a key management mechanism, which is fully
    distributed for the first scheme, and used the general framework to handle the
    redaction-misuse problem that still exists in blockchains, but they also suggested
    a voting strategy for their second scheme. To better comprehend their work, they
    demonstrated how to combine the blockchain technology with the hash with relatively

    at each block in their work. The suggested DSB system encrypts the data block
    with the AES-256 encryption technique before distributing it to nodes at each

    search for content that met the inclusion requirements from 2017 to 2021 was conducted
    in five databases, including Science Direct, Google Scholar, Springer, ACM Digital
    Library, and IEEE Xplore, in November 2021\. The terms “Blockchain” and “Quantum
    blockchain” were among those used. With the help of the Boolean operators “AND,”
    “OR,” and “NOT,” the keywords were combined to produce a high-quality search strategy.
    Peer-reviewed journals and papers were taken into consideration. After lengthy
    discussion among the authors, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed
    based on the objective of the study. Reading through the records' titles, abstracts,
    and keywords to locate those that met the criteria for the preliminary selection.
    Using the reference list of the accepted literature, further pertinent articles
    were discovered. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and

    the blockchain, it is necessary to integrate resource-controlled IoT devices with
    blockchain. This integration procedure is a potential future area for study that
    could help to advance blockchain and IoT research and development ([Latif et al,
    2021](#r42)). In addition to networking and computing constraints, IoT devices
    struggle with a lack of authorisation and authentication, restricted compatibility,
    and other issues. Blockchains have the versatility to integrate with IoT devices
    since they can be used to store both structured and unstructured data over a network
    ([Latif et al, 2021](#r42)). The extension of blockchain to the IoT edge could
    be another future study direction. Blockchain's high performance and networking
    overhead prevent it from being used on resource-constrained IoT devices. Lightweight
    clients can be used with IoT gateways to push transactions into the blockchain
    network in order to solve this problem ([Latif et al, 2021](#r42)). Other potential
    prospects include IoT blockchain-based applications, IoT blockchain-based security,
    IoT data quality using blockchain, IoT blockchain data governance, IoT blockchain-based
    trust management, IoT blockchain-based automation, and IoT blockchain identity
    and identification management (Lunesu et al, 2021).

    and the 10 minute increase in block sizes are all problems. Due to its 7 transaction
    limit per second, Bitcoin is not appropriate for high-frequency trading. As a
    result, the larger the block, the more storage space is required, resulting in
    slower network diffusion. As a result, decentralization in the blockchain is required
    ([Kaur et al, 2020](#r32)). This is a fascinating subject for future research
    since understanding the origins of these coins and how they are reflected in their
    long-term performance of value is crucial for teaching and educating businesses

    which stop the creation of new tokens without authorization, are used to make
    this possible. The ability to make transactions private and verifiable comes at
    the expense of storage space because the representation of a transaction now involves
    many cryptographic elements, such as signatures and proofs, that must be recorded
    on the ledger. Soon, the Monero community plans to replace one of the verbose
    facets in transactions, range proofs, with bulletproofs ([Bünz et al, 2018](#r12);

- en: According to Quarmby, JPMorgan Chase has published research on a quantum key
    distribution (QKD) blockchain network that is immune to quantum computing attacks.
    QKD is the only solution that has been mathematically demonstrated to be able
    to ward off a future quantum computing-based attack ([Quarmby, 2022](#r53)). Using
    post-quantum keys, Allende López et al. introduced a second signature in transactions,
    examined quantum-resistance principles in respect to blockchain networks, and
    developed a system to secure information transmission between blockchain nodes
    over the internet (Allende López, 2021).

    secure and employs post-quantum computing technologies in its design for absolute
    security, as audited by red4sec and x41 D-sec, presents important information
    about the future of post-quantum resistant blockchains ([QRL, 2022](#r52)). Zhang
    et al. presented a blockchain system based on a quantum-resistant digital signature
    ([Zhang et al, 2021](#r73)). Quantum resistance is the next blockchain frontier,
    with a system called QANplatform widely regarded as the first truly quantum-resistant
    blockchain.

- en: Decentralized programs (DApps) are permitted on QAN, unlike some other purportedly
    quantum-resistant blockchains, and developers can quickly build quantum-resistant
    DApps utilizing the platform's free developer tools. As an alternative to QAN,
    the creators of many well-known blockchains are already thinking about implementing
    their own quantum-resistance techniques, such as the recently created commit-delay-reveal
    scheme, which may be used to convert Bitcoin to a quantum-resistant state. However,
    none of the top ten blockchains in terms of user numbers has yet to commit to
    a quantum-resistant signature technique, leaving the future of post-quantum encryption
    in limbo ([Thompson, 2021](#r62)).

- en: With a quantum-resistant platform, the scalability and bandwidth issues with
    the blockchain are resolved. Blockchains must be protected against this unavoidable
    reality by using cryptographic keys that can withstand attacks from the most powerful
    computers on the planet. As a result, third-generation blockchain solutions are
    already being developed by platforms like Cellframe that have publicly shared
    their work. The Cellframe solution starts with quantum-resistant signatures, some
    of which are already integrated into the Cellframe architecture and some of which
    are finalist signatures from the NIST PQC contest, with many more integrations
    planned in line with the team's mission to build a secure and decentralized environment
    to maintain the freedom of the internet. The study of quantum-resistant blockchain
    techniques or schemes, as well as their standardization and implementation, may
    provide a path for future research ([Jansen, 2021](#r29)).

    reviewed in this paper was in 2021 followed by 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.
    This seems to indicate a trend of increasing research and interest in the area
    of quantum blockchain starting from 2017 to 2021\. From [Table 2](#t2) and [Figure
    4](#f04), Nineteen (19) articles were gotten from Springer, Thirteen (13) from
    IEEE Xplore, Nine (9) from ScienceDirect, Nine (9) from Google Scholar, and Three
    (3) from ACM Digital Library. This indicates that most of the quantum blockchain
    literature used in the analysis was from the Springer data source. From [Table
    3](#t3) and [Figure 5](#f05), out of the Fifty Three (53) quantum blockchain literature
    used in the numerical analysis and graphical representations, Twenty Four (24)
    of the literature highlighted permissionless quantum blockchain and Twenty Nine
    (29) talked about permissioned quantum blockchain. From [Table 4](#t4) and [Figure
    6](#f06), Twenty Three (23) of the articles talked about public quantum blockchains,
    Fifteen (15) on private (or managed) quantum blockchains, Seven (7) on consortium
    quantum blockchains, and Seven (7) on hybrid quantum blockchains. From [Table
    5](#t5) and [Figure 7](#f07), Six (6) of the articles were related to supply chain,
    Two (2) on accounting, Four (4) on tokenization, Twenty (20) on identity management,
    Seventeen (17) on Trade and Finance, and Four (4) on others. To further have an
    insight on the differences between classical and quantum blockchains, a comparative
    analysis is shown in [Table 6](#t6) below.
