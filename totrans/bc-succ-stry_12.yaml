    services solutions that connect information, processes, and software across the
    enterprise. Hyland had been actively involved in blockchain at the local and international
    level, and many of its customers were in healthcare, financial institutions, government,
    and higher education.
  prefs: []

    was that by adding Learning Machine’s digital credentialing to Hyland’s content
    services platform, customers could generate, manage, share, and verify digital
    documents. From Chris’s perspective, Learning Machine’s customers would benefit
    from the value created by Hyland’s software platform.

    Blockcerts would give Hyland customers a unique digital advantage—not to mention
    huge cost savings.

    its product into Hyland’s existing platform offerings. The team would also have
    to figure out a fair price. Further, as with any acquisition involving organizations
    with different physical locations, they’d have to figure out communication and
