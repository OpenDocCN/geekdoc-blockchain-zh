- en: With the advent of blockchain technology (BT), the global business is undergoing
    a major transformation. This technology originated primarily to support Bitcoin
    cryptocurrency as a way of providing support for conducting reliable transactions
    with instantaneous verification. The immutable and supposedly tamper-proof nature
    of the records, which are the byproducts of blockchain, provide trust between
    the parties involved in a transaction. Using BT, individuals are able to virtually
    do business, enter contracts and exchange goods and services with authentication.
    In addition, this technology establishes a permanent audit trail. In this chapter,
    we discuss business applications of BT in terms of recording, valuing and verifying
    transactions. We also explore the ramifications of blockchain for the audit of
    corporate financial reports and associated accounting challenges, especially those
    involving cryptocurrencies.

- en: The blockchain technology (BT) is revolutionizing the business worldwide. The
    initial foundation was laid by Satoshi Nakamoto whose motivation was to conceptualize
    and improvise the emerging cryptocurrency concept popularly known as Bitcoin.
    Without the BT, Bitcoins were just timestamped digital documents used for purchasing
    goods and services. The BT provided the underlying architecture for Bitcoins by
    providing support for establishing public tamper-proof ledgers. In addition, BT
    has changed the digital landscape by introducing concepts such as e-coins, data
    security, personal identification and the Internet of things. Since traditional
    methods of payment and data processing are becoming outdated, accounting practices
    and financial record-keeping are also under pressure to change in order to keep
    pace with BT. Understanding the intricacies of this technology will be crucial
    for conducting financial and operational audits, developing effective regulation,
    especially those addressing a new class of assets (e.g., cryptocurrency) and managing
    supply chains and financial ledgers.

    as centralized agents to mediate financial transactions and disputes. The advent
    of Bitcoins and their acceptance over traditional modes of payments has totally
    eliminated the concept of centralized intermediaries. An everyday example of this
    is the widespread use of the debit/credit card. Using a credit or debit card,
    an individual can transfer funds from a secure account that is controlled by a
    centralized establishment using carefully monitored plastic cards. With the BT,
    as personified by Bitcoins, there is no need for a centralized authority such
    as VISA to manage the financial transactions [[1](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_001)].

- en: The entire notion of the BT revolves around the interaction of blocks of data.
    The data include bits of information, a lengthy identification code and the identification
    code of another block generated previously. The concept of “chained” comes from
    the fact that the information codes of shared blocks are connected. In order to
    ensure security, the identification code is generated using the hash function,
    which ensures that if the information is changed in a block, then the identification
    code also changes as well. Each successive block contains information from their
    chained neighbors. Therefore, any unwanted changes in the blockchain will result
    in introducing errors within all the participating blocks. In addition to that,
    blockchains are shared on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network resulting in blockchains
    being separated and copied to a large number of hosts. Essentially, any changes
    on one singular block result in the blockchain being alerted throughout the P2P
    network. These measures ensure a decentralized approach to support security and
    trust.

    can be used to send assets overseas. For a customer to send funds overseas, they
    have to interact with a payment service such as Xoom or PayTm and with the bank
    in the recipient’s country. First, the customer needs to deposit funds with Xoom.
    Second, Xoom would then send the funds to a sister office in another nation. Finally,
    the funds would be deposited into the account of the recipient after converting
    the funds into the currency of the recipient’s nation. This is an extensive process
    and takes a few hours or even a day. In addition to that, the customer must bear
    the transaction cost to complete the exchange. However, with BT, the client needs
    to upload their assets to a digital wallet and send the asset to the recipient
    in a matter of seconds with no fees associated with the transaction. To ensure
    the validity of the transaction, the information is stashed in the P2P network
    as a block of data.

- en: The popularity and dominance of BT have changed entire models of supply chains.
    In traditional supply chain, intermediaries were used for validating and confirming
    transactions but with the BT the validation and confirmation of the transaction
    are supported by the blocks of data chained across in the P2P network. According
    to Korpela et al. [[2](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_002)], the key motivation with
    the use of BT “is the efficiency associated with minimizing governance costs,
    including the costs of exchange with other ecosystem participants and with those
    within the individual organization” (p. 4183). Due to the depreciation of cost
    and complexity, there is growing interest and demand for the adoption of BT in
    digital global supply chains. Blockchains enables digital supply chains to be
    very quick and cost-effective. The P2P method enables trust because the data is
    publicly shared within the network. However, Korpela et al. [[2](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_002)]
    argue that “[Blockchain] cannot meet the need for standardization of electronic
    supply chain documents, international document standards must be relied on it
    for that purpose” (p. 4186). However, with the advancements in the BT, standardization
    will not be an issue in the future.

    decentralized ledger. For example, buyers can find out and know precisely where
    their products are coming from and how businesses are treating their suppliers
    and workers. Referring to the Apple Foxconn scandal, Abeyratne [[3](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_003)]
    argued that consumers reacted badly to apparent environmental and working conditions
    abuses and that they wanted to know where their goods were manufactured and sold.
    The BT can make all this information available to customers using distributed
    ledger recorded in the P2P network, thereby enhancing transparency for all. Adding
    to the complication, Abeyratne [[3](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_003)] further notes
    that “in a large supply chain system, it is challenging to have an overall picture
    of transactions within the chains. The information is typically stored in multiple
    locations and are accessible to certain system entities” (p. 4). Overall, the
    distributed ledger can provide the complete picture of supply chain operations
    performed by different parties involved in specific transactions.

    can be completed in two operations within the electronic wallets. Primarily, the
    sender verifies if he/she has enough funds in their wallet and that the fund has
    not been used for any other transactions to prevent a double-spending scenario.
    In the double-spending scenario, the same fund is misused on two different occasions.
    Once it is confirmed that the funds have not been used for any other transactions,
    then the new transaction is stored forever in a new block, which is then fused
    to a continuous blockchain. This blockchain will then be available for the public
    to verify and remain unhackable. Catalini [[4](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_004)]
    discussed the role of the Bitcoin miners as one who would take on the “additional
    computational work required to assemble new, valid blocks and commit them to the
    shared ledger” (p. A-2). As the miners are involved in validating the transactions,
    the process is very much shared and secured. [Figure 2.1](#b_9783110702507-002_fig_001)
    shows a rough flowchart of how transactions are verified through the blockchain.
    However, this technology is also subject to certain constraints. Initially, blocks
    were limited to be of a finite number of bits, but due to the popularity of this
    technology, the number of bits has to be increased to handle high traffic, which
    invariably increases the transaction time. Unlike the traditional credit and debit
    card system that can handle hundreds and thousands of transactions per second,
    the Bitcoin technology can only manage a few hundred transactions every 10 min.
    Also, the decentralized P2P processing nature of this technology demands an enormous
    computing power to verify the transactions via the coin mining operations.

- en: Blockchain is a trust-building technology. Auditors serve in the role of maintaining
    and enhancing public trust and confidence in the capital markets. With all its
    technological and other challenges, external audits of public corporations remain
    an important part of the proper functioning of global capital markets. Over a
    period of time, businesses have gone global, transactions have become more complex
    and accounting practices have advanced to address the numerous challenges introduced
    by technological and other factors. Blockchain is one technology that is revolutionizing
    accounting practice with important implications in auditors and regulators. Earlier,
    we discussed that the BT is a digital ledger used for capturing transactions initiated
    by various parties in a network. The digital ledger is composed of blocks that
    can keep track of all the transactions, which are available to all parties in
    the private network and are verifiable at any time. The new products created by
    BT (e.g., cryptocurrencies) pose unique challenges for accountants in terms of
    measurement, valuation and recording of these products. At the same time, this
    technology also offers opportunities for more efficient verification of transactions
    during an audit.

    public interest. An independent audit of financial records of a public company
    is conducted for regulatory purposes, and culminates in certification (audit opinion)
    of the veracity of financial statements as fairly representing the company’s state
    of affairs. Blockchain drastically increases the reliability and accuracy of records.
    Although digital files are vulnerable to being modified, that is not possible
    in the blockchain world where digital pieces of information are stored in decentralized
    databases. According to Andersen [[5](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_005)], companies
    can write their transactions directly into a joint register, thus creating an
    interlocking system of everlasting accounting records. “Since all the transaction
    entries are distributed and cryptographically locked, falsifying or destroying
    them to conceal activity is practically impossible” (p. 3). Vetter [[6](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_006)]
    has also emphasized the fact that auditing services can be bolstered via emerging
    BT. According to Vetter [[6](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_006)], auditors can benefit
    from this technology by focusing more on designing, reviewing and verifying the
    information flow between the systems rather than spending time performing audits.

    to the transaction, and their digital signatures. Each block in the chain has
    a unique ID called a hash. The hash acts as a digital, timestamped fingerprint
    or barcode. This can drastically improve auditor efficiency in terms of the speed
    with which they can verify transactions. For example, the need to confirm customers’
    outstanding accounts receivable balances may very well be eliminated. With blockchain,
    an immutable audit trail that can ensure outstanding receivables nearly instantaneously
    can be created. This process can be automated so that any mismatched strings would
    automatically raise a red flag, alert the auditor in a continuous audit. As such,
    blockchain offers auditors a tool to confirm audit evidence throughout the year,
    not just periodically. To audit a blockchain shared ledger, a blockchain private
    network would need to be set up between the auditor, the client, and the client’s
    third party [[7](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_007)]. Each party would have a different
    type of access to prevent tampering. For example, an auditor would have access
    to the full range of accounting data while an accounts receivable clerk only has
    access to accounting information related to customer accounts, their payment history
    and outstanding credit transactions. Auditors can view the automatic confirmation
    of transactions which are validated via consensus, distributed on the private
    and permissioned network, and are therefore immutable [[7](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_007)].

    the Sarbanes–Oxley Act would require public companies to identify the key risks
    related to BT and to model their internal control processes to address those risks.
    The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) identified four
    key risks that a transaction in the blockchain is: unauthorized, fraudulent or
    illegal, executed between related parties, linked to a side “off chain” agreement
    or incorrectly classified in the financial statements (*Blockchain Technology

    of the digital ledgers is required, including government sanction of what is permissible,
    what is not. Currently, the United States government is not encouraging the use
    of Bitcoins and cryptocurrency [[8](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_008)]. These virtual
    currencies are a product of BT that has the potential to disrupt traditional financial
    institutions. Bitcoin is currently the leader in the cryptocurrency market, with
    a market capitalization of over 150 billion. With a market that has grown exponentially
    over the past year, Bitcoin has beat the odds in terms of global adoption and

    as well. As more businesses begin to accept payments in cryptocurrencies as alternatives
    to conventional forms such as cash or credit card, accounting rules Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for measuring and recording these transactions
    will have to be enumerated. There are no cryptocurrency specific GAAP rules as
    yet. However, the AICPA has attempted to provide some guidance on this issue.
    Cryptocurrencies are not considered “cash or cash equivalents” or “financial instruments”
    or “inventory” on the balance sheet. These can best be classified as “intangible
    assets” with an indefinite life. However, this classification ignores the fact
    that cryptocurrencies are liquid assets like cash.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, intangible assets with indefinite life must be tested for impairment
    annually and, more frequently, if an impairment is suspected, impaired losses
    must be written off. Given the volatility of cryptocurrency markets, this is problematic.
    Vilner [[8](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_008)] reports that in the previous fiscal
    year, “crypto investors had more than $1.7 billion in 2018 reported losses, and
    most of them had no idea how to report losses properly.” Moreover, the crypto
    speculators are struggling in properly reporting their taxable income using the
    BT.

    carrying value), but not gains or recovery of previous losses on intangible assets,
    must be recognized. Alternatively, some have proposed that cryptocurrencies should
    be accounted for as investments. PWC favors a “fair value measurement model, with
    both realized and unrealized changes reflected currently in the income statement,
    which will best represent the economics associated with holding cryptocurrencies
    (Cryptocurrencies: Time to consider plan B, PWC).” The basic argument is that
    the fundamental nature of cryptocurrencies is different from most intangible assets.
    Unlike intangible assets like patents, cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges
    and could be used as payment for goods and services. Information surrounding the
    determination of the fair values of cryptocurrencies is publicly disclosed as
    this information will be useful to stakeholders (cryptocurrencies: time to consider
    plan B). Others have pointed out that “cryptocurrencies are not financial assets
    because they … [lack] ownership interest in an entity, or a contract establishing
    a right or obligation to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument”
    (classification of cryptocurrency holding, Deloitte). Another issue cryptocurrency
    poses in the accounting profession is the evaluation and recording of mining transactions.

    needs to utilize miners to verify the transactions and data transfer. Essentially
    miners validate transactions using high-powered computing to ensure that the data

    have rewarded a segment of the cryptocurrency as payment, with each computer that
    proceeds with the mining process getting an even smaller segment. Davidson [[9](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_009)]
    explains that the proof of work model that mining presents is a type of self-sufficient
    economy as “[blockchain] uses economic incentives to ensure that it keeps going
    and doesn’t go back in time or incur any other glitch” (p. 4). Because miners
    are rewarded for recording transactions, there is an incentive for people to mine
    in their free computing time or to invest in specialized mining equipment to get
    a share of the pie.

    Commission (SEC) and FinCEN treat cryptocurrency as a currency and a property,

    in the auditing and financial viewing of Bitcoin as an asset. According to Barlin

    be sold before it is recognized, the receipt of a bitcoin or other virtual currency
    must be recorded. Furthermore, because bitcoins are treated like real currency,
    their exchange rate at the balance sheet date must be considered, and adjusting
    entries must be made to reflect conversion to U.S. dollars.”

    Notice 2014 [[11](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_011)] states that cryptocurrencies

    should be treated as self-employment, and any the fair value of Bitcoins mined
    should be included in their taxable income [[11](#b_9783110702507-002_ref_011)].
    Providing further guidance on how to calculate income when services are rendered,
    and payment is received in virtual currency, the IRS notes that “the amount of
    income you must recognize is the fair market value of the virtual currency, in
    U.S. dollars when received. In an on-chain transaction, you receive the virtual
    currency on the date, and at the time the transaction is recorded on the distributed

- en: Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize business processes and accounting
    practices. It is more than just Bitcoins. This technology represents a dynamic
    shift in data origination, organization and verification. For accounting firms
    to harness the benefits of this technology, they, along with their clients, will
    need to understand the nuances behind data processes fully. Accountants generally
    expend considerable resources to manage their customer and supplier accounts.
    Similarly, auditors expend significant resources to verify customer and supplier
    account balances. With streamlined supply chains and immutable record of transactions
    related to accounts payable and accounts receivables, BT is likely to reengineer
    a labor-intensive and time-consuming aspect of an audit as it can show whether
    a transaction has occurred. However, BT cannot provide assurance on whether the
    transaction itself can be trusted. The validity of a transaction that the transaction
    actually happened in the real world is another matter. Even the idea that BT can
    replace auditors assumes that the transactions between related parties recorded
    on to blockchains are not fraudulent, unauthorized or due to collusion or side
    agreements. The problems of hidden accounts and off-book or off-chain transactions
    may yet persist. However, internal controls or regulations can remedy that – if
    it is not on the blockchain, it is not included.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    about their client’s operations, which arguably improves governance and transparency.
    The audit function will evolve from one of examining what happened in retrospect
    to that of learning what is happening in real time. Accountants and auditors can
    play an important role in the creation, execution, and continuous monitoring of
    smart contracts and in serving as an arbitrator to settle a dispute among parties
    participating in the blockchain on a private network. Overall, blockchain is a
    disruptive force to be dealt with for a profession that serves many stakeholders
    while tackling more complex transactions ever in a rapidly evolving, technology-driven
    business landscape.
