  zh: 摘要
- en: Quantum computers will make it possible to solve problems faster and more effectively
    than conventional computers currently can. Commercial quantum computers might
    be available in the next several years. Performing quantum operations on quantum
    registers is crucial to the building blocks of a quantum computing system. When
    these events occur in a system, they result in something fundamentally different
    from what you expect from a computer system. Using quantum physics, it is feasible
    that some computer jobs may be done more rapidly than they would be if the tasks
    were conducted using conventional Boolean logic and classical computers. This
    work discussed the recent developments and in-depth state of the art literature
    in Quantum Computing (QC) and related areas. This work primarily focuses on core
    concepts of Quantum computing such as Quantum mechanics, quantum gates, and quantum
    circuits, which serve as pillars for Quantum Computing and Quantum Information.
    Further, the QC-based concepts are implemented using a case study. The case study
    explores quantum computing techniques to address a real-life financial problem
    QAOA on IBM's Quantum Computer using Qiskit.

  zh: 1 介绍
- en: In 1981, “Quantum computing (QC)” was coined during MIT's First Conference on
    the Physics of Computation when Paul Beniff and Richard Feynman discussed it [[1](#CR1)].
    Following the meeting, several researchers such as Peter Shor, Lov Grover, David
    Deutsch, and Richard Jozsa contributed to the development of quantum computing
    with ground-breaking work such as Grover's, Shor's, and Deutsch–Jozsa algorithms.
    This sector was not yet in the spotlight and was not widely recognized. Still,
    in the fourth quarter of 2019, when Google declared its quantum computing dominance
    on October 23, 2019, the term “Quantum Computer” became a buzzword on the internet
    [[1](#CR1)]. On December 9, 2020, India's DRDO successfully established a secure
    connection using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which is an essential experiment
    for establishing a secure connection for military communication purposes [[1](#CR1)].
    Quantum computers refer to the combination of two different technologies used
    to compute tasks that are not possible or complex to solve using classical computers
    but can be solved using quantum computers. This combination of Quantum mechanics
    principles with Computers potentially computes complex tasks in less time and
    with greater accuracy. Complex tasks that take a long time to compute on a supercomputer
    can be completed quickly and easily on quantum computers. The foundation of quantum
    computing can be found in the scientific field of quantum mechanics, also known
    as the universe's operating system. The operational working of quantum computing
    differs from classical computing; quantum computing works on qubits, whereas classical
    computing works on bits. To explain in a simplified way, the bit can be thought
    of as a switch on a plug whose function is to turn on or off the bulb. In contrast,
    the Qubit can be thought of as a regulator or thermostat on a ceiling fan or air
    conditioner that can control the speed and temperature. In technical terms, the
    quantum computer operates on Qubits which can have more values than 0 s and 1 s,
    which classical bits have due to which the probabilities and output can be different
    [[2](#CR2), [3](#CR3)].

- en: Quantum computers have the potential to circumvent traditional blockchain security
    procedures. Instead of depending on conventional information, it would be better
    to use a blockchain that is solely based on quantum information. Consequently,
    the QKD layer and quantum advantages over a conventional blockchain may be established
    [[4](#CR4)]. In Quantum Blockchain (QB)-based networks, the concept of a chain
    can be utilized to describe a Bitcoin-like network because quantum systems contain
    the feature of entanglement, which is unique to quantum systems. Quantum systems
    are described as information carriers because they encode and decode data as they
    move across space and time. Even in financial services, quantum systems, blockchain,
    and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have become more popular in recent
    years. Due to the rapid growth of quantum computing, Grover and Shor's methods
    may now be used in attacks. Post-quantum systems, which are resistant to quantum
    entanglement, are included in this category. Blockchain technology relies heavily
    on the use of hash functions, which enable digital signatures and the linking
    of blocks. Public-key cryptosystems and hash functions, among other things, are
    at risk from quantum computers. This technique might one day enable quantum computers
    the ability to re-create the whole blockchain in a fraction of the time it now
    takes [[5](#CR5)]. Table [1](#Tab1) shows the comparative analysis of various
    recent studies in QC and QB fields. This comparative analysis of studies shows
    different important domains (quantum blockchain, performance issues, hardware
    and simulation designs, research challenges discussions) in recent studies. Figure [1](#Fig1)
    shows an overview of QB. Here, blockchain and quantum computing aspects are discussed.
    The important concepts in QB include smart contract, consensus algorithms, distributed
    ledger, and mining. Here, the advantages and features of QB and its related concepts
    are visualized. Likewise, QC concepts including quantum mechanics, quantum hardware,
    quantum algorithms and mathematics are briefly explored.Table 1

  zh: 量子计算机有可能绕过传统的区块链安全程序。与其依赖传统信息不如使用完全基于量子信息的区块链更好。因此，可以建立量子密钥分发（QKD）层和量子优势相比传统区块链
    [[4](#CR4)]。在基于量子区块链（QB）的网络中，可以利用链的概念来描述类似比特币的网络，因为量子系统具有量子纠缠的特性，这是量子系统独有的。量子系统被描述为信息载体，因为它们在时空中移动时对数据进行编码和解码。即使在金融服务领域，量子系统、区块链和其他分布式账本技术（DLTs）近年来也变得更加流行。由于量子计算的迅速增长，Grover
    和 Shor 的方法现在可能被用于攻击。抗量子纠缠的后量子系统被归类到这一类别中。区块链技术在很大程度上依赖于哈希函数的使用，这些函数可以实现数字签名和区块的链接。公钥密码系统和哈希函数等技术都受到量子计算机的威胁。这种技术可能有一天会使量子计算机能够在极短时间内重新创建整个区块链
    [[5](#CR5)]。表 [1](#Tab1) 显示了量子计算（QC）和量子区块链（QB）领域的各种最近研究的比较分析。这些研究的比较分析显示了最近研究中不同的重要领域（量子区块链、性能问题、硬件和仿真设计、研究挑战讨论）。图

  zh: 2 量子计算
- en: Quantum computing is a revolutionary computer paradigm that exploits the fabric
    of reality to tackle security issues that previously could not be solved. Quantum
    computing is based on quantum mechanics, the strange and paradoxical physical
    principles that govern subatomic scales, where things can simultaneously exist
    in several places or states. Quantum computing uses new computing paradigms to
    exploit quantum features of qubits such as superposition, interference, and entanglement
    [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)]. The quantum theory of information states that every
    qubit has the potential to be in a state of superposition between the two values
    0 and 1 at any given point in time. In order to make use of the idea of superposition,
    a single qubit may perform two different calculations at the same time. In accordance
    with the concept, quantum computers with larger qubits have the ability to do
    more calculations per second than conventional computers. It is possible that
    a quantum computer with sufficient computational capability may be able to break
    the encryption used to protect blockchains, according to theoretical simulations.
    Thus, QB is used to protect the blockchain from quantum attacks.

    [10](#CR10)]。量子信息理论表明每个量子比特在任何给定时间点都有可能处于0和1两个值之间的叠加状态。为了利用叠加的概念，单个量子比特可以同时执行两个不同的计算。根据这个概念，具有更大量子比特的量子计算机每秒可以做更多的计算比传统计算机。根据理论模拟，有可能具有足够计算能力的量子计算机能够破解用于保护区块链的加密。因此，QB用于保护区块链免受量子攻击。

- en: Rather than using 1 s and 0 s, quantum computers perform calculations based
    on the likelihood of an object's condition before it is measured, allowing them
    to analyze exponentially more data than ordinary computers. Traditional computers
    execute logical operations based on the position of a physical object in space.
    As a result of their limited operability, these devices are often binary. When
    you think about it, a bit is simply a single state such as on, off, up, down,
    and 1 or 0\. To generate a qubit, operations in quantum computing use an item's
    quantum state. For example, a coin's spin, or the spin of an electron in technical
    words, are undefined features of an object that have yet to be recognized. As
    a coin spins in the air before landing in your hand, unmeasured quantum states
    exist in a state of mixed ‘superposition’ rather than having a definite position
    in space. There is a possibility that these superpositions will be mathematically
    connected to those of other objects, even though we don't know what they are at
    this point. Unsolved states of “spinning coins” can be used to create custom algorithms
    that solve problems that would take a standard computer a long time or never solve.
    In addition to solving challenging mathematical problems, these algorithms could
    be used to create difficult-to-crack security codes and predict the interactions
    of many particles in chemical reactions [[11](#CR11)]. The distributed digital
    ledger technology known as blockchain, which is held on a network of computers,
    is becoming more popular. In the near future, quantum computing will make it impossible
    to secure a system built on the blockchain architecture. Computations performed
    by ordinary computers today would take many, many years to be completed by quantum
    computers. Using QKD, you can identify whether a third party is listening in on
    secure data transfers. In the event of an attack, a quantum key-encrypted blockchain
    network may be more secure than a regular network.

    1 或 0。为了生成量子位，量子计算中的操作使用物品的量子状态。例如，一个硬币的旋转，或者技术上的电子自旋，是尚未被识别的对象的未定义特征。当一个硬币在空中旋转然后落在你手中时，未测量的量子状态存在于混合的“叠加”状态中，而不是在空间中具有明确的位置。这些叠加态有可能与其他对象的叠加态在数学上相连，尽管在这一点上我们不知道它们是什么。未解决的“旋转硬币”状态可以用来创建定制算法，解决需要很长时间或永远无法解决的标准计算机的问题。除了解决具有挑战性的数学问题外，这些算法还可以用于创建难以破解的安全代码，并预测化学反应中许多粒子的相互作用[[11](#CR11)]。分布式数字分类账技术称为区块链，存储在计算机网络上，变得越来越流行。在不久的将来，量子计算将使基于区块链架构的系统无法保护。今天普通计算机执行的计算将需要很多很多年才能被量子计算机完成。使用量子密钥分发（QKD），您可以确定第三方是否监听了安全数据传输。在遭受攻击时，量子密钥加密的区块链网络可能比常规网络更安全。

    blocks of superconducting qubits. Using quantum computers, information may be
    stored [[13](#CR13)]. The flux, charge, and junction phase of these devices are
    quantized at millikelvin temperatures. These devices provide a wide range of benefits,
    including scalability, microwave compatibility, and nanosecond-scale operation.
    Using the features of each state, it is feasible to separate a qubit into two
    distinct states. The charge qubit, the phase qubit, and the flux qubit are all
    types of superconducting qubits. The superconducting Qubit-based quantum computer
    is one of the most popular and widely used systems approaches currently investigated
    by big IT giants like IBM and Google. Due to its heavy structure, the superconducting
    Qubit quantum computer resembles a chandelier. The superconducting Qubit is made
    using microfabrication, similar to the elements found in today's modern computer,
    which uses silicon fabrication in chips and devices. Copper generates this Qubit.
    This computer is kept in a cryogenic refrigerator at −0℃ to avoid qubit errors
    that could lead to miscalculation or incorrect results. These computers are based
    on the quantum mechanics principle called superposition. Superconducting qubit-based
    computers are faster and built on the existing semiconductor industry. On the
    other hand, it requires a much lower temperature to work and is easily collapsed
    [[14](#CR14)]. In a recent study [[15](#CR15)], it has been shown that quantum
    computers may be able to compromise the signature process of Bitcoin in as little
    as 10 min. According to some projections, the availability of a quantum computer
    strong enough to break the protocol may be possible by 2027\. It is possible that
    an attacker will take advantage of this situation in order to steal bitcoins from
    the account used by introducing fake transactions into the current block of transactions.
    Considering that superconducting qubits are notoriously sluggish, it's impossible
    to use more than 2300 or 2440 logical qubits in a quantum computer in order to
    achieve the same level of speed in both attacks. By the year 2023, it is expected
    that quantum computers will have between 100 and 500 processors, depending on
    the model. Using a NISQ computer in conjunction with traditional pre-processing
    to generate quantum factors, the Variational Quantum Factoring (VQF) method, which
    is a version of Shor's technique, builds quantum factors.

- en: Blockchain and Quantum computers have the potential to have a long-term influence
    on computing and business by addressing computational problems that are now unsolvable
    [[16](#CR16)]. There are 160 storage qubits and 79 processor qubits in one of
    the most sophisticated quantum computers currently available on the market. It's
    possible that a new game dubbed “Quantum Supremacy” may be released soon. One
    proposed technique for a large-scale quantum computer is a trapped ion quantum
    computer. Electromagnetic fields can confine and suspend ions, or charged atomic
    particles, in free space. Quantum information can be conveyed by the collective
    quantized motion of the ions in a shared trap, and qubits are stored in stable
    electronic states of each ion. Lasers are used to produce coupling between qubit
    states (for single-qubit operations) or between internal qubit states and exterior
    emotional states (for multi-qubit operations). In trapped ion systems, the fundamental
    operations of a quantum computer have been demonstrated experimentally with the
    best accuracy currently available. Transporting ions to spatially distinct locations
    in an array of ion traps, building large entangled states via photonically connected
    networks of remotely entangled ion chains, and combinations of these two ideas
    are among the promising schemes in development to scale the system to arbitrarily
    large numbers of qubits. As a result, one of the best architectures for a scalable,
    universal quantum computer is the trapped ion quantum computer system, which means
    the single trapped ion computer can be connected to another trapped ion computer
    in the grid format, increasing the number of qubits. The most significant number
    of particles to be controllably entangled as of April 2018 is 20 trapped ions.
    Trapped ion quantum computers differ from superconducting qubits as they are kept
    in a vacuum tube in zero space, eliminating the need for cryogenic freezers as
    shown in Fig. [2](#Fig2). As a result, quantum computers are small in size, mimicking
    a cupboard. Also, this approach uses the entanglement principle of quantum mechanics.
    The main advantage of trapped ions is that they are highly stable and can achieve
    high gate fidelity. The drawback of this type is that its operation is slow, and
    procedure requires multiple lasers [[17](#CR17), [18](#CR18)].![](../images/516210_1_En_11_Chapter/516210_1_En_11_Fig2_HTML.png)

    steps. Its Laser lights are first channelled into four mirroring resonators, tiny
    circular tracks in which light loops around and changes shape as it catches its
    tail (as shown in Fig. [3](#Fig3)). These resonators function as “squeezers,”
    compressing many photons into a single compressed state. The photons’ attributes
    are then manipulated via a network of optical devices, like changing their direction
    by bouncing them off a mirror or changing their colour by passing them through
    a filter. The equivalent of computer code is the sequences of these gentle manipulations.
    When light bounces or rotates around the network, it performs operations analogous
    to adding ones and zeroes in a traditional computer. The light then passes via
    a detector, which counts the number of photons in each compressed condition. These
    photon numbers are the result of the computer''s calculations [[19](#CR19)]. Since
    both computers are stored in a sealed pack vacuum casing, the approach is similar
    to trapped ions. The primary difference between the two is that photonic quantum
    computers are based on two quantum mechanics principles: superposition and entanglement.
    As a result, the number of qubits can be increased by connecting them to other
    quantum computers. Computers of this sort are used to solve chemistry, finance,
    and logistics issues. Linear optical gates can be integrated on-chip into photonic
    qubit quantum computers and scaled to a very high degree over time. The main drawback
    of this type of system is photon loss.![](../images/516210_1_En_11_Chapter/516210_1_En_11_Fig3_HTML.png)'

    Information is encoded in bits in traditional computing, with each bit having
    a value of zero or one. Data is encoded in qubits in quantum computing. A qubit
    is a two-level quantum system with the states |0> and |1> as the two primary qubit
    states. A qubit can be either in |0> or |1> state or a linear combination of both
    states (unlike a classical bit). Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computing.
    As you may know, classical computing is based on the bit, which can be either
    a one or a zero. A qubit, like a bit, is the smallest unit of quantum information.
    A qubit, unlike a bit, can represent a lot more than just ones and zeros. Every
    obfuscation distorts the truth. Let's look at a graphic representation of the
    Qubit to see why it has so much more representative ability than a traditional
    bit (see Fig. [6](#Fig6)). Consider a sphere. A conventional bit can only take
    the value of its north or south pole, which is either 0 or 1 [[29](#CR29)].![](../images/516210_1_En_11_Chapter/516210_1_En_11_Fig6_HTML.png)

- en: In light of the fact that quantum computers are capable of decrypting cryptographic
    algorithms, it is quite probable that the cryptographic techniques that are now
    employed to protect (classical) blockchains will be decrypted in the future. A
    blockchain that is intrinsically quantum in nature and that is entirely constituted
    of quantum data, on the other hand, would be a preferable option. Consequently,
    in addition to the advantages of a QKD layer, the possibility of quantum advantages
    over a regular blockchain protocol would be realised [[4](#CR4)]. Rajan and Visser
    [[4](#CR4)] have shown that the functioning of a quantum blockchain network outperforms
    that of a standard network in terms of speed and efficiency. All of the assumptions
    made in this research were based on the assumption that freshly constructed blocks
    remained in the same GHZ state as they were when they were originally formed.
    Obtaining valid blocks in a decentralised way, as mentioned above, is the aim
    of this condition, just as it is the goal of the conventional case. As previously
    stated, the possibility of fraud exists due to the possibility that the network
    contains dishonest nodes, as well as the possibility that the blocks that are
    created were generated by a dishonest source as well. When untrusted parties utilise
    blockchain technology to trade a potential block (also known as an n-qubit state),
    the block is verified by the system's central node, which is then exchanged again
    between untrusted parties. Given the current state of affairs, it is permissible
    to distribute as many copies of the block as is necessary without violating the
    no cloning theorem. Given the current state of affairs, it is permissible to distribute
    as many copies of the block as is necessary without violating the no cloning theorem.
    This is due to the fact that it is aware of the present situation, which is the
    case. Because cryptographic hash algorithms are used, only the blocks after the
    altered block are destroyed, resulting in the system being susceptible to errors.
    This is the most often seen situation. For the purpose of creating a quantum version
    of the system, the critical functionality of time-stamped blocks and hash functions
    was removed and replaced with a temporal GHZ state that is capable of exhibiting
    both spatial and temporal entanglement. These states beat anything that a classical
    system could ever do in terms of correlation with a single spatial GHZ state due
    to the great amount of correlation that exists between these states. If an attacker
    attempted to tamper with even a single photon in this scenario, he would be required
    to invalidate the whole local copy of the blockchain, which would be impossible.
    Compared to entanglement in space, which in this case just invalidates the future
    blocks of the tampered block and provides no further security protection, this
    technique provides a significant amount of additional security protection.

    which will be the subject of future research, to conduct a rigorous case-by-case
    investigation of any tampering with the final classical measurement data, which
    will be the focus of future research. As a result of the fact that numerous well-known
    blockchains, such as previous versions of the Hyperledger fabric [[4](#CR4)],
    do not offer Byzantine fault tolerance, it has been established as a precedent
    that Byzantine fault tolerance is not necessary in order to propose unique blockchain
    design. It is anticipated that this data format will be used as the foundation
    for further research into quantum network consensus algorithms, which will most
    likely take place in the not-too-distant future, as well as for additional applications
    at some point in the future. It is nonsensical to attempt to offer complete security
    proofs for Byzantine fault tolerance in quantum architecture, especially in light
    of the uncertain position that happens in the usual state of things. However,
    rather of relying on the use of simultaneous coexistence, we were able to arrive
    at our conclusions via the use of entanglement between photons that did not have
    the same nonclassical measurement correlations but did have nonclassical measurement
    correlations in other ways. Despite the fact that the most recent photon has not
    yet been discovered, there is a possibility that the physical description of the
    first photon discovered in the past will be changed as a consequence of measuring
    the most recently discovered photon. It is essential to think about quantum blockchain
    encoding strategy in the following manner in order to fully appreciate it: it
    connects the current records in a block to an actual record in the future rather
    than to a record from a previous block.'

    accepts appends. It is referred to as a distributed ledger system because it integrates
    the procedures for achieving agreement on data in the setting of a huge decentralised
    network. One of the most well-known uses of Blockchain technology is its ability
    to create and maintain the existence of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which
    is one of the most well-known examples. Other applications of blockchain technology
    include the development of self-executing “smart contracts,” which are protocols
    for the execution of trustworthy transactions without the involvement of a third
    party. Blockchain technology has also been applied to the development of smart
    contracts. In order to update the chain, the nodes who desire to contribute new
    data to it must commence the process of updating the chain on their own (either
    new transactions or new messages). Blockchain updates are transmitted to all miners
    via conventional channels, but the quantum data associated with a blockchain update
    is disseminated to all miners using quantum channels. In order to continue with
    a Byzantine agreement protocol, each miner must first determine whether or not
    the update has been accepted in his or her own way before progressing. In [[7](#CR7)],
    which is based on quantum mechanics, presents a straightforward voting process
    that is simple to comprehend. A blockchain that is anonymous, binding, and non-reusable
    is currently being developed, and it will allow for fair and self-tallying verifiable
    voting, as well as self-verification of votes. As a result, everyone is looking
    at the possibility of using quantum blockchain technology to other types of enterprises
    in the future, such as virtual reality and quantum auctions and lotteries [[7](#CR7)].
    It is a strong belief that Quantum Blockchain technology will also simplify the

    to do this. For the simple reason that it is time-consuming and costly to detect

    case. Grover's algorithm is a solution to the issue of constructing a pre-image
    of a SHA-256 function's value that is difficult to invert, which is a tough challenge
    to solve. When compared to the standard collision search method, the hash collision
    search approach would be far more efficient than brute force searching in terms

    modems utilised are situated in secure locations that prevent any unintended information
    leakage from occurring. It is feasible to perform energy-efficient mining on a
    consortium blockchain, which has been built, by using an interactive mining protocol
    for the Ethereum blockchain, which has been developed. In order to achieve maximum
    network efficiency, it is anticipated that the consortium acts in the best interests
    of the network as a whole via the design, which will be subject to stringent criteria
    and requirements. This work examines a variety of applications that make use of
    a quantum–secure authentication protocol, such as authenticating clients, hardware,
    and communication channels, protecting against a Sybil attack, and detecting tampering
    with hardware.'

    of cryptocurrency that is inspired by both Bitcoin and quantum physics at the
    same time. Using a revolutionary two-stage quantum mining technique, which is
    discussed in depth, the mining of the world's first distributed quantum money
    has been made possible. A innovative, two-stage quantum mining strategy, which
    is explained in this paper, is one of the tools that are supplied in this article
    to aid in the mining process. The advantages over conventional Bitcoin include
    counterfeit resistance, completely anonymous and free transactions, as well as
    a lighter carbon footprint than standard Bitcoin transactions. Like this approach,
    other quantum-enabled cryptocurrencies can be designed [[4](#CR4)].

    to handle issues as quickly or effectively as quantum computers will be able to
    do in the future, owing to the limitations of current technology. According to
    some estimations, commercial quantum computers will be available for purchase
    within a few years of their development. When constructing the basic building
    blocks of a quantum computing system, it is imperative that the ability to conduct
    quantum operations on quantum registers be shown. Every time one of these events
    takes place in a computer system, the result is something that is diametrically
    opposed to what you would expect from a computer system in the great majority
    of cases. If some computer tasks were performed using quantum mechanics rather
    than ordinary Boolean logic and classical computers, it is possible that they
    might be done more rapidly, although this is not a given conclusion at this time.
    An in-depth assessment of the most recent state-of-the-art literature in these
    domains of research was also included in this article, which addressed recently
    published advances in QC and related fields of research. All of these topics are
    the major focus of this research since they reflect the foundational principles
    of quantum computing that serve as the foundation for both quantum computing and
    quantum information research and development. QC and quantum information are founded
    on the fundamental notions of quantum computing, such as quantum physics, quantum
    gates, and quantum circuits. In addition, the foundations of quality control are
    shown and put into practise, among other things, via the use of a case study.
    In Case study, the use of quantum computing technology to a real-world financial
    problem is the focus of this article. Qiskit was used to run QAOA on IBM's Quantum
    Computer, which is a quantum computer. Qiskit is a quantum computing system. Finally,
    Importance, recent advancements and future directions of QB are explored.

    is necessary to calculate hashes. Because of this, the blockchain is reliant on
    the hash algorithm's robustness. It's not recommended since it's time-consuming
    and costly to check for a collision with an already-existing hash in this case.
    To tackle the exceedingly tough challenge of constructing a pre-image of a SHA-256
    function's value that is impossible to invert. As a consequence, it's vital to
    figure out whether adding a new block to the chain won't break the chain's overall
    sequential consistency because of it. As time goes on, these and other concerns
    will be examined in more detail.

    from being cracked by quantum computers, and it is referred to as QKD. The QKD
    developed by Rajan and Visser may also be referred in a quantum blockchain. Even
    though they are still in the early stages of research, these technologies may
    be valuable in the event of a quantum computer assault. Thus, efficient QKD approaches
    can be explored, designed and tested in future.

    using a blockchain consortium, which has already been developed and is now undergoing
    testing, according to one of the blockchain consortiums [[20](#CR20)]. Rather
    than working just for its own personal gain, it is hoped that the consortium would
    act in the best interests of the network as a whole, in order to achieve the maximum
    possible degree of efficiency and effectiveness throughout the whole network.
    It is assumed that a number of severe rules and criteria would be followed throughout
    the design process in order to achieve success. In future, attempts could be made
    to evaluate a number of applications that make use of a quantum–secure authentication
    system in order to determine whether or not they are economically feasible in
    the future or not. Likewise, quantum-memory issues may be taken-up for its integration
    with blockchain or quantum networks [[26](#CR26)].
