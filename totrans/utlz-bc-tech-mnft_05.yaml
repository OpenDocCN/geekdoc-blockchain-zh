- en: Blockchain technology (BCT), which has been around since bitcoins in 2009, has
    matured to the point where it is suitable for a wide range of applications. In
    the current literature, BCT is frequently referred to as a disruptive technology
    and an innovation capable of disrupting business processes, abruptly postponing
    opportunities for action in companies, and radically changing business models
    (Pavithran et al., 2020). With that in mind, BCT, a decentralized record that
    works with exchanges of cryptographed information in blocks, has provoked scholastic
    and business curiosity because of its capacity to confirm, review, and ensure
    communicated information and data (Bamakan et al., 2020; Gokalp et al., 2019).

    because it can work with complex communications among network partners and address
    the issue of information irregularities (Shin, 2019). As indicated by reports,
    roughly 62% of SC leaders have utilized BCT, and the normal business esteem added
    by this Industry 4.0 constituent innovation will surpass US$3.1 trillion by 2030
    (Wamba & Queiroz, 2020). The BCT is a distributed system that maintains a consistent,
    unchanging, and chronological chain of transactions between network participants
    (Mukherjee et al., 2022a). Due to the shared organization of the BCT, there are
    no mediators between the players; accordingly, makers or providers in a coordination’s
    chain can manage their clients (Coita et al., 2019; Grover et al., 2019). Trust
    is a fundamental part of business connections among outsiders, and trust is an
    innate part of the BCT agreement component (Hijazi et al., 2019; S. Yadav & Singh,
    2020).

    objectives such as cost, quality, speed, reliability, risk reduction, sustainability,
    and flexibility (Makhdoom et al., 2019; Sunny et al., 2020; Yusof et al., 2018).
    In any case, it is muddled what impact BCT will have on coordination’s chain jobs
    and errands and which go-between charges BCT will cause (Pal et al., 2021a). Players
    in a coordination’s chain should battle with new players and capacities and the
    deficiency of long-haul colleagues. Maintaining a functional SC necessitates comprehension
    and transparency regarding the shifting roles and processes caused by BCT (Beck
    et al., 2017; Macrinici et al., 2018; Marsal-Llacuna, 2018). To achieve this,
    we led an audit of the writing to record and dissect the overall errands of a
    go-between (Longo et al., 2019; Sheel & Nath, 2019).

    Factory of the Future, however, is set to look very different as technology such
    as BCT, AI, and machine learning gain traction (Fosso Wamba et al., 2020; Kamble
    et al., 2019; Latif et al., 2021; Wong et al., 2020). As BCT develops, makers
    will actually want to defeat a portion of the hindrances to huge scope arrangement
    of other cutting edge advancements and creative plans of action (Cole et al.,
    2019; Vafadarnikjoo et al., 2021). Subsequently, more proficient industrial facility
    tasks will arise, requiring information sharing and coordinated effort across
    complex organizations of organizations and machines. This will be the new business
    standard (Chen et al., 2020; Dolgui et al., 2020; Dubey et al., 2020).

    and the following of resources in a business organization. An unmistakable resource
    (like a house, vehicle, money, or land) can likewise be theoretical (licensed
    innovation, licenses, copyrights, marking). Basically, anything of significant
    worth can be followed and exchanged on a BCT organization, bringing down hazard
    and bringing down costs for all gatherings included. A BCT is an assortment of
    information coordinated into individual squares put away on the entirety of clients'
    PCs (Bosu et al., 2019; Ikeda & Hamid, 2018; Tönnissen & Teuteberg, 2018). This
    data segmentation into blocks yields a chain-like sequence that reflects the course
    of transactions (Kshetri, 2018; Lim et al., 2021). Cryptographic methods are used
    to protect the data blocks from subsequent changes, resulting in a gapless chain
    of linked data blocks over time (Kulkarni & Patil, 2020; Saurabh & Dey, 2021).
    The consensus mechanism is used to agree on the correct state of data on the BCT
    network among all BCT network participants (Dinh et al., 2018; Dwivedi et al.,
    2020; Queiroz et al., 2019).

    and all the more exactly it is gotten, the better. BCT is great for conveying
    that data since it gives moment, shared, and totally straightforward information
    put away on an unchanging record that main organization individuals with consent
    can get to (Babich & Hilary, 2020; Hijazi et al., 2019; Nakamoto, 2008). A BCT
    organization can follow orders, instalments, records, creation, and significantly
    more. Since individuals share a solitary perspective on reality, you can see all
    subtleties of an exchange from start to finish, giving you more prominent certainty
    and new efficiencies and openings. Every exchange is recorded as a “block” of
    information as it happens (Di Vaio & Varriale, 2020; Queiroz et al., 2020; Sheel
    & Nath, 2019; L. W. Wong, Leong, et al., 2020).

    resource (scholarly) (Pal et al., 2021b). The information square can store any
    data you need, including who, what, when, where, how much, and surprisingly a
    shipment's condition, like temperature. Each block is linked to the ones that
    came before and after it (Cole et al., 2019; Dwivedi et al., 2020; Francisco &
    Swanson, 2018; Verhoeven et al., 2018). These squares structure an information
    chain as a resource move starting with one area then onto the next or proprietorship
    changes hands (Mukherjee et al., 2021b). The squares affirm the exact time and
    grouping of exchanges and are safely connected together to keep any square from
    being changed or embedded between two different squares (Mathivathanan et al.,
    2021; Schlecht et al., 2021; Viriyasitavat et al., 2020). In a BCT, exchanges
    are connected in an irreversible chain. Each extra square fortifies the past square's
    check and consequently the whole BCT. The BCT becomes tamper-evident. As a result,
    they delivered immutability's critical strength (Dolgui et al., 2020; Makhdoom
    et al., 2019; Yadav & Singh, 2020). This wipes out the chance of malevolent entertainer
    altering and makes a confided in record of exchanges for yourself and other organization
    individuals (Treiblmaier, 2018; Wu et al., 2019). You can believe that as an individual
    from an individual’s just organization, you will get exact and convenient information
    from the BCT and that your secret BCT records will be shared distinctly with network
    individuals to whom you have explicitly allowed admittance (Mukherjee & Chittipaka,
    2021b). All organization individuals should concede to the precision of the information,
    and all approved exchanges are unchanging in light of the fact that they are recorded
    for all time (Gokalp et al., 2019; Kshetri, 2018; Wong, Tan, et al., 2020). A
    transaction cannot be deleted by anyone, not even the system administrator. Time-consuming
    record reconciliations are eliminated with a distributed ledger shared among network
    members (Alazab et al., 2020; S. E. Chang & Chen, 2020; Dutta et al., 2020).

    Significant computational power is required, there is little or no privacy for
    transactions, and security is weak (Durach et al., 2020; Saberi et al., 2019;
    van Hoek, 2019). These are critical contemplations for BCT use cases in the venture.
    A private BCT network is a decentralized shared organization, like a public BCT
    organization. Be that as it may, the organization is administered by a solitary
    association, which figures out who is permitted to partake, carries out an agreement
    convention, and keeps up with the common record (Aslam et al., 2021; Koh et al.,
    2020; Tipmontian et al., 2020). Contingent upon the utilization case, this can
    altogether build member trust and certainty. A private BCT can be utilized in
    the background of an organization (Chang et al., 2018; Helo & Hao, 2019; Yadav
    et al., 2020).

    is the most well-known consensus mechanism in which the computer must execute
    a complex mathematical algorithm (Banerjee, 2018; Filimonau & Naumova, 2020; Gökalp
    et al., 2020). Solely after effective execution can another information block
    on the BCT be produced, which should be approved by different PC in the distributed
    organization prior to being remembered for the BCT (Mukherjee et al., 2021). Notwithstanding
    the information, squares comprises of a timestamp and the past square's hash esteem.
    To shield the squares from ensuing changes, cryptographic strategies are utilized,
    bringing about a nonstop chain of connected information blocks over the long haul
    (Clohessy et al., 2019; Korpela et al., 2017; Sheel & Nath, 2019).

    As an item drops down the worth chain (from creation to utilization), the information
    produced at each progression can be archived as an exchange, making a long-lasting
    history of the item. BCT can successfully add to I recording each and every resource
    (from improvement to compartments) as it moves through the SC hubs, (ii) following
    requests, receipts, solicitations, instalments, and some other authority report;
    and (iii) following computerized resources (like guarantees, certificates, copyrights,

    maintainability decreased mistakes and deferrals, lower transportation costs,
    quicker issue distinguishing proof, expanded trust (customer and accomplice trust),
    and further developed item transport and stock administration. The SC is clear
    with BCT (Alazab et al., 2020; Bai and Sarkis, 2020; Filimonau and Naumova, 2020).
    It is considered to show the development of merchandise both spatially and transiently
    all through different stages and cycles of the SC, starting with the state of
    being of the transfer at some random time and advancing through various varieties
    of the products (e.g., temperature deviations) and supporting coordination’s dynamic.
    The influence of BCT is becoming more prevalent as factories worldwide become
    increasingly interconnected (Casino et al., 2019; Kshetri, 2017). Manufacturers
    face a more significant challenge than ever before in securely sharing data inside
    and outside the factory walls. BCT can scale transparency and trust throughout
    the industrial value chain (Casino et al., 2019; Grover et al., 2019; Tapscott
    & Kaplan, 2019).'

    maintenance times, can be supported by BCT (Andoni et al., 2019; Zhao et al.,
    2019). These improvements are important to deal with the expanded intricacy and
    mechanical refinement of cutting-edge producing hardware. Users append each device's
    service agreements and installation documentation to the BCT record, resulting
    in a digital twin that facilitates outsourced maintenance. BCT can then be used
    to automate the execution and payment of scheduled maintenance (Onik et al., 2019;
    Zhang et al., 2018). At the point when a machine needs administration, it can
    create a help demand and a shrewd agreement for the work or a new part. When the
    request has been satisfied, instalment handling happens consequently. Moreover,
    the BCT record incorporates permanent documentation of the upkeep history. These
    applications, which are as yet in the beginning phases of advancement, further
    develop gear unwavering quality, make hardware wellbeing and steady loss checking
    simpler to oversee and make auditable wellbeing appraisals of apparatus (Di Vaio

    a difference in BCT acceptance in the logistics sector between the US and India,
    which should be considered when designing BCT-based global SC. Hughes et al. (2019)
    contrast the UN Sustainable Development Goals with the capabilities of BCT in
    their literature review to demonstrate the benefits of BCT in achieving those
    goals. To investigate the impact of BCT on the SC, Wang et al. (2019) conducted
    interviews with SC experts. Yusof et al. (2018) studied a successful BCT-enabled
    e-commerce platform in a conglomerate and concluded that BCT allows companies
    to issue cryptocurrency while protecting sensitive data (Roy & Giduturi, 2019).

    can upset the manner in which makers configuration, designer, assembling, and
    scale their items. Besides, it is reworking how organizations connect because
    of cultivating trust among contenders who should team up inside particular environments.
    BCT-based arrangements can flawlessly total the entirety of this information,
    offering critical benefit to modern organizations and aiding completely understanding

    machine-level checking and administration, BCT can empower a totally new assembling
    plan of action (Casino et al., 2019; Y. Chang et al., 2020). All manufacturing
    businesses rely on SC (Baral & Verma, 2021). To improve efficiency, most of them

    systems research, case study research is the most common type of qualitative research.
    It is widely used and can provide information that other methods cannot (Rowley,
    2002). Empirical studies on real-world phenomena are conducted using case study
    research (Rose et al., 2014) instead of laboratory or experiment. The primary
    advantages of case study research are that phenomena are studied in their natural
    setting, and theories can be generated from practice. We conducted multiple case
    studies to ensure that our research findings were meaningful. The results become
    more robust as the number of cases increases (Rowley, 2002) and provide a more
    solid foundation for developing theories (Yin, 1994). The selection of cases for
    case study research is a significant challenge (Baral et al., 2021). However,
    it should be borne in mind that pragmatic and logistical reasons also guide the
    selection of topics. We selected four manufacturing firms from India. We conducted
    three interviews for each manufacturing firm in our sample: one with the SC manager,
    IT manager, and procurement manager. An open-ended questionnaire was developed
    for the semi-structured interview format to adjust our questions to the respondents''

    detailed cross-analysis of the case study. The first question was whether the
    company had adopted BCT and its technology in their systems. Company B and C already
    use BCT in their plans, but companies A and D are not using BCT in their SC areas.
    The second question was whether the employees are ready to adopt the latest technology
    and there is no change resistance among the employees. It was found that the employees
    of company A, company B, and company C do not have any kind of change resistance
    and are ready to adopt the latest technologies like BCT. But on the other hand,
    the employees of company D are not prepared to assume any newest technology as
    they have fear in their mind regarding changes that will occur after the innovation
    adoption.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third question was whether the employees had any prior knowledge or training
    about BCT and related technologies. The employees of company A and company D do
    not have adequate knowledge about BCT, so they require proper training about BCT
    to implement their learning. The employees of company B have prior knowledge and
    training about BCT and its related technology. The employees of company C are
    going through the training process in the areas of BCT. The fourth question was
    asked whether the top management is supporting the adoption of BCT or not. It
    was found that the ultimate direction of company A, company B, and company C are
    very much supportive of innovation adoption, especially BCT.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, the top management of company D is not supporting BCT adoption
    in their systems. The fifth question that was asked was regarding cost and its
    impact on BCT adoption. Company A and B agreed that the price is not an issue
    in adopting BCT and related technology. But The responses of company C and company
    D were opposite as they decided that cost would be an issue in adopting BCT and
    its technology. The sixth question was asked regarding IT infrastructure in the
    company. Company A and company B responded that there is adequate IT infrastructure
    in the company. Still, company D responded that the three lacks sufficient infrastructure
    in the company, and company C responded that the infrastructure development is
    going through. The seventh question that was asked is regarding the trust the
    company has towards BCT. Company A, B, and C responded that they trust in sharing
    the data in the BCT platform, but company D answered that they do not trust sharing
    the data in the BCT platform.

    SC area after adopting BCT. Company A, B, and C responded that BCT adoption would
    bring process efficiency, but company D answered that they do not believe that
    BCT adoption will bring process efficiency. The ninth question that was asked
    is regarding transparency in the SC system after the adoption of BCT. Company
    A, B, and C responded that they believe that BCT adoption will be transparent
    in the system, but company D answered that they do not think there will be transparency.
    The last question was regarding the traceability of the product in SC through
    BCT. Company A, B, and C responded that they believe that BCT adoption will help
    better trace the product. Still, company D answered that they do not think BCT
    adoption will help trace the product better.

- en: This study will bring about the perspective of the manufacturing firms in adopting
    BCT adoption in logistics and SC. BCT technologies can transform manufacturing
    SC by eliminating the middleman, streamlining processes, improving overall security,
    and simplifying data management. In the SC, BCT can enhance the transparency and
    accuracy of end-to-end tracking. Actual resources can be digitized, and a decentralized,
    changeless record of all exchanges made, permitting resource following from creation
    to conveyance or end-client use. This expanded SC straightforwardness gives more
    prominent perceivability to organizations and buyers. By expanding SC straightforwardness,
    BCT can assist with lessening misrepresentation in high-esteem products like jewels
    and drug drugs (Ivanov et al., 2019; Vafadarnikjoo et al., 2021; Zhang et al.,
    2018). BCT could assist organizations with seeing how fixings and completed merchandise
    are gone through every subcontractor, decreasing benefit misfortunes from fake
    and dark market exchanging and expanding end-client certainty by lessening or
    disposing of the effect of fake items (Vafadarnikjoo et al., 2021).

    interview was conducted using questions to the three employees of each firm. The
    first firm that was selected deals with consumer electronics products. The second
    firm that was chosen deals with auto components products and supply them to the
    OEM companies. The third company that was selected for the study deals with paint
    manufacturing. The fourth company that was chosen deals with consumer electronics.
    Three respondents were selected from each firm for the interview process. After
    the collection of the data, we had performed a within-case analysis and cross-case
    analysis. It was found that the companies know of BCT technologies and their benefits.

- en: This study shows the adoption of BCT in manufacturing firms in India. Qualitative
    research is conducted using case study methods. Four manufacturing firms were
    selected for the study. Three-person were interviewed for this in each firm. The
    interviewed persons have prior knowledge and experience in the area of BCT. The
    outcome of this study will show how much the manufacturing industries are adopting
    BCT in the systems. It will also motivate them to adopt the technology in the
    near future. The company needs to know the benefits of the technologies and how
    it is revolutionizing the world.
