    out of the Jordanian desert, lies the UN High Commission for Refugees’ Azraq camp.
    Teeming with 32,000 desperate Syrians living in pre-fabricated shelters—rows and
    rows of white, corrugated steel cabins arranged in a military-like grid—Azraq
    poses the logistical challenges of a small city. Yet UNHCR and the other aid agencies
    that give the refugees food, shelter, and a modicum of hope can’t count on the
    kinds of institutions and infrastructure that normal cities use to ensure order,
    security, and functionality for their residents.

    “social capital,” the networks of long-established relationships and bonds of
    trust that allow communities to function, to engage in social interaction and
    exchange. But Azraq can seem especially devoid of it. There are police in Azraq,
    but they are Jordanian. They are not of the people, not of the community. And
    while the crime rates in Azraq are lower than those in nearby Zaatari camp, where
    130,000 Syrians live in conditions that a UN review once described as “lawless,”
    this hot, dry, stony place is hardly welcoming. When Azraq was set up in 2014
    as an alternative to Zaatari’s chaos, refugees complained that it lacked life.
    Electricity was sparse, which meant they couldn’t charge their cellphones, cutting
    them off from family and friends. The lack of a functioning, trustful community
    also heightened the refugees’ fears of being abducted by the extremist organization
    Islamic State. Many initially refused to move to Azraq camp, and although the
    numbers have increased more recently, Azraq is still far below the 130,000 capacity
    for which it was built.

    the digital currency bitcoin and promises a more reliable, immediate way to trace
    transactions. The World Food Program (WFP), a UN agency that feeds 80 million
    people worldwide, is putting 10,000 Azraq refugees through a pilot that uses this

    June 2015, with mounting food shortages and reports of girls being kidnapped by
    militias in nearby villages, Najah and her husband made the drastic decision to
    leave her hometown of Hasaka, where their families had lived for generations.

    an interview conducted on our behalf by WFP staffers working in the Azraq camp.

    something extremely powerful that the rest of us take for granted: a societal
    system of trust, identity, and record-keeping that ties our past to our present,
    anchors us as human beings, and lets us participate in society. The amalgamation
    of information that goes into proving that we can be trusted as a member of society
    has historically depended upon institutions that record and affirm our life events
    and credentials—bank accounts, birth certificates, changes of address, educational
    records, driver’s licenses, etc.—and keep track of our financial transactions.
    To lose all of that, as refugees often do when thrust into “statelessness,” is
    to be put in a highly vulnerable position, one that’s inherently easy for the
    worst of the world’s criminals and terrorist organizations to exploit. If you
    are unable to prove who you are, you are at the mercy of strangers. Among all
    the work that agencies such as the UNHCR and the WFP do, this core function—the
    creation of stand-in societal institutions—is just as important as the food they

    ensures that people aren’t double-spending their food entitlements. That’s a pretty
    important requirement in refugee camps, where supplies are limited and where organized
    crime outfits have been known to steal and hoard food for profit. And it means
    that refugees like Najah will always be able to prove that their accounts are
    legitimate. That would end the periodic and disturbing disruption to provisions
    that many have experienced under the cash-voucher system. In that system, any

    the worst if a database of biometric identifiers ever fell into the hands of an
    ethnic cleansing–minded institution like ISIS. People in the blockchain space,

    decentralize control over self-identifying information so that people aren’t vulnerable

    In early 2017, a group of blockchain enthusiasts at the UN’s New York headquarters
    launched a Web site calling on other UN employees to work with them. The group
    rapidly grew to eighty-five UN staffers worldwide, and they are now working on
    multiple pilots addressing blockchain for development, in partnership with governments
    such as Norway’s. At the World Bank, a new blockchain lab was created with fresh
    funding in June 2017 to explore how the technology could tackle poverty alleviation
    through incorruptible property registries and secure digital identities. The Inter-American
    Development, in concert with MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, is looking
    at how poor Latin American farmers might be able to obtain credit on the basis
    of reliable, blockchain-proven records from commodity warehouses. Non-profit international

    It’s the prospect that this decentralized computing system could resolve the issue
    of social capital deficits that we discussed in the context of the Azraq refugee
    camp. By creating a common record of a community’s transactions and activities
    that no single person or intermediating institution has the power to change, the
    UN’s blockchain provides a foundation for people to trust that they can securely
    interact and exchange value with each other. It’s a new, more powerful solution
    to the age-old problem of human mistrust, which means it could help societies
    build social capital. That’s an especially appealing idea for many underdeveloped
    countries as it would enable their economies to function more like those of developed
    countries—low-income homeowners could get mortgages, for example; street vendors
    could get insurance. It could give billions of people their first opening into

    that these fee-charging institutions, which act as gatekeepers, dictating who
    can and cannot engage in commercial interactions, add cost and friction to our
    economic activities. They also have a habit of failing us—we can think of the
    crisis of 2008 as a case of banks breaching their duty to maintain honest records—or
    of exploiting their toll-collecting power to price gouge and demand exorbitant
    rents. What’s more, there are plenty of situations in which it’s simply not economically
    viable for these costly, inefficient institutions to resolve whatever particular

    monopoly power. These included social media giants like Facebook and Twitter and
    e-marketplace success stories of the “sharing economy” such as Uber and Airbnb.

    toward a shared consensus on what new data to add to the ledger, incorporating
    all manner of economic exchanges, claims of ownership, and other forms of valuable
    information. Each computer updates its own version of the ledger independently
    but does so by following the all-important consensus algorithm. Once new ledger
    entries are introduced, special cryptographic protections make it virtually impossible
    to go back and change them. The computers’ owners are either paid in a digital

    I can trust another person’s claims—about their educational credentials, for example,
    or their assets, or their professional reputation—because they’ve been objectively
    verified by a decentralized system, then I can go into direct business with them.
    I can give them a job. I can collaborate on a joint venture. I can share sensitive
    business information with them. All without having to rely on middlemen like lawyers,
    escrow agents, and others who add costs and inefficiencies to our exchanges. These
    kinds of agreements are the stuff of economic growth. They fuel innovation and
    prosperity. Any technology that reduces friction and makes such collaborations
    happen should benefit everybody, in other words.'

    for the world. We’ve seen how the Internet was co-opted by corporations and how
    that centralization has caused problems—from creating big siloes of personal data
    for shady hackers to steal to incentivizing disinformation campaigns that distort
    our democracy. So, it’s crucial that we not let the people with the greatest capacity
    to influence this technology shape it to suit only their narrow interests. As
    with the early days of the Internet, there is much work to be done to make this
    technology sufficiently safe, scalable, and attendant to everyone’s privacy concerns.

    whether we’re talking about frightened refugees in a desolate Jordanian outpost
    or an interbank market in which the world’s biggest financial institutions exchange
    trillions of dollars daily. By definition, getting blockchain technology right
    requires input from all sectors of society. You can treat that as a clarion call
    to take an interest, to get involved.
