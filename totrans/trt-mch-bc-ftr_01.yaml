- en: Sixty miles east of Amman, in a 5.6-square-mile block of dry, stony ground carved
    out of the Jordanian desert, lies the UN High Commission for Refugees’ Azraq camp.
    Teeming with 32,000 desperate Syrians living in pre-fabricated shelters—rows and
    rows of white, corrugated steel cabins arranged in a military-like grid—Azraq
    poses the logistical challenges of a small city. Yet UNHCR and the other aid agencies
    that give the refugees food, shelter, and a modicum of hope can’t count on the
    kinds of institutions and infrastructure that normal cities use to ensure order,
    security, and functionality for their residents.

  zh: 六十英里东部的安曼，在约旦沙漠刻出的一块5.6平方英里的干燥、多石地块上，是联合国难民署阿兹拉克难民营。这里聚集了3.2万名绝望的叙利亚人，居住在预制的住房里——一排排白色的、波纹状的钢板小屋，像军事般排列在一个网格中。阿兹拉克面临着像小城市一样的后勤挑战。然而，联合国难民署和其他援助机构为难民提供食物、住所和一丝希望，却不能依赖于正常城市为居民确保秩序、安全和功能性所使用的机构和基础设施。
- en: All refugee camps are, by definition, short on what political scientists call
    “social capital,” the networks of long-established relationships and bonds of
    trust that allow communities to function, to engage in social interaction and
    exchange. But Azraq can seem especially devoid of it. There are police in Azraq,
    but they are Jordanian. They are not of the people, not of the community. And
    while the crime rates in Azraq are lower than those in nearby Zaatari camp, where
    130,000 Syrians live in conditions that a UN review once described as “lawless,”
    this hot, dry, stony place is hardly welcoming. When Azraq was set up in 2014
    as an alternative to Zaatari’s chaos, refugees complained that it lacked life.
    Electricity was sparse, which meant they couldn’t charge their cellphones, cutting
    them off from family and friends. The lack of a functioning, trustful community
    also heightened the refugees’ fears of being abducted by the extremist organization
    Islamic State. Many initially refused to move to Azraq camp, and although the
    numbers have increased more recently, Azraq is still far below the 130,000 capacity
    for which it was built.

    the digital currency bitcoin and promises a more reliable, immediate way to trace
    transactions. The World Food Program (WFP), a UN agency that feeds 80 million
    people worldwide, is putting 10,000 Azraq refugees through a pilot that uses this
    system to better coordinate food distribution. In doing so, the WFP is tackling

    June 2015, with mounting food shortages and reports of girls being kidnapped by
    militias in nearby villages, Najah and her husband made the drastic decision to
    leave her hometown of Hasaka, where their families had lived for generations.

    and her ties to what was once a more coherent Syrian nation, Najah was also losing
    something extremely powerful that the rest of us take for granted: a societal
    system of trust, identity, and record-keeping that ties our past to our present,
    anchors us as human beings, and lets us participate in society. The amalgamation
    of information that goes into proving that we can be trusted as a member of society
    has historically depended upon institutions that record and affirm our life events
    and credentials—bank accounts, birth certificates, changes of address, educational
    records, driver’s licenses, etc.—and keep track of our financial transactions.
    To lose all of that, as refugees often do when thrust into “statelessness,” is
    to be put in a highly vulnerable position, one that’s inherently easy for the
    worst of the world’s criminals and terrorist organizations to exploit. If you
    are unable to prove who you are, you are at the mercy of strangers. Among all
    the work that agencies such as the UNHCR and the WFP do, this core function—the
    creation of stand-in societal institutions—is just as important as the food they
    provide. In dusty tent cities filled with dislocated people around the world,
    these humanitarian agencies must undertake the challenging task of recreating
    systems of social trust. They are reconstructing societies, building them all

    In early 2017, a group of blockchain enthusiasts at the UN’s New York headquarters

    rapidly grew to eighty-five UN staffers worldwide, and they are now working on
    multiple pilots addressing blockchain for development, in partnership with governments
    such as Norway’s. At the World Bank, a new blockchain lab was created with fresh
    funding in June 2017 to explore how the technology could tackle poverty alleviation
    through incorruptible property registries and secure digital identities. The Inter-American
    Development, in concert with MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative, is looking
    at how poor Latin American farmers might be able to obtain credit on the basis

- en: Blockchain technology could help achieve what some commentators are calling
    the promise of “Internet 3.0,” a re-architecting of the Net to assert the core
    objective of decentralization that inspired many of the early online pioneers
    who built the Internet 1.0\. It turned out that simply giving networks of computers
    a way to share data directly wasn’t enough to prevent large corporate entities
    from taking control of the information economy. Silicon Valley’s anti-establishment
    coders hadn’t reckoned with the challenge of trust and how society traditionally
    turns to centralized institutions to deal with that. That failure was clear in
    the subsequent Internet 2.0 phase, which unlocked the power of social networks
    but also allowed first-mover companies to turn network effects into entrenched
    monopoly power. These included social media giants like Facebook and Twitter and
    e-marketplace success stories of the “sharing economy” such as Uber and Airbnb.
    Blockchain technologies, as well as other ideas contained in this Internet 3.0
    phase, aim to do away with these intermediaries altogether, letting people forge
    their own bonds of trust to build social networks and business arrangements on
    their own terms.

    designed to incentivize people to provide hard-drive space for a new decentralized
    Web. While it’s quite possible that many ICOs will fall afoul of securities regulations

- en: 'In essence, the blockchain is a digital ledger that’s shared across a decentralized
    network of independent computers, which update and maintain it in a way that allows
    anyone to prove the record is complete and uncorrupted. The blockchain achieves
    this with a special algorithm embedded into a common piece of software run by
    all the computers in the network. The algorithm consistently steers the computers
    toward a shared consensus on what new data to add to the ledger, incorporating
    all manner of economic exchanges, claims of ownership, and other forms of valuable
    information. Each computer updates its own version of the ledger independently
    but does so by following the all-important consensus algorithm. Once new ledger
    entries are introduced, special cryptographic protections make it virtually impossible
    to go back and change them. The computers’ owners are either paid in a digital
    currency, which incentivizes them to work on protecting the system’s integrity,
    or they do their work as part of a commitment to a consortium agreement. The result
    is something unique: a group of otherwise independent actors, each acting in pure
    self-interest, coming together to produce something for the good of all—an immutable
    record that everyone can trust and that’s not managed by a single, centralized
