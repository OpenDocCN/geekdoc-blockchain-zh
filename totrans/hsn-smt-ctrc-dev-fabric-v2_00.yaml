    of fintech by offering transparent and fast transaction processing, higher financial
    data availability, better security, and tremendous cost savings in the financial
    industry. By introducing decentralized authority that makes third-party and middle
    actors obsolete, blockchain has initiated a paradigm shift in the way traditional
    financial institutions and other industries run their business operations.

    one blockchain pilot project in progress. Gartner also predicts that 30% of global
    blockchain projects will make their way to the production stage. Likewise, the
    global blockchain market is growing, manifested by a large number of Forbes Global
    2000 companies currently experimenting with digital trust implementations.

    replacement within 18 months from 2021 in order to stay competitive and secure,
    and to deter obsolescence. Gartner also predicts that by 2025, the business value
    generated by blockchain will move up gradually to $176 billion and then surge
    to surpass the $3.1 trillion mark by 2030.'

    several private and public distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) for building
    blockchain applications. Among the existing DLTs, Hyperledger is a leading platform
    for building enterprise permissioned blockchain applications. By design, Hyperledger
    has embedded features, functionalities, tools, and libraries for building, scaling,
    and managing enterprise blockchain applications.

    we advise companies of all sizes on leveraging blockchain technology and fintech
    to either overcome business challenges or help bring about foreseeable values
    through brand-new visions. We also are partnering with pioneering companies in
    industries like fintech, healthcare, music, and energy to build software-as-a-service
    (SaaS) products using blockchain technology. Our team is composed of industry-leading
    practitioners who have applied the blockchain framework to achieve desired benefits

    industries currently leading blockchain use cases are real estate, healthcare,
    government, higher education, logistics, aviation, finance, and energy. Among
    these industries, finance has been more receptive to adopting a variety of blockchain
    use cases. For example, based on a report by the Bank for International Settlements
    (BIS), 80% of global central banks are researching the advantages and disadvantages

    banks, many financial institutions and independent entrepreneurs are exploring
    the idea of digital-only banks. In doing so, they want to utilize blockchain technology
    to offer banking products such as digital currency, digital wallets, peer-to-peer
    payments, loan and credit, utility tokens, and security tokens. Likewise, we have
    experienced growing demands from banks for implementing Know Your Customer and
    Anti-Money Laundering guidelines for their digital banks, where we typically use
    Hyperledger DLTs like Fabric, Aries, or Indy to manage their customers’ identities.

    you can take advantage of several DLTs, tools, and libraries. For example, Hyperledger
    Grid DLT is well suited for building and managing enterprise supply chain applications,
    as we cover in our final chapter. Although some Hyperledger tools and libraries
    are still at the incubation stage (as we will discuss in [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#overview_of_hyperledger_projects_and_to)),
    once all Hyperledger family members become active, they will collectively provide
    developers and system administration with a complete set of tools to build and
    manage enterprise consortium blockchain applications. Because of high industry
    adoption, Hyperledger Fabric is the leading DLT within the Hyperledger ecosystem.
    As such, we cover Hyperledger Fabric components that are essential for all enterprise
    blockchain applications.

- en: Speaking from our personal experiences, we have seen time and again that successful
    production of an enterprise blockchain application depends on several factors,
    including scalable architecture, choice of cloud provider, performance monitoring,
    integration with existing systems, security audits, smart contract life-cycle
    management, off-chain data management, and documentation. Knowledge of chaincode
    or Fabric components by itself is not sufficient to successfully deploy and scale
    a blockchain application. For example, as we discuss in [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#deploying_hyperledger_fabric_on_the_clo),
    choosing the right cloud provider requires several considerations, as each provider
    offers numerous features and services for building an enterprise blockchain in
    its platform as well as various ways to integrate and upgrade your application
    with other services offered by the same provider.
