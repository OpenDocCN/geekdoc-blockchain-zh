- en: Cryptocurrencies are an electronic medium of exchange that can be traded by
    different trading groups via digital currency exchanges. A growing list of altcoins
    has seen a proliferation of cryptocurrency exchanges emerge over the last decade
    as regulations in many countries around the world struggle to comprehend with
    appropriate investor protection rules. Although there is no central authority
    to register these exchanges, it is estimated that there are currently up to five
    hundred exchanges in circulation, characterised by varying platforms, geographical
    reach, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. Cryptocurrency markets share
    many similar characteristics with both foreign exchange and equity markets such
    as limit order books and matching algorithms, and exchanges that can be both centralised
    or decentralised. As these markets are still in their infancy, what shape or form
    they will take in future will depend on a combination of acceptance from consumers,
    the investment community, as well as worldwide regulators.

    This allows all users to determine the balance of all wallets in existence. However,
    blockchains are only useful for transferring units of cryptocurrency between users.
    When a user wants to exchange his/her cryptocurrency for an asset – say a Pizza,
    the movement of the bitcoin from the consumer to the pizzeria will be visible,
    however the delivery of the pizza will not be recorded. Similarly, in the sale
    of bitcoin for cash, the bitcoin transfer will be recorded but there will be no
    record of the fiat-currency price paid, nor the actual delivery of the fiat currency.

    with the now infamous (and defunct) “Mt Gox”. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies
    necessitated that exchanges take on the role of ‘custodian’. In order to sell
    bitcoin on an exchange, one needs to deposit bitcoins to an address whose private
    key is controlled by the exchange. This address is usually called a ‘hot wallet’,
    and is directly connected to the Internet. It is analogous to the amount of cash
    held by a teller at the bank: the balance is not infinite but is useful for daily
    deposits and withdrawals. Once the balance in the *hot wallet* becomes too large,
    most exchanges move their cryptocurrency supplies into a ‘cold wallet’ – this
    is typically an account held offline which requires multiple individuals to access
    (multisig) – analogous to a bank vault which requires three different keys to
    unlock.'

- en: The market structure of cryptocurrencies resembles modern equity markets with
    continuous trading via a limit order book without intermediaries. Traders can
    either execute immediately with a market order or wait for a better execution
    price with a limit order. Limit orders are stored in the limit order book and
    are executed according to price-time priority. Order driven markets without a
    designated market maker primarily rely on Endogenous Liquidity Providers (ELPs)
    to supply liquidity because it is profitable. Since ELPs have no obligations to
    maintain markets, they can withdraw when liquidity provision becomes risky or
    unprofitable, adversely impacting market quality ([Anand and Venkataraman](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_002),
    [2016](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_002)). To increase the participation of ELPs in
    the market, most cryptocurrency exchanges use the maker-taker model to differentiate
    between orders that provide liquidity and orders that remove liquidity. The maker-taker
    model reduces undesirable trading behaviour by charging a higher fee to traders
    that demand immediacy and lower fees (or no fees) to ELPs for providing liquidity
    to the market. The typical fee for average sized transactions ranges between 10
    and 30 basis points (bps) for traders that consume liquidity and between 0 and
    15 bps for market makers, depending on the cryptocurrency traded. Fees are generally
    calculated on the value (USD equivalent) executed in the last 30 days.

    deposited/withdrawn from the exchange, users who deposit fiat currency, buy bitcoin,
    hold them within the exchange, and then sell them at the same exchange later for
    a profit, will not generate any record on the blockchain. In fact, trades themselves
    within an exchange will not be recorded at all, except by the exchange. Many exchanges
    make this transaction level data public, however this is entirely separate from
    the blockchain itself. Like Bloomberg for equities, organisations such as [cryptocompare.com](http://cryptocompare.com)

    an “I owe you” of bitcoin from Bitfinex to its users. Within 244 days, all hacked
    bitcoins were repaid. Often, exchanges will go bankrupt, leaving their users as

    and acting as a custodian for the assets deposited inside the market. In contrast,

    crypto assets to trade (i. e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin) as well as which currency
    pairs to create markets in (i. e. Euro/Bitcoin, USD/Bitcoin, Ethereum/Bitcoin).
    Users can deposit crypto assets and/or fiat currencies, and trade these assets
    in a centralized limit order book. Whilst these markets are all technically operated
    independently in isolation of one another, arbitrage will tend to keep these markets
    synchronised, similar to the global FOREX markets (see, [Makarov and Schoar](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_013),

    number of initial coin offerings conducted on the Ethereum platform using ERC20
    tokens) allowed limit orders (the fundamental necessity for limit order markets)
    to be coded into self-contained contracts. A smart contract can be encoded such
    that it offers to provide N units of an ERC20 currency in return for E units of
    Ethereum. A user can then send a ‘market’ order, delivering E units of Ethereum
    and automatically receiving N units of ERC20\. Such a contract is entirely analogous
    to a limit order.

    to observe all available orders, rank them by their price priority, and then choose
    which orders to interact with. The first DEXs (i. e. OasisDex and EtherDelta)
    used *fully on-chain* execution. This means that all order entries, executions
    and cancellations were processed by the Ethereum blockchain itself. As such, the
    speed of matching was constrained to the blocktime of Ethereum (currently 14 seconds).

    to enter, amend or cancel an order would significantly constrain the growth of
    DEXs. This led to the creation of *Hybrid Exchanges*, such as IDEX and 0×, where
    a centralized organisation collated all order entries, amendments and cancellations
    off-chain (similar to a centralized exchange) but custody and clearing (after
    matches were confirmed) were undertaken on the Ethereum blockchain. Centralizing
    the limit order book facilitated much faster confirmation of transactions and
    reduced the cost constraint of needing to pay miners to update stale limit orders.
    However, it did introduce a single, central point of failure and/or censorship.

    contracts. Another disadvantage of DEXs is that they do not strictly enforce price
    time priority. This, combined with the complexity and high precision (many decimal
    points) of cryptocurrency trades mean mistakes can be very costly – missing one
    decimal place can result in an arbitrage opportunity with a factor of 10× or more.

    billion USD. But how investable are cryptocurrencies? [Dyhrberg et al.](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_008)
    ([2018](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_008)) examine this issue by estimating the transaction
    costs and intraday trading patterns of the Bitcoin/USD exchange rate across the
    Gdax, Gemini and Kraken cryptocurrency exchanges. In contrast to quote-driven
    markets, where effective spreads are generally smaller than quoted spreads as
    some trades take place within the spread, traders in fully electronic order-driven
    cryptocurrency markets cannot trade inside the quotes. Furthermore, trades frequently
    do not execute at the best prices as quoted depths are very small and order quantity
    frequently exceeds the best posted depth. Consequently, traders are forced to
    walk up the limit order book and effective spreads are frequently larger than
    quoted spreads. [Dyhrberg et al.](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_008) ([2018](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_008))
    find that quoted spread across the three cryptocurrency exchanges ranges from
    0.54 to 7.80 while effective spread ranges from 5.60 to 22.51 bps. This is significantly
    narrower than the average quoted (effective) spread of 37.2 (23.9) bps of stocks

    In fact, Bitcoin spreads are comparable to the one hundred most liquid stocks
    on the NYSE which display an average quoted (effective) spread of 10.9 (7.3) bps
    ([Boehmer et al.](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_004), [2005](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_004)).

    Leveraged funds are defined in Traders in Financial Futures (TFF) as traders that
    may be engaged in managing and conducting proprietary futures trading and trading
    on behalf of speculative clients.[⁸](#fn_29) Other reportables, meanwhile are
    traders that are not placed in a dealer, asset manager, or leveraged fund category
    and mainly consist of retail traders with fewer than 25 bitcoin contracts. The
    relatively high representation of traders with small positions in CFTC reportable
    data distinguishes it from other more prominent financial market contracts and

- en: While the physical trading on cryptocurrency exchanges is comparable to trading
    on other equity exchanges, relative tick size, the minimum allowable trading price
    increment expressed as a percentage of the price is much smaller than on equity
    exchanges. Tick size selection is one of the most important decisions made by
    an exchange to influence overall market quality. Tick size determines the cost
    to gain price priority over a standing limit order and dictates the minimum bid-ask
    spread, a major component of trading cost. As the price of cryptocurrencies rose,
    and Bitcoin in particular, the relative spread became increasingly small and unconstrained.
    On most cryptocurrency exchanges is it either one cent (for example, Bitstamp
    and Coinbase) or ten cents (Bitfinex) which leads to a relative tick size of as
    low as 0.01 bps when one bitcoin trades around 10,000 USD.

- en: With such a small trading increment, it is relatively inexpensive for traders
    to improve limit orders by a negligible amount to gain priority, as illustrated
    in [Figure 6](#b_9783110660807-006_fig_006). This ‘undercutting’ behaviour dis-incentivizes
    traders to supply liquidity and encourages them to cross the spread to get executed,
    leading to lower depth at best quotes and deteriorations in quoted spread.

    wanting to bet against Bitcoin (or other altcoins) or engage in some form of risk
    management were limited to just a few platforms. Amongst the most popular for
    shorting were Bitfinex and Poloniex. In a short sale, the seller enters into a
    regular spot sale of the digital currency except that the transaction is settled
    by delivering cryptocurrency that was borrowed. In this regard shorting cryptocurrencies
    is similar to shorting listed securities – short sellers must locate the currency
    to borrow it. Cryptocurrencies can be borrowed on an exchange (e. g. Bitfinex
    or Poloniex) through peer-to-peer functionality, meaning that borrowers are borrowing
    from other participants, who will receive a rebate in the form of interest income.
    The rebate will depend on the term of the loan and the rate will exhibit variation
    over time. The cryptocurrency borrower may seek offers or make a bid to borrow
    digital tokens and are not permitted to exceed certain leverage thresholds. Bitcoin
    borrowers on Bitfinex, for example, are not permitted to borrow more than 70%
    of the bitcoins sold in a short sale. The fiat proceeds of any short sale serve
    as collateral for the borrowing of the bitcoins until those bitcoins are repaid.

    Bitcoin (and other altcoins), alternative shorting options, for example, CFDs
    (contracts for difference) have been established by a range of brokers including,
    Plus500 and eToro. CFDs function in a manner that is similar to futures contracts,
    in that investors can bet on an underlying asset without having to own it physically,
    thereby allowing for short positions.

    in the peer-to-peer crypto exchange platforms, repo markets have recently been
    canvased with crypto assets. A repo can be thought of as a loan secured against
    collateral, except the collateral is not pledged, it is sold and repurchased at
    maturity. By providing crypto asset holders with an ability to lend in this environment,
    professional market participants could borrow for the purposes of taking or covering
    short positions. A current example of a platform providing this service is Oxygen.[^(12)](#fn_33)

    These markets allow investors to create an event to make a wager based on the
    outcome. For example, predicting that Bitcoin will decline by a certain percentage
    sets a wager that other parties can participate in by taking the other side. These
    wagers are conducted in an unregulated market and thus pose significant risks.

- en: Unlike stock markets, all transactions on the blockchain are public, including
    the wallet address of the user. This may seem harmless at first, however it exposes
    large orders to the risk of being front run. Imagine a trader holds 100 million
    USD of Bitcoin, and decides to sell. In order to do so, the trader first needs
    to transfer the large stack of bitcoins to an exchange. Such a transaction will
    show up on the blockchain, and monitoring sites such as WhaleAlert.io may broadcast
    this transaction to the world at large. This may not be an issue if the trader
    is able to execute large orders immediately. However, due to the trust-less nature
    of cryptocurrencies, exchanges typically ‘lock’ deposits for 30-60 minutes to
    protect themselves from double spend attacks. This means that keen observers,
    noticing a large influx of bitcoins, may infer the depositor intends on selling.
    If this sale is large enough to have a significant price impact, the observer
    may themselves sell the asset deposited in order to ‘front run’ the depositor,
    making profit from the eventual price impact of the large order. Analytics like
    these enabled researchers to identify that there may be a connection between the
    USD Tether and the pumping of the bitcoin price on the associated Bitfinex exchange
    (see [Griffin and Shams](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_012), [2018](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_012)).

    These engines are now calibrated to separate orders to an incredibly fine measurement

    is mispriced, which gives rise to potential arbitrage. In order to exploit this
    opportunity, a user needs to submit a ‘market’ order to the DEX, exhausting the
    attractive liquidity. The issue is that this order will not be confirmed until
    the next Ethereum block is mined. As miners process transactions in order of fee
    priority, an arbitrageur can offer a high fee to interact with a profitable arbitrage
    opportunity. [Daian et al.](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_007) ([2019](#b_9783110660807-006_ref_007))

    with a fee – say $1\. This order is only executed once incorporated by a miner
    into a transaction. Before the market order is executed, a second arbitrageur
    may also spot this opportunity, and offer a $2 fee to the miner. When a miner
    eventually solves the cryptographic puzzle, they will collect fees from both users,
    but only the user with the highest fee will have their order executed. The ‘losing’
    bidder will pay the fee to attempt to interact with a smart contract which has
    already been exhausted of liquidity.
