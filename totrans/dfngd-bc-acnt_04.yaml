- en: Conventional financing mechanisms, such as initial public offerings (IPOs),
    have been under pressure in recent years, as burgeoning internet technologies
    facilitate cumbersome processes and eliminate unnecessary participants. The rise
    of online platforms coincided with private placement growth, helping entrepreneurs
    connect with a large audience of potential investors at the often critical early
    business stages. Now, as blockchain technology reinvents the fabric of the internet,
    the private placement fundraising method is being transformed with Security Token
    Offerings (STOs).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Founded in 2016, Curzio Research is a financial newsletter publisher that provides
    individual investors with access to curated investment research and analysis.
    Within the first 18 months of business, Curzio Research amassed about 40,000 readers.
    A publisher’s success is largely dependent on its ability to convert its reader
    list into paid subscribers. Curzio Research has done well in this area, generating
    $6.4 million within the first two years of launch. For comparison, over the same
    period, their largest competitors booked $2 billion in sales, while distributing
    to millions of readers.

    newsletter industry, list size means everything. After analyzing the data from
    their existing list and getting the proper management team in place, Curzio Research
    was ready for strategic expansion. Since capital serves as the fuel for scaling
    a business, the company set out in 2019 to raise $3–12 million with a private
    offering in mind.'

    the offering has been registered with the SEC or an exemption from registration
    is available. An offering that meets exemption requirements is typically referred

    be offered under the following exemptions:'

    $1M maximum raise limit. The company also wasn’t interested in a Regulation A+
    offering, due to the increased reporting requirements and 60 day waiting period.
    By process of elimination, Regulation D was the logical exemption; when deciding
    between Rule 506(c) or Rule 506(b), general solicitation was the main factor.
    Since sales and marketing are specialties of Curzio Research, a Reg D 506(c) offering
    was chosen.

    the downsides of traditional private offerings. The intermediaries wanted to extract
    exorbitant fees for simply making introductions to potential investors. Moreover,
    brokers sought rent without guaranteeing adequate liquidity for Curzio Research’s
    potential financial instrument. It was apparent that Curzio Research’s traditional
    private placement was going to generate more value for the middlemen than Curzio
    Research’s stakeholders.

    with CEO token holders, as per details defined in the PPM. Such events included,
    but were not limited to, the potential future declaration and payment of the anticipated
    dividend, optional redemption and/or repurchase of the CEO tokens by the company,
    and information rights related to the delivery of unaudited financial statements
    following the close of each fiscal year. Curzio Research also intended to update
    investors on all important business news and transactions. Depending on news flow,
    the company intended to release these updates on a monthly, quarterly or biannual
    basis. Curzio Research will use Securitize’s community management solution to
    streamline ongoing communications with investors.

    liquidity for STOs. Their core function is to ensure fair and orderly trading
    of security tokens and efficiently disseminate price information for the exchange’s
    users. The STEs play a crucial role in preventing non-compliant, unregistered
    resales of restricted securities within the security token ecosystem.

    As such, secondary trading is subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in
    the PPM. Investors are barred from transferring the CEO tokens until Cuzio Research
    designates a STE or alternative trading system for trading. After a secondary
    market is selected, all potential purchasers of the CEO tokens will be required
    to verify their status and complete requisite KYC and AML checks with the exchange
    before they can acquire the tokens. From a technical perspective, CEO token transfers
    are governed by the Compliance Service, a built in component of Securitize’s DS
    Protocol Ecosystem. The DS Protocol Ecosystem is illustrated in [Fig. 8.5](#fig5).

    uploaded so that they check using the Compliance Service if tokens can be exchanged
    between specific wallet addresses. When DS Token contracts send transferTo and
    transferFrom validation calls, the Compliance Service checks the sender and receiver
    address in the Registry Service, where each investor’s profile and related compliance
    information is stored on-chain. After obtaining the investor profiles, the Compliance
    Service validates that both have the correct categories, and are within the existing
    limits given the appropriate regulation. If everything checks out, then the trade
    can occur on the exchange. If the appropriate conditions are not met, the transaction
    will be stopped and the parties will be informed of the reason.

    Protocol architecture. The Trust Service is used by the other components to ensure
    that a given actor or DS App is permitted to take certain actions. It serves as
    a control for the other DS Services, all actors involved in those services have
    previously been authorized to perform the related functions by the Trust Service.
    For example, the Trust Service ultimately authorizes an exchange to introduce
    additional entries into the Registry Service. As per the DS Protocol model, exchanges
    are delegated the responsibility of gathering KYC and accreditation information
    for new investors after the CEO token lock-up expires.

    market (DPP), where there are major inefficiencies and problems in the clearing
    and settlement process. The lack of standardization and compatibility leads to
    a settlement process that averages six to eight weeks. Blockchains can offer a
    variety of solutions for the trading, clearing and settlement of restricted securities.
    Using distributed ledger technology, STEs can bring efficiency, clarity and interoperability
    to the fragmented DPP market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OFN’s framework for transforming DPP market processes contains a uniform protocol
    for standardizing assets and data. The resulting interoperability creates a mechanism
    for tokenized trading to connect off-chain “traditional” alternative assets and
    on-chain “digital” assets like the CEO token. OFN’s white paper eloquently expounds
    the typical securities transaction lifecycle (STL), stating it “starts with a
    trade initiated from an investor, either a buyer or a seller. Their broker sends
    the transaction to an exchange for processing, where it is matched with a corresponding
    counterparty. The exchange then sends this matched transaction to a central counterparty
    clearing house (CCP), where it is reconciled with the brokers to reduce default
    and counterparty risk. From there, the transaction is sent to settlement, where
    the investor’s custodians (who hold the assets and funds) work via the central
    securities depository (CSD) to ensure that assets and funds are transferred from
    one source to another. Finally, the transaction data is sent to the registrar
    or transfer agent of the underlying issuer to update their shareholder list and
    information.”

    “trust” between parties in today’s STL processes. The current model provides standardization
    of assets, interoperability between participants, reduces counterparty risk and
    ensures transaction verification. However, the STL model has significant downsides
    too: massive scale is required for network viability of the centralized trust
    entities, a large entry cost for smaller players to gain network access, and data
    is redundantly stored across multiple intermediaries, among other issues. The
    complexities and inefficiencies from this antiquated legacy system lead to unnecessarily
    high costs for issuers and investors throughout the STL, while the middlemen significantly
    benefit from rent seeking. To counter these inefficiencies, OFN has developed
    a distributed securities depository system, replacing the need for CCPs and CSDs
    in a reimagined STL.'

    alternative assets, as well as the reporting, compliance, clearing and settlement
    processes related to those assets. By replacing the CCPs and CSDs with the OFN,
    market participants no longer need to rely on manually reconciled ledgers; real-time
    verifications of asset ownership and fund availability are finally possible, effectively
    eliminating counterparty risk in the process. Investors trading in the secondary
    market using OFN directly benefit from lower fees, made possible by the efficiencies
    and cost savings from a standardized and streamlined process for compliance, transfer
    of ownership, escrow and distribution of proceeds.

    mechanism bridges the gap between certificate and book-entry records with a new
    form of distributed ledger book-entry, making instant settlement achievable. Digital
    asset market enthusiasts believe these benefits will eventually cause a full migration
    from traditional off-chain electronic book-entry systems, to a recording of ownership
    entirely on the distributed ledger.

- en: The mining and mineral sector, a sector that is notoriously slow to adopt new
    technology, is moving rapidly to incorporate blockchain technology. As discussed
    in the next chapter, blockchain applications are being developed for recordkeeping
    and sourcing in the mineral industry. Here, we briefly discuss an innovative way
    that the mining industry is obtaining financing for its projects by leveraging
    blockchain and smart contract technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mining is a capital intensive industry, requiring significant up-front investment
    and it is fraught with economic uncertainty. Economic volatility on raw material
    prices in the commodity market has been prevalent since the 2008 global financial
    crisis. The mining boom, pre-financial crisis, was fueled by rapid growth and
    industrialization in developing countries. However, since the financial crisis
    there has been a steep decline in both end demand and up-front credit availability.
    While many other sectors have recovered over the past decade, the economic recovery
    has not been as pronounced in the mining industry. A lower than expected growth
    rate in China, continuing debt problems in Europe, and tightening of credit worldwide
    have all impeded the recovery. The decline in commodity prices leading to falling
    returns and income has created a mismatch between miners’ long-term investment
    horizon and investors’ short-term return horizon. Consequently, miners have recently
    encountered a challenging environment to raise equity capital to fund ventures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Against the backdrop of falling profits, tightening credit and greater investor
    demands, the mining industry is looking for creative financing options to fund
    their growth projects. They are combining traditional financing options with alternative
    financing sources.^([²](#fn2)) Mining royalty and metal streaming financing have
    been particularly popular with miners as a financing source allowing access to
    early-stage capital without diluting equity ownership. A mining royalty is a right
    to receive payment based on a percentage of mineral production or of the revenues
    or profits generated from the sale of those minerals. The royalty-financing typically
    involves an up-front payment to the mining company from the investor, in return
    for a contractual undertaking by the mining company to pay a specified percentage
    of future revenue for a specified period.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The structure of royalty-financing is well-suited to implementation through
    smart contracts and consensus mechanisms. Hence, mining companies are combining
    the royalty-financing model with the digital wrapper and offering security tokens
    to investors. Moreover, the stream financing model – a metals prepayment structure
    – is amenable to tokenization. Thereby, the application of the leading-edge technology
    to an age-old problem generates an innovative solution that is beneficial to both
    parties, the investors and the mining company.

- en: 'Businesses in need of capital are seeking out new financing options. For private
    offerings there are two options: a traditional private placement or STO. After
    performing a cost–benefit analysis, some businesses are deciding that a STO provided
    the most value to its stakeholders.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    administrative procedures, condensed process timelines, as well as an expanded
    base of potential investors who were given the option to contribute both fiat
    and digital currencies over the internet. The streamlined process can be completed
    within several months, with the preparation of documents and legal reviews requiring
    the most time. In the case of Curzio Research, they were able to raise their target
    of $3 million within the first two weeks of the offering and a total of $4.1 million
    from over a hundred investors. The traditional mining industry has also employed
    this new vehicle to raise capital to fund new ventures.

- en: A STO not only provides a cheap and quick way to raise funds, it also provides
    logistical advantages over the life of the tokens. In the case of Curzio Research,
    by operating within Securitize’s DS Protocol Ecosystem, the CEO tokens are expected
    to reduce compliance and operating expenses typically associated with a financial
    instrument’s lifecycle events. The tokens also provide utility, as users can access
    Curzio Research’s web-based content via its online platform. After the lock-up
    period, CEO token investors should realize enhanced liquidity from the designated
    STEs. Investors can also utilize Securitize’s platform to manage token-related
    events in one place, as these developments are recorded on distributed ledgers
    throughout the digital securities ecosystem.
