- en: The agri-food sector is the highest application of blockchain technology to
    track and trace components and raw material along the supply chain. Blockchain
    presents many potential advantages; however, small and medium enterprises often
    lack the means and knowledge to exploit this technology fully. This chapter presents
    a case study of blockchain application, namely Trusty, a platform for the notarization
    of fully traceable information on blockchain in the agri-food sector. Thanks to
    its limited up-front implementation costs and its modularity, it seems particularly
    suitable for use by SMEs. The authors' goal is to identify some useful issues
    for practitioners and inspiration for future research for academics. The most
    relevant topics that will be placed are (1) needs and expectations of SMEs in
    the agri-food sector towards the blockchain, (2) difficulties of introducing blockchain
    into SMEs, (3) the agnostic approach to blockchain, (4) the different value of
    notarized information for B2B and B2C companies, and (5) limits of some blockchains
    compared to others.

- en: 'The agri-food sector, valued at around $8 trillion per year, faces significant
    changes due to the shift in people''s consumption habits towards healthier and
    environmentally friendly products. Consequently, companies are dramatically changing
    their value proposition and product offering to suit these expectations better.
    In this context, blockchain technology allows companies not only to create a relationship
    of trust with consumers but also to create a platform to communicate with them
    directly (De Giovanni, 2020). Traditionally, the investments and the efforts to
    drive such a change are significant and often barely affordable by SMEs, which
    may remain for the most part excluded: they often lack the resources or skills
    to implement such technologies. This is the niche that Trusty has entered, and
    this chapter analyzes the Trusty case study. Trusty is a Software as a Service
    platform blockchain-based. It aims to improve customer engagement, improve information
    disclosure, build a positive brand reputation, reduce waste, and optimize the
    supply chain. Trusty, created by Apio, aims to promote the application and deployment
    of blockchain in the Agri-food industry, starting from the smaller players (e.g.
    SMEs). Thanks to a Freemium business model (consisting of three packages: Free,
    Basic, and Premium), Trusty allows SMEs to adopt blockchains with a modular approach,
    limiting initial investments and overcoming many of the limits of more demanding
    solutions as IBM Food Trust. With Trusty, the initial implementation costs can
    be pretty limited at the beginning because investments can be scaled up easily
    overtime when the blockchain starts bringing tangible results. The onboarding
    process on Trusty involves typically four steps: analysis, data entry, implementation,
    and roll-out. In this chapter, to present a practical application of Trusty, the
    authors deal with the case of Trusty applied to Pastificio Mancini. Pastificio
    Mancini is an Italian company that produces high-quality pasta, taking care of
    the value chain from the cultivation of raw materials to the final product. Pastificio
    Mancini has chosen to use Trusty to communicate to its customers the quality and
    the value of its production, developed with full respect to the environment. Pastificio
    Mancini was one of the first companies to apply the Trusty Premium package. With
    this package, various automations were developed, such as the automatic insertion
    of data on the blockchain and the automated printing of QR-Codes on pasta packages.
    Some exciting issues emerge from the case, such as (i) specific needs of SMEs,
    (ii) the agnostic approach to the blockchain used by Trusty, (iii) different information
    needs of B2B customers compared to B2C customers. There are also some challenges
    or weaknesses of this application. The authors identify at least three: (i) limits
    of some blockchains such as Bitcoin compared to other blockchains, (ii) difficulties
    in the introduction of blockchain in SMEs, (iii) particularities of the Pastificio
    Mancini case that make it an “easy” case. Through the presentation of this case,
    the authors intend to present a successful case of blockchain application to an
    often-neglected category of companies that is useful both for practitioners and
    for giving interesting research ideas to academics.'

- en: Agri-food is one of the most important sectors from an economic, social, and
    environmental perspective. The food industry is worth about $8 trillion a year
    and accounts for 10% of total consumer spending by employing 40% of the world's
    workforce (Esther Rodriguez, 2018). It is an industry that presents numerous challenges
    and opportunities throughout the value chain (Goedde et al., 2015). Among the
    most relevant trends, we can identify the growth of the world population that
    will lead the caloric needs to grow by 70% by 2050 (Eliaz and Jagt, 2020a), food
    waste that amounts to 1.6 trillion tons per year (Hegnsholt et al., 2018), climate
    change and environmental sustainability (Riedmatten et al., 2013), the polarization
    of the sector towards larger or smaller organizations (Goedde et al., 2015). To
    face these challenges, it becomes essential for the companies to adapt the entire
    value chain. The value chain in the agri-food sector includes the network of parties
    involved in the production, processing, and sale of food from the farm to the
    consumer's table (Riedmatten et al., 2013). It includes producers, processors,
    distributors, final consumers, and governments (Santhanam et al., 2018). Each
    actor is responsible for its part of the value chain (De Giovanni, 2021). However,
    given the high level of interdependence between the parties, only through the
    collaboration of all the stakeholders in the chain is it possible to face the
    challenges that characterize it (Riedmatten et al., 2013).

- en: Consumer's attention to these issues is increasing, and they are changing their
    consumption habits to favour the approach they believe the most. This phenomenon
    is because of the growing level of education, urbanization, health consciousness,
    and the availability of new technologies to consumers (Pinder et al., 2017). Among
    the main concerns for consumers, on the one hand, we find the attention to health,
    food quality, and food safety (Figure 1) (Rogers and Pieters, 2020), on the other
    hand, the desire for responsible and sustainable food consumption (Dongoski and
    Ramsey, 2020). Starting from the first point, today, more than ever, consumers
    are food and health-conscious and want to know how and where their food is grown
    (Dongoski and Ramsey, 2020). As a result, the demand for healthy, organic, and
    GMO-free food is constantly increasing (Eliaz and Jagt, 2020b). As a result, the
    global-health-and-wellness beverage and packaged food market represents a growth
    rate of over 3% per year and expects to reach $851 billion by 2022 (Santhanam
    et al., 2018). Shifting the focus to environmental sustainability, an Accenture
    survey shows that more than 55% of consumers are willing to pay more for environmentally
    friendly products (Pinder et al., 2017). While if we consider millennials alone,
    73% are willing to spend more on sustainable products (Eliaz and Jagt, 2020b).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, products marked as sustainable grow 5.6 times faster than products
    that are not (Eliaz and Jagt, 2020a). Therefore, healthy and environmentally sustainable
    food is increasingly seen as a premium product. As a result, companies need to
    demonstrate to their customers that their products meet specific standards. This
    has caused the growth of special tools and labels to communicate the product's
    characteristics to the consumer (Santhanam et al., 2018). The special labels that
    are growing the most are “Organic” and “non-GMO” (Deines and Linhardt, 2020).

- en: The new habits of consumers and their willingness to pay more for products with
    the characteristics just seen have led to an increase in fraud involving counterfeit
    food products (De Giovanni, 2019). The 2019 European Union report shows how the
    number of European Union intervention requests for fraud involving food has doubled
    from 2016 to 2019 (Publication office of the European Union, 2020). In particular,
    47% of the requests concern cases of mislabeling, 20% Replacement / Dilution /
    Addition / Removal in product, 16% Unapproved treatment and / or process, 15%
    Absent / Falsified / manipulated documentation (Figure 2) (Publication office
    of the European Union, 2020). Therefore, consumers are often not getting what
    they are paying for (Kruh, 2019). Among the most counterfeit products there are
    fats and oils, fish and related products, meat and related products (Figure 3)
    (Publication office of the European Union, 2020). In addition to the economic
    damage to the sector, estimated by KPMG at more than $ 100 Billion (Kruh, 2019),
    the danger to consumers' health is concrete. On average, over 300 food recalls
    are reported in the U.S. each year, which translates into over 75 million foodborne
    illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths (Riedmatten et al., 2013).
    If we look at the origin of counterfeit products, Spain and Italy are among the
    first in terms of the number of cases (Publication office of the European Union,
    2020). Therefore, traceability and transparency become fundamental for companies
    to convey to the consumer the efforts made to face these challenges and to meet
    their needs (Eliaz and Jagt, 2020b). It also becomes crucial for the consumer
    to understand which value chain companies have aligned with their new habits and
    demands (Pinder et al., 2017). Technology is a fundamental tool to limit or solve
    these problems.

- en: 'In the agri-food sector, the technology already has extensive application throughout
    the value chain (Walker et al., 2020). Among the most widespread technologies,
    we can find: big-data and advanced analytics, robotics, aerial imagery, sensors,
    sophisticated local weather forecasts, genetic engineering, biohacking, cloud
    technology (Esther Rodriguez, 2018; Magnin, 2016; Pinder et al., 2017; Sylvester,
    2019). The applications of these technologies have led, among others: to precision
    agriculture, specific financial systems for agriculture, the production of genetically
    modified organisms, the production in the laboratory of proteins for food use
    (Esther Rodriguez, 2018; Magnin, 2016; Walker et al., 2020). However, the technology
    most interested in addressing the issues we discussed in the previous paragraphs
    is technologies for food traceability. These technologies make it possible to
    create visibility and traceability throughout the value chain, guaranteeing a
    sustainable supply, increasing income for farmers, a reduction in food fraud,
    a reduction in waste (Bakker et al., 2020). The most promising and effective technology
    for food traceability is blockchain. The blockchain increases transparency by
    creating an immutable record of the life of products from the farm to the consumer
    (Sylvester, 2019). There are different approaches in applying the blockchain depending
    on the type of blockchain chosen, the tracking technology, the method of entering
    data into the blockchain, the way of managing and storing data, the practice of
    communicating data to consumers (Köhler and Pizzol, 2020). If we look at the type
    of blockchain used, the primary choice is between public, private, or hybrid blockchains.
    Some examples of the use of public blockchains in the industry are Provenance,
    OpenSC. TE-Food uses a hybrid approach, while FairChain and IBM Food Trust use
    private blockchain (Köhler and Pizzol, 2020).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To track the products along the value chain, different technologies are applied
    to support the blockchain, such as RFID tags, QR codes, NFC tags (Ge et al., 2017).
    For example, BeefLedger has combined different technologies in addition to blockchains
    such as Internet of Things (IoT), analytics, smart contracts, and digital tokens
    to trace the origin, simplifying payments and limiting the risk of fraud in the
    quality and sustainability of the livestock farming in Australia (Leong et al.,
    2018). The insertion of data in the blockchain represents one of the most critical
    steps of the tracing process since it is the easiest to tamper. Therefore, different
    strategies are applied in this phase, such as GPS sensors, IoT sensors, or so-called
    oracles (Sylvester, 2019). Oracles are trusted intermediaries that connect the
    real world to the blockchain to acquire information (Sylvester, 2019). Once collected,
    the data must be managed and stored.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some cases, there is the insertion of data directly on the blockchain, in
    others, they use external databases, and they record on the blockchain only the
    hash (Leong et al., 2018). Finally, the data can be communicated to consumers
    in different ways. In most cases, a QR code or an NFC sensor is used (Köhler and
    Pizzol, 2020). In the next paragraph, we will see the approach used by Apio and
    its solution for the application of blockchain to the food supply chain called
    Trusty. Then, we will see what strategies are adopted and the reasons that led
    to these choices.

    Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPICS) is a world standard developed
    by GS1 that allows creating and sharing data on visibility events within the same
    company and between different companies. Thanks to EPCIS, it is possible to identify
    origin/production location based on the Global Location Number (GLN). The codes
    can trace the plant or farm where production occurs, identify the products, the
    packaging, and pallets through the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). In August
    2020, Var Group, one of the leading Italian System Integrators, made a capital
    increase in Apio to facilitate the scale-up of innovative solutions through access
    to financial capital and a multi-certified companies' ecosystem. Var Group is

- en: Given the importance of the blockchain-related business for Apio and the specific
    skills required for its development, Apio has developed a business line dedicated
    to Trusty. Trusty is a Software as a Service platform to improve customer engagement,
    positively impact brand equity, reduce waste, and optimize the supply chain. One
    of the peculiarities of Trusty is that it was explicitly developed to be easily
    implemented by small and medium enterprises SME, a category until initially mostly
    excluded from the adoption of the blockchain. Trusty can be used by any player
    alongside the supply chain to authenticate information such as purchase order,
    dispatch advice, receiving advice quantities, and products related to it. In particular,
    the platform helps the food producers improve customer's experience through a
    full disclosure about the provenance and ingredients of products, journeying through
    the entire supply chain with a simple scan of a QR code. Trusty uses Blockchain
    technology to verify and secure all the information about a product. The traceability
    events shared with the customers are retrieved from IBM Food Trust or other Blockchain
    platforms following an agnostic approach to blockchain. Unlike most other traceability
    platforms, Trusty enables food producers to upload descriptions, pictures, and
    videos of company facilities and products. The information is shared with the
    final consumer thanks to a QR-Code that can be printed in the product's packaging
    or other places to which it is easy for the consumer to have access. The consumer
    only has to scan the QR code with his smartphone, and he will have access to the
    web page with all the information of that specific product. He can look at the
    company description and information, the product description and features such
    as its allergens, the product and company certifications, the traceability events
    on the blockchain. The level of detail of the information available depends on
    which package of services the manufacturing company has decided to use.

- en: 'Trusty is based on a Freemium business model. The customer can choose between
    three different packages for functionality and costs: free, basic, and premium
    (Table 1). The free version provides basic features, and it is the best option
    for SMEs that want to approach blockchain technology. With the free version, it
    is possible to generate unlimited information on lots and QR-Codes, notarize information
    on the Bitcoin blockchain, and have basic statistics on user interactions and
    QR-Codes. For example, how often has someone scanned the QR Code, from which place
    it was scanned, and the average age of those who search or buy products. Of course,
    the free version also has limitations. In the free version, the company should
    put the information on the blockchain manually, and it has limited access to statistics
    about customer activities within the web page that contains the information on
    their products. In addition to free services, the Basic package allows you to
    enter data on Trusty in an automated way and export the data recorded on the blockchain
    on platforms external to Trusty, such as e-commerce or a company website. The
    price for the Basic package is €250 per month. The €250 includes 1000 lots to
    be registered. If a company needs to register more lots, it can purchase them
    separately. The integration between the company''s IT systems and Trusty for automated
    data entry can be done independently by the customer''s staff or by Apio for an
    additional price, generally between €3000 and €10000\. The Premium package includes
    all the customized projects requested by companies with specific needs and carried
    out by Apio through the development team. In the Premium package, it is possible
    to include almost any type of customization such as the complete customization
    of web pages, the integration of Trusty with IoT or Industry 4.0 sensors for the
    automated recording of data on the blockchain, the use of other blockchains different

    implementation, and roll-out. The level of detail and the effort of Apio and the
    client required for each phase depend on the package that will be chosen. In this
    section, we will look at the case of a complete Premium package. A series of aspects
    are investigated in the analysis phase. First of all, it is necessary to understand
    the company''s expectations regarding the project it wants to develop with Trusty.
    Typically there are three main objectives: increasing transparency towards consumers,
    increasing the operational efficiency of the supply chain, accessing new sales
    channels. Then, they need to define the products for which you want to start the
    traceability project. They could be all the products or just some to make a first
    test of the solution. For each product, the phases we intend to trace on the blockchain
    and which supporting data we need are identified. Based on this, it is then necessary
    to identify where the products are grown or processed and any third-party suppliers.
    The last steps of the analysis phase foresee the definition with the customer
    of the data entry interfaces on Trusty and the interfaces to visualise the data
    by the consumer. The analysis phase allows you to produce a project document that
    evaluates all activities. For each activity, timescales and a budget will be defined
    for their implementation. In the data entry and implementation phase, the agreed
    project will be developed, and the client company''s staff will be trained in
    the use of the platform. Finally, in the Roll-out phase, the access credentials
    will be shared with the company and all the actors identified during the analysis
    phase.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The timescale required to complete all phases and have Trusty operational vary
    according to the project's complexity and may range from a minimum of 2 up to
    a maximum of 6 months. Once Trusty is operational, assistance and maintenance
    are simple and do not require any particular or complex task. As we have seen
    in the previous paragraphs, direct costs for the client company depend on the
    package they choose. In any case, approaching the expenses from the company's
    point of view and including all opportunity costs, we must also include the expenses
    related to the person who must be freed from their current jobs. In the initial
    phase, one or two people are typically trained to use the platform. This starts
    from the analysis phase, which is done in synergy with 1 or 2 people from the
    client company. Collaboration at this stage also increases the level of satisfaction
    once the platform is implemented. This is followed by the training of the company's
    staff. During the training, the company's employees are trained on the platform,
    on the public page, on storytelling, certified info, and the technologies used.
    Indicatively, one day a week for a month is required for the people that the client
    company decides to dedicate to the project with Trusty. Furthermore, we can see
    how the Free package is offered for free with a low or zero initial cost. However,
    it has a high price for a company in terms of employees dedicated almost daily
    to manually entering data within the platform. On the contrary, the more elaborate
    packages integrate much automation that decreases the running costs of Trusty.
    The higher the price paid for the solution, the higher the level of automation,
    the lower the opportunity cost due to dedicated internal staff required to make
    Trusty running.

    application to an SME. Pastificio Mancini (https://www.pastamancini.com) is based
    in the central region of Marche, Italy. It was founded in 2010 by Massimo Mancini,
    and today it counts 35 employees with an annual turnover of around € 3,5 Million.
    The primary market for its products is Italy, however, about 30% of the products
    are exported, mainly to the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Russia.
    The pasta produced by Pastificio Mancini has a quality and price above the average.
    Therefore, customers of Pasta Mancini are mainly chefs and premium consumers.
    The formers look for excellent quality raw materials to raise the standard of
    their services. This type of customer is focused on the product, its origin, and
    characteristics to be told as a unique story of values ​​“from farm to fork”.
    Over the years, Pastificio Mancini has developed a series of best practices to
    satisfy the quality demands of this high-level clientele. High quality is achieved
    through in-house management of the entire production chain, from the cultivation
    of raw materials to the delivery of the product to the final consumer. Pastificio
    Mancini deals directly with selecting the seed to be planted, the management of
    the fields in which wheat crops are alternated with other crops to regenerate
    the soil, the harvesting of the cereal and storage. The whole agricultural process
    is carried out in compliance with Good Agricultural Practice (BPA), which contains
    all the rules applied to have the raw material of the highest quality and healthiness
    while respecting the environment. Pastificio Mancini then deals with the transformation
    of the raw material into pasta. This process also follows strict rules for grinding
    wheat, bronze drawing, pasta drying up to the packaging that must respect the
    environment. Given all the efforts made to achieve these standards of quality
    and respect for the environment, Pastificio Mancini needs to have a tool to communicate
    these efforts to its customers. Indeed, traceability and secure information can
    play a strategic role to influence and confirm customers' choices. The most suitable
    tool to reach this goal was identified in the blockchain and the solution developed
    by Apio.

- en: Apio and Pastificio Mancini work together to create a digital identity for the
    pasta made by the company. With Trusty, Pasta Mancini is one of the first food
    companies that open a direct communication channel with its customers. From January
    2021, through a QR code printed on the label of the pasta’s packaging, the company
    open up a virtual window in the whole company's supply chain (Figure 4). QR codes
    connect the costumers with the product's identity, distinguishing it from other
    brands and information written on the blockchain. By scanning the QR code placed
    on the bottom of the new packages, the customers have access to a web page where
    they can know instantly and without intermediaries all the information about that
    specific pack of pasta. Moreover, the manufacturer can customise the webspace
    with documents, including descriptions and certificates, photos, videos, creative
    content, and all the information that the consumer needs to immerse himself in
    the brand's story. Trusty creates a digital space that breaks down the barriers
    between producers and consumers, establishing an authentic and transparent relationship
    of trust.

- en: 'From an operational point of view, the project developed for Pasta Mancini
    is a Trusty Premium package. Pasta Mancini transforms the raw materials from wheat
    to pasta, and therefore it wants to share information, photos, and documents about
    every batch of pasta. In addition, Pastificio Mancini aims to track wheat fields,
    automate data entry and automate QR codes printing on products through blockchain
    and the internet of things. To achieve the Pasta Mancini Goals, Apio implemented
    the following stages: analysis of the company''s data model; creation of the company
    in the platform (and associated users); data entry for facilities; data-entry
    for products; micro-services for data entry automation; public page customization
    (Table 2). The first step is the analysis of the company''s data model. In this
    phase, Apio carries out research of the company and all its products. During the
    product analysis, for each product, the information that Pastificio Mancini wants
    to share with the consumer is identified through an analysis of the elements of
    value that the company is interested in communicating. The parts of the supply-chain
    chosen are the same for all 103 products of Pastificio Mancini and are four: threshing,
    milling, drawing, and packaging. For each of these four phases, the company''s
    data model is analyzed. The company’s data model is the methodology applied by
    the company to collect the data of these four elements of value. It is interesting
    to see that for all Pastificio Mancini products, the same four elements of value
    were identified. Consequently, all products are described in the same way. This
    has considerably simplified the work required compared to projects where the part
    of the supply chain are different for each product.'

- en: The second phase is the creation of the company and associated users in the
    platform. It is a process that is carried out the first time that a company joins
    the Trusty platform. Apio creates the client company's account on Trusty and,
    at the same time, the profiles of the users who can modify the company's information.
    Once the company is into the platform, the profile of the company, the facilities,
    and the individual products are created. For the company, Apio declares on Trusty,
    the company description, the website, the geographical information, and other
    information that the client company wants to communicate. For the facilities,
    the name, traceability codes, and location. While for the products, the process
    is longer. Apio created for all the 103 products sold by Pastificio Mancini, a
    photo of the product, a background photo, a description of the product, and other
    additional information such as the cooking times. After creating the single product
    sheets, Apio creates the four parts of the supply chain for each product.

- en: The next phase is the development of microservices for automated data entry.
    Until now, none of the information entered on Trusty uses blockchain technology.
    It was only the construction of a structure to create the company profile on Trusty.
    From this stage, we begin to develop and build the tools for entering traceability
    information. Trusty provides several possibilities for inserting traceability
    information on the blockchain, ranging from manual entry by the company to the
    automatic transmission of data on the blockchain through IoT sensors. In the case
    of Pastificio Mancini, an intermediate solution was applied. It provides the automatic
    insertion of data on the blockchain from the company's information system. Apio
    created a software automation system that integrates Trusty with the Pastificio
    Mancini existing Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to make it possible. This
    Software performs an automatic daily analysis of the information that Pastificio
    Mancini has in its MES and records the new ones on the blockchain. This procedure
    takes place every evening and relieves Pastificio Mancini from the burden of manually
    entering information, thereby also limiting the possibility of error. A further
    step, carried out in Pastificio Mancini, consists of the printing automation of
    the QR code in the product packaging by making Trusty communicate with the printing
    machine through an API. In fact, in this case, the QR codes printed in the packs
    of pasta are all different and specific to the product inside each pack. To make
    this possible, it is necessary to create particular QR codes and communicate them
    to the printer, who must print the correct QR code. This solution increases the
    informative potential of the Trusty service. The last phase is the customization
    of the public page. This step consists of customizing the web page that the customers
    have access through the QR code. It must be in line with the graphic style and
    Design desired by Pastificio Mancini. Therefore, the corporate colours, the template,
    and the images are customized to be consistent with the style and communication
    strategy of Pastificio Mancini.

    blockchain used to record the information. Trusty follows an agnostic approach.
    Therefore, with Trusty, it is possible to record information on many blockchains
    according to the customer''s needs and requests. In the case of Pastificio Mancini,
    the Bitcoin public blockchain was chosen. Even before the invention of blockchain,
    companies'' traceability information was declared, so the fact of communicating
    traceability information is not new. The novelty lies in using an external platform
    that guarantees the notarization of the information and its immutability once
    registered. They chose Bitcoin for mainly two: efficiency reasons due to the Open
    Timestamp protocol; it is public, reliable, and completely independent.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starting from the first point, the notarization on Bitcoin takes place with
    a standard procedure using an open-source protocol called Open Timestamp. Open
    Timestamp provides a standard format for time stamping on Bitcoin. Time stamping
    demonstrates in an unchangeable way that certain data existed before a specific
    date. Open Timestamp is a widely developed and tested protocol with a lot of documentation
    available, commonly accepted, and reliable. Furthermore, one of the main advantages
    of this protocol is the limited transaction costs required to record information
    on the blockchain. Recording information on the blockchain is not free, but transaction
    costs vary based on various factors. Open Timestamp allows you to take advantage
    of the network to reduce these costs. The protocol aggregates a packet of information
    and inserts it into the blockchain every two hours by performing a single transaction.
    This allows you to divide the registration costs among all the subjects who have
    entered the information in the package. From a practical point of view, Trusty
    creates a PDF file with the MES of Pastificio Mancini information that must be
    entered on the blockchain. The file is then placed in a package with other information
    that, through Open Timestamp, are recorded on Bitcoin. The Open Timestamp output
    is an OTS file with all the information of the Merkle Tree.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second point is that Bitcoin is the first blockchain platform created, so
    it is very widespread, increasing its solidity. Furthermore, it is a public blockchain.
    Therefore, it is the ideal choice to protect the consumer of the products registered
    in it. It is entirely independent of the producers who cannot modify the information
    once it has been entered on the Bitcoin blockchain. With a solution of this type,
    once the data has been entered on the blockchain, he would have only two possibilities
    if a producer wants to “cheat” the consumer. To declare to have lost the PDF and
    OTS files that the blockchain generates once the data has been recorded or record
    the information multiple times with multiple PDF files. In the first case, the
    role played by Trusty limits this possibility because Trusty keeps all the files
    related to the notarization on blockchain always organized and present. In the
    second case, the final consumer can always see all the recorded files and the
    dates on which they were recorded. By comparing these documents, he can understand
    any changes that would lead to a lack of consumer trust in the manufacturer if
    the manufacturing company did not adequately justify them.

    aspects about the blockchain application that need to be discussed. These aspects
    are: the needs of the SMEs that intend to use blockchain; the agnostic approach
    to the blockchain; the differences in strategic requirements between B2B customers
    and B2C. Trusty is designed mainly for small and medium enterprises, which, due
    to their size, do not have the economic and technological resources of the large
    enterprises. In the attempt to promote IBM Food Trust among SMEs, Apio realized
    that they need blockchain mainly for marketing purposes to communicate the excellence
    of their brands and products. If, on the one hand, there are companies like Walmart
    or Maersk that have been using the blockchain developed by IBM to track their
    supply chains for years, on the other, there are a significant number of SMEs
    that have different needs and problems. However, IBM Food Trust is one of the
    largest networks that connects participants across the food supply chain through
    a Distributed Ledger Technology. IBM Food Trust offers to the company that joins
    the network benefits such as: supply chain efficiencies, brand trust, food safety,
    and so on. The IBM Food Trust solution was, therefore, mainly aimed at making
    the supply chain more efficient. This is a long and complex process that requires
    the collaboration of all actors in the supply chain and a considerable amount
    of time to get up and running effectively (Roettgers, 2020). Otherwise, those
    kinds of benefits are crucial for large organizations with an international and
    anonymous supply chain composed of thousands of suppliers; on the other side,
    SMEs are most interested in creating a Direct-to-Consumer Channel to improve the
    Brand Positioning and Brand Awareness. Moreover, the onboarding process on IBM
    Food Trust requires several identifiers (GS1 Identifiers, GLN Identifiers, and
    GTIN Identifiers) that usually are not quickly available in a small and medium
    enterprise. The most crucial feature of IBM Food Trust is linked to Track and
    Trace. IBM Food Trust gives every supplier the possibility to access information
    about food products. The main challenge of this kind of approach is that there
    is no guarantee that workers at all the businesses in a company''s supply chain
    will insert data, and there are not incentives for suppliers to log everything
    in blockchain correctly (Roettgers, 2020). While large companies like Walmart
    can force their suppliers and companies to take part in blockchain and traceability
    systems taking advantage of their role as the group leader or leading distributors,
    this is not possible for SMEs. Apio has decided to develop Trusty to place itself
    in this market niche left uncovered by the best-known solutions to meet the needs
    of SMEs. For this reason, Trusty provides a series of packages that can be modulated
    according to the needs and financial resources of the company. From this perspective,
    the plan offered for free by Trusty plays a fundamental role in favouring the
    mass adoption of blockchain technology. Moreover, thanks to the agnostic approach,
    Trusty can modulate the costs, and the level of service offered, offering the
    choice between blockchains with less economic and management costs or others more
    expensive but also with a better service.'

- en: 'Adopting a blockchain agnostic approach means that the platform, in this case,
    Trusty, can support many blockchains without preferring any in particular (Nasdaq,
    2017). Trusty''s current implementation can notaries traceability events with:
    Bitcoin, IBM Food Trust, and Ethereum (included Ethereum side chains such as XDai
    and VSC). Using one blockchain rather than another in a project depends mainly
    on the needs of the client company and its economic resources. We have already
    seen that Bitcoin, thanks to the Open Timestamp protocol, allows containing costs
    and, at the same time to record information in one of the most solid and reliable
    blockchains. However, it does not allow you to register the identity. Identity
    consists of the association of data on the blockchain with the public key of the
    actor who reported it. In Bitcoin, with Open Timestamp, it is not the client company
    that records the information directly but the Open Timestamp protocol to which
    Trusty provides the data. This could represent limitations for some companies
    wishing to register also the identity. Thanks to the agnostic approach for companies
    with this need, Trusty can provide its Ethereum-based solution where it is possible
    to write identity. Similarly, for larger companies that need to improve long and
    complex supply chains, Trusty can suggest IBM Food Trust. While on the one hand,
    the agnostic approach represents a solution to best satisfy the client company''s
    requests; on the other, it represents insurance for the future of Trusty itself.
    Using an agnostic approach is consistent with the development phase of the technology
    because a standard has not yet been identified, and consequently, there is no
    certainty about the future (Abuhantash et al., 2019). If this standard is determined,
    Trusty must be ready to include that blockchain and that technology in its system.
    Otherwise, it risks being out of the market. From this perspective, adopting an
    agnostic approach is an insurance towards a context characterized by sudden changes
    and the future not yet defined (Abuhantash et al., 2019).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another interesting issue that the Pastificio Mancini case raises concerns the
    different strategic reasons that determine the use of Trusty by companies that
    have the consumer as their final customer (B2C), and companies that sell their
    products to other companies (B2B). The communication strategy, relevant information,
    and strategic objectives of these two categories are different. Companies that
    sell their products directly to the final consumer in a B2C perspective choose
    Trusty to pursue “customer relationship management” strategies mainly. This strategy
    consists of increasing the business and customers by ensuring their satisfaction
    with the company and its products (Strauss and Frost, 2014). A common practice
    in this strategy is to create contact points with the client and give them all
    the necessary information at every possible opportunity (Strauss and Frost, 2014).
    Thanks to Trusty, a new point of contact is created between the customer and the
    manufacturing company, and the information is communicated more securely and directly.
    On the contrary, in the case of Pastificio Mancini, most of its customers are
    B2B customers. They are part of the HORECA sector, including hotels, restaurants,
    trattorias, pizzerias, bars, catering, etc. Pastificio Mancini sells a small amount
    of its products to the final consumer. In this case, Trusty helps Pastificio Mancini
    to pursue an ingredient branding strategy (Gassmann et al., 2013). This strategy
    is accomplished when a product is purchased as a part or ingredient of another
    product. The ingredient product is advertised as a significant component of the
    final product that elevates its characteristics and performance (Gassmann et al.,
    2013). The product ingredient increases the perceived quality of the final product
    within which it is inserted in the eyes of the final consumer. Perhaps the most
    famous example of this strategy is Intel Inside. The Intel Inside label placed
    on Intel-based PCs is a strategy to communicate to the consumer the quality of
    a PC's processor, ensuring him of the performance and durability characteristics
    of the computer as a whole. Similarly, in our example, Mancini Pasta becomes a
    fundamental ingredient of the Chef's dishes capable of raising its quality and
    ensuring its origin. Therefore, on the one hand, the Chef can ask the end customer
    for a premium price due to the high quality of the raw material used in his dishes,
    on the other hand, Pastificio Mancini makes his products known. Furthermore, for
    the Chef, traceability through Trusty becomes a form of guarantee that allows
    him to demonstrate the origin of the products he uses to his customers. In the
    case of problems related to flawed or poor-quality products, the Chef can easily
    trace the packages to be eliminated, always guaranteeing the customer a high-level
    service.

- en: 'The application of Trusty to the Pastificio Mancini case has clear advantages,
    however, some weaknesses need to be discussed. In this section, we identify three
    weaknesses: the limits of Bitcoin and Open Timestamp; the difficulties in introducing
    blockchain in SMEs; the fully integrated value chain compared with a more disaggregated
    value chain. The use of Bitcoin and Open Timestamps has some advantages in terms
    of ease of use and limited costs. However, it also has disadvantages. The most
    obvious of these is the possibility of proving the Timestamp but not the actor''s
    identity who records the information. Identity consists of the association of
    data with the public key of the actor who registered it. Through identity, it
    is possible to demonstrate that specific information has been written by a specific
    public key attributable to a company. Using Open Timestamp, the data is aggregated
    into packets and recorded on Bitcoin by the Open Timestamp protocol. With this
    solution on the blockchain, it can be seen that the Open Timestamp protocol enters
    the information and that Trusty generated the PDF with the data. Therefore, it
    does not appear on the blockchain that the information was written on the blockchain
    by Pastificio Mancini. This is a solvable problem. Thanks to the agnostic approach
    adopted by Trusty, it is possible to use other blockchains that allow identity
    registration, such as Ethereum. However, the costs of solutions that enable identity
    registration are significantly higher due to the transaction costs required to
    register every transaction on the blockchain. Furthermore, to date, there is not
    commonly recognized open-source protocol such as Open Timestamp on Ethereum. Consequently,
    they would have to develop a protocol internally with the associated costs. For
    the needs of Pastificio Mancini, it was not necessary to resort to solutions of
    this type. Another aspect of weakness linked to the Pastificio Mancini case is
    in the data entry phase. In the case of Pastificio Mancini, the data are taken
    by Trusty from the company''s MES. This could leave some space for possible scams.
    Trusty or Pastificio Mancini itself could tamper with the data before it is recorded
    on the blockchain. The solution presented in this case involves a certain measure
    of consumer trust in Trusty and Pastificio Mancini. This does not precisely meet
    the trustless relationship expectations that the blockchain promises to achieve.
    Again, in this case, the problem is easily solvable because Trusty allows more
    advanced solutions. Data are recorded directly on the blockchain by IoT sensors
    placed on the plants, limiting as much as possible any form of intermediation
    and eliminating any possibility of a cheat. What we have seen with Pastificio
    Mancini is a simple approach that allows containing costs. This is the approach
    chosen by most of the SMEs who turn to Trusty to approach blockchain technology,
    intending to adopt more advanced solutions if they see a tangible advantage. Therefore,
    if, on the one hand, the approach used in the Pastificio Mancini case has limitations,
    on the other hand, it is essential to bring SMEs closer to blockchain technology.
    SMEs often do not know blockchain and are not willing to invest tens of thousands
    of euros without first understanding the advantages. The Trusty approach allows
    SMEs to gradually increase blockchain adoption in terms of the solution complexity
    and required investment. Without a flexible and modular approach, Trusty''s customers
    would be forced to make a considerable investment upfront to adopt blockchain.
    Most SMEs may be deterred by this investment and may choose not to use blockchain.
    The Trusty team evaluated the gradual approach to the blockchain as the best solution
    in this phase of development of the technology.'

- en: Although the modularity of the service offered by Trusty facilitates home boarding,
    this is not enough to solve the adoption of this technology by SMEs. One of the
    most relevant challenges faced by Trusty is due to the characteristics of the
    Italian SMEs, which make the onboarding process complex and expensive in most
    cases. While large companies have developed information systems and relevant internal
    skills to which it is possible to connect Trusty, in most of the SMEs, this has
    not happened. So, right now, the biggest weakness of the solution is related to
    scalability. The level of digitization of Italian SMEs is so low that the onboarding
    activity must often be accompanied by professional resources that identify virtuous
    paths for companies. Trusty must engage not only in the traceability service through
    blockchain but very often it must provide for a minimum digitization path to make
    it possible to use Trusty itself. This limit slows down the adoption process and
    does not fit well with Software as a service business model based on rapid customer
    acquisition and conversion. The solution's novelty, the lack of knowledge of the
    blockchain of agri-food companies, and the legislative vacuum on the subject also
    slow down investments in this area. Finally, we cannot refrain from recognizing
    that the case of Pastificio Mancini is particular and relatively simple. Pastificio
    Mancini has a vertically integrated supply chain and directly controls every step
    of the supply chain. Therefore, it is easy for Pastificio Mancini to carry out
    traceability of its supply chain since it is not necessary for the blockchain
    to be adopted by other actors in the supply chain to be effective. On the contrary,
    in the case of very disintegrated supply chains with a plurality of actors, perhaps
    in international contexts, the adoption is more complex. If, on the one hand,
    the benefits of blockchain in situations of this type are greater, on the other
    hand, all the actors in the supply chain must adopt the blockchain. If one actor
    in the supply chain decides not to use it, the chain falls, and the solution becomes
    useless for all the other actors.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, the authors analyzed the Trusty case study. A case of application
    of the blockchain to SMEs in the Agrifood sector is undergoing substantial changes
    due to more aware and informed consumers. Consumers are increasingly paying attention
    to healthy, high-quality and environmentally friendly products. While it is growing
    the need for businesses to have a simple and affordable tool to effectively and
    securely make visible their efforts in a mutable and sustainable market environment,
    Trusty represents a possible solution, that leverages blockchain, to give SMEs
    these tools. The analysis of Trusty and the case of application of Trusty to Pastificio
    Mancini allowed us to discuss some interesting issues that we have summarized
    in Table 3\. The first topic is the blockchain application to SMEs. A considerable
    part of SMEs shows different needs compared to large companies (that use blockchain
    mainly to lower cost and wastes along their supply chain). SMEs seem more interested
    in communicating the quality of their products directly and reliably to their
    customers. This represents an opportunity for Trusty and a strength of the solution
    developed by Trusty. At the same time, the application of Blockchain to SMEs encounters
    considerable challenges given the limited budget of these companies and their
    often low level of digitalization. The second overarching issue concerns the type
    of blockchain used for notarization and traceability solutions such as Trusty.
    The agnostic approach used by Trusty is an excellent solution does not commit
    to a specific blockchain from the beginning, neither Trusty nor Pastificio Mancini.
    This represents an opportunity and an advantage both in strategic and economic
    terms. In fact, if in the future a standard blockchain for operations of this
    type will emerge, Trusty would be ready to adopt it. From a cost point of view,
    some blockchains allow information to be notarized at lower costs, therefore they
    are ideal for certain SMEs that do not have particularly complex needs. However,
    Blockchains with limited expenses such as Open Timestamp also have significant
    limitations, such as the inability to register the identity. Finally, some specific
    issues emerged in the case of Trusty's application to Pastificio Mancini. Pastificio
    Mancini sells almost all of its products in the HORECA channel. Consequently,
    these products are purchased by highly competent people who include them as an
    ingredient in their dishes. As a result, their information needs are different
    from customers who buy pasta at the supermarket. Furthermore, the Pastificio Mancini
    case has a fully integrated value chain, from raw materials to the finished product,
    in these conditions, applying the blockchain for traceability reasons are easier
    than in companies that have a very disaggregated value chain.
