    interest in the area of asset tokenization. Going back to the days of Bitcoin’s
    “colored coins,” developers saw the opportunity in tracking ownership on a blockchain-based
    asset, thereby enabling secure asset transfers in a peer-to-peer form. Thenceforth,
    innovators have been creating protocols to modernize the methods by which asset
    creation, representation and ownership transfers occur online, most notably in
    the digital securities industry.

- en: A blockchain is a distributed database structure that records transactions on
    a digital ledger, providing users with a secure and transparent history of events.
    In our ever increasing digital world, where countless amounts of data are vulnerable
    to alteration and theft, a blockchain’s composition provides enhanced security
    and assurance to its users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As noted in previous chapters, blockchain security is built on the concepts
    of consensus and tamper-resistance. Consensus is achieved when network devices
    confirm both the reliability of transactions and the true state of a system. Once
    transactions are confirmed, the records of a blockchain are considered tamper-resistant,
    meaning they cannot be altered without an overriding consensus. Moreover, cryptography
    plays a key role in blockchain data security. Cryptographic hashing algorithms
    help protect the ledger’s transaction data by generating encryption keys to encrypt
    and decrypt pieces of information. Asymmetric cryptography, or public key cryptography
    (PKC), is used to secure digital asset wallets, ensuring that only the intended
    users have access.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast with symmetric encryption algorithms, which use the same key to
    encrypt and decrypt data, PKC algorithms use one key for encryption (public key)
    and another key for decryption (private key). Digital asset wallet addresses are
    generated using public keys, allowing them to be safely shared with others. Private
    keys are used for digital signature creation and transaction verification; transactions
    are verified and added to the ledger after confirming the hash within the digital
    signature. Asymmetric cryptography systems are widely used throughout the digital
    assets industry to enhance transaction security, as asset transfers can only be
    authorized using the private key associated with its corresponding digital wallet.

    offering a medium to transform financial products into cryptographically-secured
    digital tokens; these digital assets can be issued and transferred on DLT networks.
    DLT systems are modernizing financial services infrastructure and related processes,
    by creating shared data structures (ledgers) of electronic records that are authenticated
    through multiparty consensus mechanisms. As such, digital asset transactions are
    recorded in real time on an authoritative ledger that is readily available to
    appropriate network users. As discussed in detail in a later chapter, the DLT
    network model can eliminate or facilitate the reporting and auditing process to
    reduce costs and provide greater assurance. Financial instruments and related
    procedures are further transformed when integrating smart contracts into DLT systems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned in earlier chapters, smart contracts are protocols that digitally
    facilitate the performance of previously agreed upon terms and procedures. Transactions
    executed through smart contracts are conditional, as the underlying code follows
    “if, then” logic statements, meaning if a requirement is satisfied, then an action
    occurs. Smart contract activity is recorded on a distributed ledger, making all
    transactions trackable and tamper-resistant. The unique characteristics of smart
    contracts assure reliable transaction execution without third parties, resulting
    in reduced operating and transaction costs.

    database structures when automating software. However, DLT smart contracts can

    participants. Likewise, the distributed computing platform “Ethereum” offers a

    cap of real estate private funds that invested in Japanese domestic real estate
    totaled 17.7 trillion JPY (about 160 billion USD) in early 2019\. When factoring
    in Japanese real estate investment trusts (J-REITs), which accounted for 17.9
    trillion yen, the Japanese real estate market had nearly 36 trillion yen (about
    340 billion USD) of assets under management. These results are illustrated in
    [Fig. 10.7](#fig7) found in SMTRI’s 27th “Survey on Private Real Estate Funds.”
    Note that while the portion of private funds has remained relatively steady over
    the years, the majority of growth in assets under management has been fueled by
    J-REITs.

    policies that facilitate cheap financing markets, fueling real estate demand.
