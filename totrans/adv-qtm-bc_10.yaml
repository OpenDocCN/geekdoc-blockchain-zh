- en: Smart cities are a futuristic urban development concept that uses ICT to enable
    citizens, governments, and organizations to collect and share real-time data.
    Q-BoC technology can provide a new level of convenience and security for communication
    and transactions among all of a smart city's many stakeholders. Information technology,
    including quantum blockchain, has been integrated to govern physical, social,
    and business infrastructures in today's rapidly developing smart cities. Innovative
    technologies and concepts such as the IoT, 5G, artificial intelligence, and quantum
    blockchain have become necessary for an intelligent and advanced society. In recent
    years, both academics and industry have demonstrated a strong interest in the
    revolution of smart cities. Smart cities can deliver a variety of smart functions,
    such as intelligent transportation, Industry 5.0, governance, Healthcare 5.0,
    and smart banking, to improve people's quality of life. The chapter explores the
    application, challenges, and opportunities for making a smart society.

- en: Blockchain is a novel computer expertise application method that includes distributed
    data storage, point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanics, and an encryption
    technique ([Aggarwal et al., 2019](#r2)). In Blockchain, every node has its own
    allocated ledger for keeping transaction history. All the nodes are joints that
    validate all the blockchain rules. These nodes organize transactions into blocks
    and determine which genuine transactions should be included in the Blockchain.
    Communication and trust between nodes in a blockchain network are riled on digital
    signature technology, which primarily enables information identification, authenticity,
    and integrity verification ([Alam, 2021](#r5)). According to ([Bhavin et al.,
    2021](#r9)), Blockchain is a modern technology system in which the sequence of
    cryptographic blocks is linked together to form a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P)
    net. Blockchain can accomplish validation, authorization, answerability, safety,
    integrity, privacy, and non-repudiation for real-time applications that a centralized
    system may not provide effectively in a smart community position. Similarly, ([Kappert
    et al., 2021](#r30)) discussed several blockchain-based consensus techniques and
    their efficiency and viability in various submissions. ([Sun et al., 2016](#r54))
    investigated edge-centric IoT and cloud-centrical IoT structures, highlighting
    several safety measures for such decentralized methods. They also investigated
    the security issues that come with using Blockchain.

    that arise in an IoT setting. ([Shalendra Singh Rao, n.d.](#r48); [Solaiman et
    al., 2021](#r52)) investigated numerous safety threats to blockchain and damage
    consequences and proposed several strategies for improving security in an allocated
    system. ([Ahl et al., 2020](#r4)) examined the function of distributed ledger
    in the regional energy marketplace and smart grids' transactive energy controlling
    structure. Augmented reality, AI-ML-IoT system, robotics, and fog computing are
    increasingly driving factors behind global new-age city programs. Similarly, Fog
    computing has significant transportation applications, including, smart traffic
    management control and vechicle management systems also monitoring independent
    automobiles and self-spacing ([Gill et al., 2019](#r26)). Additionally, it is
    a more viable solution because of its low energy consumption and small footprint.
    Governments can employ these apps to improve citizen security and environmental
    stewardship. Moreover, it may be employed as in alternative services such as fire
    and natural disasters by providing early warning of critical circumstances to
    make sound decisions. Because of the ubiquity of Blockchain, several published
    literature studies, such as those shown in [Table 1](#t1) ([P. Sharma et al.,
    2022](#r50)). For Examples, Smart cities ([Costa & Peixoto, 2020](#r14)), IoT
    ([Sun et al., 2016](#r54)), cloud ([Selvaraj & Sundaravaradhan, 2020](#r45)),

    currency ([C. Li et al., 2019](#r37)), smart grid ([Sengupta et al., 2020](#r46)),
    infrastructure ([Haji, 2021](#r27)), smart agriculture ([Gill et al., 2019](#r26)),

    models appears to be understudied. Furthermore, despite its potential, current
    studies have not focused on the role of Q-BoC in implementing security and secrecy
    aspects in smart societies. As a result, we evaluate Q-BoC's utility, applications,
    challenges, and opportunities in various smart communities in this study. Smart
    governance, cloud, e-voting, SCM, infrastructure, telecom, smart home, IoT, finance,
    healthcare, biometric, industry 4.0, digital currency, surveillance, energy, and
    smart cities are predominantly explored by the study.

- en: ([Birda, 2019](#r10)) studied that a smart city's varied character makes it
    vulnerable to attacks, particularly at the level of resource-constrained devices
    when high-level security protocols cannot be implemented. Furthermore, the smart
    city's centralized structure encourages illegal data retention and manipulation
    by specific persons or groups; these groups might even prevent the passage of
    signals from one participant to another. ([Fernandez-Carames & Fraga-Lamas, 2020](#r23))
    applied Blockchain to construct Block-VN, a vehicle network planning in a smart
    town. The proposed architecture proved secure and ran in a distributed manner
    to construct a new distributed transport management system. Several additional
    studies ([Gill et al., 2019](#r26); [Hebert & Di Cerbo, 2019](#r28); [Kappert
    et al., 2021](#r30)) have successfully combined Blockchain with smart cities.
    (Manish Dadhich et al., 2019; [Srinivas Aditya et al., 2021](#r53)) introduced
    a novel authentication and encryption protocol inspired by quantum walks (QIQW).
    The suggested protocol provides a blockchain agenda for securely exchanging data
    between IoT devices. Rather than employing traditional cryptographic hash functions
    to link the chain's blocks and quantum botch purposes. The framework's primary
    benefits include enabling IoT nodes to communicate data with other nodes successfully
    while maintaining complete control over their records.

    that may enable a unified decentralization progression. Moreover, the study discussed
    the various applications for upcoming smart grid action. Additionally, the article
    concisely examines the blockchain integration problems, ensuring the decentralized
    functioning of future autonomous electrical networks is secure and scalable. In
    this regard ([Van Den Bosch, 2020](#r56)) proposed the concept of a smart city
    as a city that integrates technology into its human-centric agenda. Based on a
    conceptual framework, (Manish [Dadhich, Purohit, et al., 2021](#r22); [Sun et
    al., 2016](#r54)) examined how Q-BoC based sharing facilities can build smart
    cities. They also believe that Quantum Blockchain will pique interest in theory
    and practice, encouraging further discussion in this field. ([M. Dadhich et al.,
    2018](#r21); [Srinivas Aditya et al., 2021](#r53)) examined the fundamental requirements
    and technical obstacles that robots face in general. It provides a comprehensive
    understanding of blockchain technology in a lecture format. Then, the part of
    Blockchain in various robotics applications is discussed. Additionally, numerous
    technological hurdles that must be overcome to realize the budding of Blockchain
    for robots are emphasized.

    and judged, and the shortcomings and deficiencies in the building of innovative
    smarter cities are examined. They also discussed the policy recommendations to
    promote development (Q-BoC) in smart cities. It serves as a valuable reference
    for comprehending China's innovation's development concept and overall development
    state. The most significant Blockchain-based solutions developed in recent years
    address the issues highlighted by traditional cloud-based apps (Manish [Dadhich,

    services, and various other amenities must be enhanced or reinvented ([Casino
    et al., 2019](#r13); Manish [Dadhich et al., 2022](#r20)). It is vital to note
    that the expansion of smart cities includes the development of high-tech structures
    and the participation of residents in the conveyance and development of amenities.
    This may be accomplished by collecting and distributing data to end-users and
    choice-makers to accomplish the smart city system. This objective may be reached
    by adopting synchronized procedures in digital systems. Developing machinery,
    viz. data science, AI, cloud and IoT, enables participation and collaborative
    evolution. Several studies ([Alam, 2021](#r5); [Bhavin et al., 2021](#r9); [Brotsis
    et al., 2021](#r12); [Casino et al., 2019](#r13); [Fernandez-Carames & Fraga-Lamas,
    2020](#r23)) and reports have said that the evolution to smart cities would be
    undertaken progressively to confirm accomplishment and sustainability, tackling
    the most unrelenting challenges that influence people's lives. Utilities (such
    as water, food and electricity) are among the most sensitive components of smart
    cities since they provide essential services to all people.

    the foundation for global innovation. Cities support information interchange,
    capacity structure, and the supply of knowledge-rigorous business facilities through
    their fundamental infrastructure. This necessitates the construction of trustworthy
    frameworks using Q-BoC to better steer socio-economic development in metropolitan
    areas ([Casino et al., 2019](#r13); [R. Sharma et al., 2020](#r51); [Tribis et
    al., 2018](#r55)). Cities are attracting a growing percentage of the world's population.
    In 2014, metropolitan regions housed 56% of the world's population; statistics
    anticipated increasing to 67% by 2050\. Cities are becoming more important in
    the economics and well-being of nations, with cities accounting for most of the
    economic activity ([Pólvora et al., 2020](#r42)). Cities simultaneously have administrative,
    organizational, logistical, social, and environmental issues. Improved administrative
    efficiency, new models for public participation, and a better understanding of
    the value of electronic information and the need to secure it transform the relationship
    between cities and their inhabitants.

    can improve the energy market system's transparency and confidence while ensuring
    accountability while respecting privacy rules and increasing its efficiency. According
    to ([Bhavin et al., 2021](#r9)), blockchain technology might also be used to create
    peer-to-peer energy transactions and energy managing schemes for electric vehicles.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: New hazards accompany the recompense of smart cities. For example, IoT devices
    that are heavily used as vital structures (e.g., water systems, which might influence
    residents' health and safety) are vulnerable to cyber-assaults ([Sengupta et al.,
    2020](#r46)). As a result, it is critical to continually monitor and regulate
    service networks to reduce the risk of assaults on information and functioning
    technologies, resulting in cities being wiser and more useful places to live.
    The term 'smart water system' denotes technological and societal advancements
    that enable the improved delivery, usage, administration, and optimization of
    water utility services. Investment in interacting and communication structures,
    data gathering and assessment, social and crowdsourcing tools, rules and information
    safety are required to implement effective smart utilities on both the technical
    and social fronts ([Bhavin et al., 2021](#r9); M. dadhich & [N. Kumar, 2015](#r34)).
    Conventional data administration of smart utilities is typically managed on centralized
    systems in today's information technology architecture. These centralized systems
    are vulnerable in terms of safety and confidentiality. Using Q-BoC to increase
    reliable transmission among smart utility equipment is a viable answer to security
    breaches. Blockchain is a potential method for a decentralized and secure data
    management system that offers tamper-proof immutability and traceability. Thus,
    this section outlines many critical open research challenges that impede the use
    of Q-BoC in smart cities. As seen in [table 2](#t2), opportunities have also been
    discussed based on an extensive literature review.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This work offers a holistic perspective that could be further explored in various
    ways to produce useful research or practical results. Blockchain technologies
    have ushered in a true revolution in which quantum blockchain refers to a decentralized,
    encrypted, and distributed database. Once registered on the quantum blockchain,
    the data will not be interfered with maliciously. The advancement of quantum computers
    and quantum info theory has drawn many researchers to study quantum blockchain
    soon. Further, every node in a blockchain must execute a similar process for each
    transaction's authentication at the same time, incurring a hefty compute cost.
    As a result, creating a lightweight blockchain model is necessary and ideal for
    applications with specific requirements constraints. Q-BoC innovations and their
    use in smart cities to improve quality of life are blistering topics in today's
    research circles. However, numerous obstacles and need limits remain studied and
    handled before blockchain may be used in sustainable metropolitan advancement
    programs. This study can aid academics in identifying and addressing the difficulties
    of building and developing Q-BoC based solutions for IoT-built smart towns. The
    research would serve as a springboard for further research and discussion on the
    applications, challenges, opportunities, design, and implementation of Q-BoC based
    smart city sharing services.

    whether to prioritize consistency or availability. If the network wants to prioritize
    availability, all transactions are added without any downtime. If the network
    wants to prioritize consistency, some transactions might not be processed or halted
    until all the previous transactions are confirmed.'
