- en: Trust is the oil that lubricates the global economy. When we pay for something,
    the merchant releases the goods because she trusts the value of the mechanism
    we have used to pay—whether that’s paper money or a credit card. When we buy a
    house, we’re willing to part with our hard-earned cash because we trust the registration
    documents provided by the seller as proof that the seller owns the house and has
    the right to sell it to us. When an investor buys a company’s bonds, they rely
    on a wider circle of trusted inputs—a grade from an established credit ratings
    agency to help assess financial risk that the bonds represent, reports from the
    company’s auditors for assurance that the company’s finances are in order.

    our paper money because it is backed by the central bank—indeed she is legally
    compelled to accept its value. She accepts a credit card not because she is legally
    compelled to do so, but rather because the card is issued by a trusted network
    such as Visa or Mastercard with a long history of settling transactions. Ownership
    of the house is established by the land registry and various legal searches. When
    applying for a loan, the bank validates our income through statements or tax records
    and uses an independent credit records bureau to ensure that we are not already
    overburdened with debt. When engaging a supplier, a company relies on international
    standards certification (e.g. ISO), which in turn depends on trusted certification
    bodies, and on the effectiveness and integrity of the legal system to enforce
    contracts.

- en: In every transaction, the parties trust a series of intermediaries, lessening
    the need to trust one another directly. Even accounting for occasional high-profile
    failures, these institutions are seen to offer generally reliable assessments.
    These intermediaries did not appear overnight. In developed economies, the web
    of institutions and regulations intrinsic to any transaction evolved over decades
    or centuries. In developing countries, there is often a shorter expanse of time
    behind the trust in their institutions.

- en: These webs of trust are living organisms, changing and iterating as failures
    occur, new needs arise and technology moves on. Where effective and efficient
    systems already exist, the bar is higher for establishing new systems, and their
    impact may be more constrained. In developing economies, more nascent arbiters
    of trust provide opportunity for alternative models to emerge. Many people do
    not have access to banks. Standards bodies are sometimes corrupted or ineffective.
    Contracts might be worth little more than the paper they are printed on. In some
    places, credibility of the national currency is perpetually at risk from inflation,
    exchange rate instability or restrictions on conversion to dollars.

    crisp ones are accepted in places where access to banking is limited. This realization led
    a friend to create a business in rural South America exchanging defaced and damaged
    dollars for new ones. He would buy damaged dollars at a discount and replace them.
    The most spectacular example was a $100 bill that had been eaten by mice; the
    individual pieces had been recovered from the mouse droppings and sown back together.
    He bought this patchwork bill for $60, and it is now in the collection of the
    Dallas Federal Reserve.'

    speed, efficacy and opportunity for transactions. Many developing economies have
    cumbersome or non-existent property registers, stunting real estate transactions.
    For people making their living outside of formal institutions, even something
    as simple as verifying earnings is a challenge. This trust problem permeates across
    many systems in developing countries, from lack of trust in aid distribution to
    lack of trust in elections.

    for sale. Why is this noteworthy? The world over, only a small proportion of real
    estate is on the market for sale at any given time. What makes the situation in
    Nigeria remarkable is that much of the property that is not for sale is labelled
    as such on billboards on empty land or paint daubed on the walls of homes warning:
    “This house is not for sale.”'

    Penal Code outlawing fraud. While scammers, known in Nigeria as 419ers, are renowned
    internationally for their expertly pitched email scams—with just enough misspelling
    to hook the more credulous—a popular scam back home is to sell a property you
    don’t own, pocket the money and disappear before the new buyer encounters the
    real owner.

- en: 419 scams are possible because Nigeria’s institutions are ineffective in securing
    trust in property registration. In most developed countries, an interested buyer
    can quickly check a national or provincial land register online to confirm the
    current ownership of any property. The potential buyer knows that the land register
    includes all of the property in the province and that the relevant agency for
    property registration updates the register whenever there are changes in ownership.
    Should the buyer go ahead with a transaction, they can also be assured that any
    legal dispute over title can, at least in the first instance, be decided fairly
    swiftly. And, for those instances where this system fails, the risk of such failure
    is born not by the transaction participants, but by an intermediary in the form
    of title insurance.

- en: The situation is exactly the opposite in Nigeria. No integrated database of
    property registration exists. Some states keep a mix of electronic and paper records;
    other states, only paper records. If a prospective buyer wants to persist with
    a paper record search, she will first need to find a way to view the database.
    Access is limited. More importantly, the register is not comprehensive even in
    the biggest cities, let alone in rural areas. Should the buyer decide to go ahead
    with a purchase and subsequently find herself in a dispute over title, she should
    expect to wait at least three years for first judgment and further years for any
    subsequent appeals. Title insurance is made practically impossible because there
    is not enough infrastructure or data to build an effective actuary table, even
    for the most determined buyer.

- en: The World Bank Doing Business project has constructed an index to measure the
    quality of property registration institutions globally. Out of a maximum score
    of 30, Nigeria’s range from 9 in Lagos State to 4.5 in Kano State, with the variation
    dependent on the degree of digitization of the process. Sub-Saharan Africa’s major
    economies—with Kenya at 15, South Africa at 15.5—trail middle-income economies,
    such as Malaysia (26.5) and China (24), and developed economies like the UK (26),
    or Japan (25.5).^([1](#Fn1)) That said, African countries are not alone in scoring
    poorly. Notable laggards elsewhere in the world include Greece (4.5), Venezuela
    (5.5) and, relative to developed nation peers, the US (17.6) (Fig. [2.1](#Fig1)).^([2](#Fn2))![../images/467759_1_En_2_Chapter/467759_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467759_1_En_2_Chapter/467759_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png)

- en: The example of weak property registration in Nigeria exposes inadequacies in
    another critical infrastructure to support trust—the legal system. In developed
    economies, legal precedent serves as a distributed system for enforcing norms
    of trust. Though centralized in the creation of law through legislative bodies,
    the administration of law and the mechanism through which it interfaces with reality
    is carried out by a distributed network of judges and juries. Centuries of deliberation
    are documented in the form of legal opinions and judgements, providing a blueprint
    for how trust is to be enforced.

- en: One further key area that the World Bank’s Doing Business project benchmarks
    is the ease of enforcing contracts. While there are plenty of exceptions, developing
    economies overall perform relatively poorly. Even leaving aside potential issues
    of fairness and corruption, one of the most important aspects for a company enforcing
    a contract is how long the legal process will take. If the process drags on, then
    the claimant may go bust long before they receive the benefits of contract enforcement.
    Similarly, if the cost of enforcing the contract is too high relative to the size
    of the claim, a claimant might simply not bother.

- en: To put this in perspective, if we look at the high-income members of the Organisation
    for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), it takes an average 590 days
    to enforce a contract (though with Greece as a notable laggard at 1711 days) and
    at a cost of 21.5% of the contract value. In sub-Saharan Africa the time is not
    much longer at 655 days, but the cost doubles to 41.6% of the contract value.
    By contrast, in both South Asia and Latin America, the increase in cost is less
    substantial, at around 30%, but companies must cope with much more drawn out timelines
    of 1100 days for Latin America. Such situations can be truly debilitating for
    commerce and businesses (Fig. [2.2](#Fig2)).^([3](#Fn3))![../images/467759_1_En_2_Chapter/467759_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/467759_1_En_2_Chapter/467759_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.png)

- en: Could blockchain-based systems augment or replace some of the weak or non-existent
    institutions of trust in developing countries? For property registration as with
    digital identity and contracts, potential applications are starting to take hold.
    However, as we will explore further, while blockchains can provide some elements
    of the solution, the achilles heel lies in creating a set of trusted procedures
    to make sure that the data recorded in these new systems is itself reliable.
