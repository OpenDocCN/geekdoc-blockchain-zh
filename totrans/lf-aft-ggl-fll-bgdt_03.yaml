    philosophy that currently shapes our lives and fortunes, combining a theory of
    knowledge (nicknamed “Big Data”), a technological vision (centralized cloud computing),
    a cult of the commons (rooted in “open source” software), a concept of money and
    value (based on free goods and automated advertising), a theory of morality as
    “gifts” rather than profits, and a view of progress as evolutionary inevitability
    and an ever diminishing “carbon footprint.”

    the globe. With its development of “deep learning” by machines and its hiring
    of the inventor-prophet Raymond Kurzweil in 2014, Google enlisted in a chiliastic
    campaign to blend human and machine cognition. Kurzweil calls it a “singularity,”
    marked by the triumph of computation over human intelligence. Google networks,
    clouds, and server farms could be said to have already accomplished much of it.

    forty-five megabits a second, and ties to such venture capital titans as John
    Doerr, Vinod Khosla, Mike Moritz, and Don Valentine. The computer theorists Terry

    something with a computer, you must translate its corpus into digital form: bits

    company came close to keeping up with the exponential growth of the Internet,
    where traffic and content double every year. Weaving and wrapping copies of the
    URLs (universal resource locators) of the Web in massively parallel automated
    threads of computation, Google’s Web crawler technology has been a miracle. By
    making the Internet’s trove of information readily accessible to the public, and

    Other ads hijacked your screen.”[⁶](notes.html#ch03note-6)'

- en: The genius of Google was to invent a search advertising model that avoids all
    the pitfalls it ascribes to existing practices and establishes a new economic
    model for its system of the world. Google understands that most advertising most
    of the time is value-subtracted. That is, to the viewers, ads are overwhelmingly
    minuses, or even mines. The digital world has accordingly responded with ad-blockers,
    ad-filters, mutes, Tivos, ad-voids, and other devices to help viewers escape the
    minuses, the covert exactions, that pay for their free content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Google led the world in grasping that this model is not only unsustainable but
    also unnecessary. Brin and Page saw that the information conferred by the pattern
    of searches was precisely the information needed to determine what ads viewers
    were likely to welcome. From its search results, it could produce ads that the
    viewer wanted to see. Thus it transformed the ad business for good.

    two-way transaction between publisher and advertiser but a three-way transaction
    including the user.” But in practice, following its rule “to focus on the user
    and all else will follow,” Google made it a one-way appeal to the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    serve the advertiser either and would therefore ultimately threaten the advertising
    intermediaries as well. In the terms of Life after Television, the promise of
    the Internet under Google’s scheme would be that “no one would have to read or
    see any unwanted ads.” Ads would be sought, not fought. To accomplish this goal,
    Google designated its ads as “sponsored links” and charged only for successful
    appeals measured by click-throughs. They used the same measure to calculate an
    ad’s effectiveness and quality, forcing advertisers to improve their ads by removing
    those that did not generate enough click-throughs.

    on websites and advertising performance would readily pay for itself. Showing

    system itself cost money, and it led to queues of valuable Google engineers wasting
    company time as they waited to pay. Cheaper and easier and altogether trans-capitalistically
