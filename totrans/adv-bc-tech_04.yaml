  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a leading agent of growth in e-healthcare
    and supply chain [[1](#CR1)] applications being developed lately. During the nascent
    years of telemedicine [[2](#CR2)], challenges based on technology lacunae kept
    its adaptation low. Still, during recent years, enhanced e-healthcare solutions
    are seeing light of the day with improved network communication over IoT devices
    like IoT-based wearables and sensor-based monitoring devices [[3](#CR3)]. IoT
    has thus emerged as the key technology for smart healthcare applications [[4](#CR4)],
    but the focus of challenges faced by e-healthcare has shifted its base from lack
    of technology to lack of user privacy and security. The challenges can be understood
    in the context that the nature of the data involved in any e-healthcare application
    is considered very personal, and maintenance of its privacy is a legal requirement
    in several countries. The underlying use of a public communication network adds
    new security and privacy challenges to healthcare applications using IoT [[5](#CR5)].
    This is compounded by the fact that IoT devices use small-sized low-performance
    components with limited resource capacity, making it extremely difficult to apply
    the conventional security algorithms and models designed for resource-rich systems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A potential solution to the multiple security challenges explained above in
    the pursuit of IoT-based e-healthcare security is the use of blockchain technology
    [[6](#CR6)]. Blockchain technology is gaining popularity in innumerable technological
    use cases owing mainly to its decentralized, distributed, and immutable transaction
    record keeping. In a blockchain-based application, a shared ledger residing at
    the heart of record keeping maintains a chronological record of transactions distributed
    as shared copies within stakeholders.

    It uses a block of information for storage, chained with cryptographic signatures
    of the previous data blocks called hash, stored in shared ledgers supported by
    distributed network processes called nodes. Each node maintains a copy of the
    complete chain. We propose the concept of “one patient one record chain” to be
    maintained across all the potential organizations as nodes interacting with the
    proposed IoT-based e-healthcare application using blockchain [[7](#CR7)].

- en: Telemedicine is conventionally defined as remote monitoring of patients and
    giving them treatment according to diagnosis using information communication technology.
    The original idea included sharing diagnostic reports through emails and tele-consultation
    thereafter, which evolved into a complete audio-visual consultation through teleconferencing
    services with streaming video services. While the service proved useful for remote
    locations with a scarcity of medical experts, the idea did not gain much traction
    due to several technological and adaptation issues. Healthcare traditionally has
    been an in-person diagnostic and care giving service. The absence of an “in-person”
    factor made it difficult for patients and doctors to adapt to the new paradigm
    of remote healthcare. The streaming video call services on popular messengers
    and communication platforms like WhatsApp, Facetime, Facebook Live, and others
    made the masses comfortable with the idea of “assumed” closeness despite being
    physically distant. This social transformation helped the cause of telemedicine
    well. For the healthcare workers like doctors however, the confidence in technology
    was boosted by real-time health parameter monitoring through sensor-based devices
    which they find is close to their way of working at the hospitals. The e-healthcare
    based on IoT made this transition far easier and adaptable for the healthcare
    providers. The immense opportunities arising from the permeation of smartphones
    equipped with healthcare apps and wearable sensors providing real-time data for
    analytics are taking this evolution forward at a rapid pace today.

    underlying premise that data security is ensured while bringing transparency to
    the system through the elimination of the requirement of third parties for trust,
    storage, and key certification [[15](#CR15)]. We can understand the technology
    by observing that before the existence of blockchain, there was a complete reliance
    on a single centralized authority or server for storage and security. Any breach
    happening at the central server level could compromise data of each individual
    stored at the machine. We can also visualize it as a decentralized data structure
    where data is distributed across all nodes within the sanctioned distributed network.
    Each stakeholder can become a storage/processing node and may keep the complete
    or partial state of the blockchain data on itself [[16](#CR16)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This technology allows for a shared copy of the data, replicated at all participating
    nodes and updated only after establishing consensus among the majority of stakeholders,
    thereby providing security from a corrupted/compromised central authority. The
    consensus protocols are a standard part of blockchain architecture and are needed
    to add transactions on ledger. Various implementations of the consensus algorithms
    [[17](#CR17)] have been proposed and standardized recently. Blockchain technology
    constructs the equivalent of an electronic ledger by adding blocks in chronological
    order on a chain of secure data blocks. In technical terms, the blockchain offers
    decentralized data [[18](#CR18)] with immutability property and a cryptographic
    hash-based consensus.

    a challenge-based analogy. To enter a new block the participant has to solve a
    hard puzzle, only after that new content can be added. The process of solving
    this “puzzle” is called mining and the participants who are vying to add a valid
    block have to perform a complete mining process, which exists in varying degrees
    of hardness depending upon the application. The participants trying to add blocks
    are called miners, and the mining process includes a lot of hits and trials. All
    the nodes which are part of the network create a consensus, that is, a type of
    agreement to accept a block or not upon checking the transaction status.

    Various stakeholders need on-demand access to patient EHR, necessitating that
    the provision of data security must be ensured in e-healthcare. Blockchains bring
    in the desirable technical aspects like immutability, transparency in transactions,
    and auditability of data access. Every stakeholder like the admitting hospital,
    assigned doctors, nurses, health insurance company, and lab staff can request
    granular control over access to the patient information, which is eventually the
    prerogative of the concerned patient or his representative who can be made the
    owner of his data blocks. At any stage, no stakeholders who intend to make any
    unauthorized changes to patient information are allowed by the underlying blockchain
    due to immutability features. Some common benefits of blockchain technology as

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditionally, the healthcare industry commonly practiced to serve more patients
    and earn on volumes. This model is popularly close to the service-centric care
    in industry. The practitioners’ remuneration model is calculated as per service
    rendered. Incentives for the employees of healthcare institutions were also proportional
    to the number of patients or the quantity of care sessions. In the present scenario
    of e-healthcare, which is service based, some issues like interoperability and
    patient’s control over their own personal information [[24](#CR24)] are still
    not considered. The value-based care model allows for these provisions and is
    discussed below.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new e-healthcare model brings in a paradigm shift, it being a value-based
    care model rather than service based. The focus of e-healthcare is client-centered,
    that is, value-based care for patients. In a value-based care model, the patient
    is involved in decision-making, sometimes indirectly through IoT for example,
    where the patient may directly send the vital statistics using wearables, generating
    continuous medical history records, on the basis of which experts make decisions
    and provide requisite treatment accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very likely that in this scenario, the patient might visit different consultants
    or different healthcare centers for the health issues, thereby generating across
    different locations or databases. To avoid patient’s related information being
    fragmented across multiple database locations, all related patient data should
    be centralized, and available with the patient on-demand in a single click. The
    patient should have online instant access to his medical records to ensure access
    without communication delays while avoiding communication errors. With this model,
    continued care even by any other medical practitioner besides the regular family
    doctor can be provided to a patient based on his collective medical history.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a fully functional deployment of this model, a patient can get every information
    related to their treatment including the lab and diagnostic reports immediately
    at the same time while they are made available to the doctor. In addition, the
    patient should have full access control on when to share medical records and to
    whom, and even which part of their medical data should be given access. This complete
    model is envisioned to be scalable for more users, that is, if a new doctor is
    supposed to join the treatment panel, then he can be given access to the patient’s
    data.

    cases. Consider the case of a local caregiver working in association with an expert
    consultant available remotely toward the treatment of a patient. There has to
    be a lot of document and medical record sharing back and forth between the two.
    This sharing obviously should be secure as well as scalable. A case in point may
    be a team of experts from various locations participating collaboratively in a
    critical patient’s treatment, say some oncologists hypothetically from different
    states or some foreign expert sharing data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another use case advocating interoperability and fast interchange of information
    can be put across with a patient admitted to the emergency room of the nearest
    hospital for urgent treatment with a severe to worsening condition. The hospital,
    in this case, is not the regular treatment center but an intermediate stopover
    for stabilizing the patient. In such cases, even primary care to a patient can
    be provided only if his/her treatment and prescription history can be urgently
    made available to the treating doctor [[25](#CR25)]. The procurement and sharing
    of medical records become absolutely difficult and time critical here, especially
    if only a hard copy of the records is available at the patient’s home. The challenge
    becomes compounded if medical history data of the patient is scattered across
    his home and at the treating hospital. It is a complete breakdown of the medical
    systems in the absence of medical history records despite the presence of doctors
    and possibility of treatment and the patient. Medical record location-based fragmentation
    and the lack of interoperability together form the biggest bottleneck in the adaptation
    of IoT-based e-healthcare universally.

    classification for the implementation of storage is based on how much data is
    to be stored in a block. Depending upon the implementation, data on a blockchain
    may be stored “on-chain” or “off-chain.” The distinguishing feature is that in
    on-chain storage, all data gets stored in blocks on chain one after the other.
    Every new transaction will add a new block with updated data on the chain. This
    type of storage is useful only when data is limited, but faces huge challenges
    with increase in record sizes. It becomes a very expensive option for storage.
    The costs rise exponentially even when the network gets overloaded.

    mode functionality leading to trust establishment can become a key driving force
    for e-healthcare [[33](#CR33)]. We propose a basic framework for the IoT-based
    e-healthcare system using blockchain as per Fig. [5](#Fig5) to summarize the chapter.![](../images/513458_1_En_4_Chapter/513458_1_En_4_Fig5_HTML.png)

    e-healthcare system, data from wearable sensors and IoT-based devices along with
    prescriptions, insurance policy data, and laboratory reports as shown in the data
    generation module is depicted in part 1 of Fig. [5](#Fig5).

    in part 2 of the image. This module is responsible for removing privacy information
    from the documents before registering the same for blockchain-based storage. A
    secure one-way hash is applied to obfuscate the privacy data, and then metadata
    is generated. The data-intensive medical records are sent to be stored as blobs
    on an appropriate secure medium under the patient’s key using an identity and
    access management module (IAM) as shown.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The metadata information is used for maintaining the blockchain information
    base. All collected metadata is sent to a blockchain network as a single transaction
    on a single block after seeking due consensus from the stakeholders as per the
    consortium participants as shown in part 3 of Fig. [5](#Fig5). This process can
    be repeated after regular intervals of time in case of critical patients, where
    one new block is added for every transaction. It is noteworthy here that blockchain
    works only in append mode, and any stakeholder cannot modify the details contained
    in any block added post consensus. We have considered the ownership and access
    management of the block with the patient; however, the owner of the chain can
    be patients, doctors, any department, or even the medical organization as well,
    depending on the use case and implementation.

- en: This chain remains distributed among related stakeholders at all times and there
    is a completely controlled access of the records, based on IAM as shown in part
    4 of Fig. [5](#Fig5). Medical centers are usually permitted the highest access
    clearance because they need the complete data of the patient, doctor, emergency
    services, and data for TPA and insurance. Every e-healthcare system has some regulatory
    body that can also have full access rights, maintainable across blockchain but
    without modification rights. Access to medical record blobs is permitted only
    through API access to the blockchain, and even that happens after the execution
    of designated smart contracts requested by application services.

    clarity, but a practical implementation shall have far more complexity [[34](#CR34)–[36](#CR36)].

- en: The establishment of trust using blockchain in the industrial use case of IoT-based
    e-healthcare shows very promising opportunities and is sure to go a long way in
    the adaptation of this essential technology. There are some pertinent issues however,
    which relate to the establishment and implementation of a blockchain consortium
    and maintenance of the infrastructure. It would be interesting to see how the
    cost-effectiveness of these solutions is brought to the tipping point, as this
    might make for an easier and early adoption of the technology. The role of some
    governmental agencies as the certifying authority for e-healthcare documents shall
    also be an interesting development to track in the future. The debate for on-chain
    versus off-chain storage solutions in the case of medical records also needs to
    be settled, and the ownership of data and adherence of record maintenance to statutory
    data privacy compliance laws like HIPAA is another potential area for researchers.

- en: Another potential area for research is the development of application-based
    consensus mechanisms. For example, new consensus mechanisms are needed for healthcare-based
    blockchain applications. The traditional consensus mechanisms based on anonymity
    and high cost of computing resources are contrary to the requirements of quick
    response and user verification.
