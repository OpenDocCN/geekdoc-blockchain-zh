    is an art form that is full of variety and potential. With any number of stitches,
    one can create blankets, baskets, clothes and jewelry. Many crafters report that
    crochet is faster than knitting, and this appeals to many who might be considering
    picking up the hook for the first time. Crochet has long been considered easier
    to learn than knitting since, at its most basic, it only requires one hook and
    a ball of yarn. Crochet is a hobby that doesn’t discriminate. Anyone can do it.
    Men, women, young people, and older folks have all adopted crochet as a hobby.
    You don’t need a lot of money to crochet, either. All you need is a hook and yarn,
    as many wonderful items have been made with a simple aluminum hook and sturdy
    acrylic yarn.Crochet, as  we  know  it  at  least, developed  during  the  16th
    century. Historical  sources claim that crochet may be found in Italy as far back
    as the 1500’s, but because fiber-based archaeological  finds  do  not  survive  the  ravages  of  time  very  well,
    it  is  difficult  to  find evidence of crochet in  Europe before 1800.One  place
     that  crochet  made  a real  difference  was  in Ireland  during  the  Great
     Potato Famine.  Once  Queen  Victoria bought  crocheted  Irish lace  from women
     in Ireland, everyone who was anyone had to have it too. Irish lace took off and
    the art of crochet saved many families in Ireland from further poverty and likely
    death by starvation. Schools were formed,  teachers  trained  and  scattered  throughout
     the  island,  and  crafters  began designing  their  own  patterns.  As  personal  finances  improved,  people  began  to  emigrate
    to  America  (Marks,  2019).  Neighbors  began  to  share  patterns  and  it  wasn’t  long  before
    crochet took off in North America. Necessity is the mother of invention and it
    wasn’t long before crochet made  a  mark in clothing, housewares  and jewelry.But
    what’s with that hook? You might be surprised to know the humble crochet hook
    has been  made  of  a  wide  range  of  materials.  Aluminum  is  the  most  common  material,  the
    most  sturdy,  and  the  most  cost  effective  for  beginners.  Historically  the  hook  was  made
    out  of  whatever  crafters  had  on  hand  such  as  fossilized  mammoth  bone,  porcupine  quill,
    celluloid,  agate,  ivory  and  bone.  Very  small  hooks  that  measured  2mm  or  less  were,  and
    still are, made from steel. These days, handles can be covered with soft foam
    for increased comfort  of  crafters  with joint  pain. Handles  have  also  been
    ornately  carved,  adding  a unique and personal touch to a crafter’s tool.The
    crochet hook is a simple tool made up of a few important sections. We refer to
    the entire tool and the tip of it with the same word, “hook.” The pointed tip
    is used to poke into stitches, or into the center of circles. This is the leading
    edge of your tool. It is the hook that captures the yarn. The yarn then sits in
    the throat, or the depression right behind the hook. The body of the crochet hook
    is made up of the shaft, the thumb rest,and the handle. To make things even more
    interesting, there are two kinds of crochet hooks: in-line and tapered. An in-line
    hook has a throat that is flatter and deeper than a tapered hook. If you find
    one kind too difficult to work with, try the other. There’s no point in using
    a tool you don’t like!Hooks range from tiny to quite large! Hook size refers to
    the size of the head and the throat. Generally, crochet hooks are all the same
    length. The size of a hook is measured in millimeters, and directly impacts the
    size of your stitches and the size of whatever you are trying to make. While you
    are still getting used to the feel of the hook, it’s recommended that you start
    out with a mid-sized hook, rather than one that is very small or too large and
    cumbersome. The best yarn to start with is a worsted weight acrylic yarn thick
    enough to be easy to work with and durable in the washing machine and dryer. This
    will stand up very well to the friction produced by pulling back stitches if the
    need arises. And as anyone who has ever picked up a crochet hook can tell you—occasionally
    pulling back stitches is a fact of (crochet) life! If you study the label on the
    yarn you have in mind (or the details of the yarn if you’re shopping online),
    you’ll find a recommended hook size that corresponds to that yarn.How To Crochet
    ClothesMany crafters decide they’d like to create their own clothes, but they
    want more choices than were available back in the days of the granny square vest.
    While those vests can be quite attractive, there’s nothing wrong with variety.
    It can be great fun to decide what to make, once you know who you want to make
    the garment for! Are you crocheting for an adult or a child? Or perhaps a pet?
    If you’re crocheting for an adult, will your garment be for a man or a woman?
    We’ll discuss some of the many options available, discuss stitches that might
    lend themselves more readily to a garment and a few other considerations you may
    want to think about before starting.Crochet For BeginnersAs with all other crafts,
    you’ll want to learn the basics first and build your skills up from there. Most
    of the challenge of learning this wonderful craft will be in building your muscle
    memory. Holding the hook, manipulating the yarn, and learning how your item should
    look will all become easier with time. You need to practice these new skills as
    youlearn them. Once you master one stitch, then the next, making one charming
    item after another, you’ll build your skillset and your confidence. You’ve got
    this!![A picture containing thread  Description automatically generated](image_rsrc2Z9.jpg)There
    are many hooks available on the market today, made from a wide range of materials.
    Bamboo, aluminum, nickel and plastic are among the most sought-after. Some even
    have foam grips designed to help crafters with arthritis grip the hook more comfortably.
    It really comes down to trial and error, but you want to choose a hook that will
    allow the yarn to glide smoothly over the hook and shaft and not make you work
    harder than you have to. For this reason, many beginners start with an aluminum
    hook. Thankfully, hooks are relatively inexpensive, so one doesn’t need to break
    the bank to find a hook they like. Hooks are measured around the shaft, using
    millimeters. The millimeter measurement is then used to denote the hook''s size—for
    example, a 4mm hook measures 4mm around the shaft. The number of millimeters also
    corresponds to a letter. For example, a 4mm is also a G/6.Yarn is another material
    swimming with choices. There are so many to choose from that it can be overwhelming!
    Acrylic is a common choice, as is wool. Yarn is also made from alpaca, buffalo,
    bamboo, cotton, wool blends, Angora, and silk. You’ll want to start with a yarn
    that feels good in your hands. The more pleasant a yarn feels as it slides between
    your fingers, the more pleasure you’ll get as you learn. This is another material
    that you may want to experiment with to really get a good idea of your preferences.
    Yarn comes indifferent  thicknesses,  commonly  referred  to  as  “weights.”  Generally  speaking,  the  higher
    the number assigned to a weight, the thicker it is. So a size 3 yarn would be
    a good weight to create baby items. A fine size 1 yarn would be ideal to make
    intricate wraps and shawls.Basic StitchesAll directions in this book are written
    using US crochet terminology.Chain (ch)All chains start with a slipknot. Holding
    the yarn that leads to the ball in your left hand and your hook in your right,
    maneuver your hook under the yarn so that the yarn comes over the hook from back
    to front. Twist the hook so it captures the yarn and pull through the loop. You
    should have one loop on the hook. Repeat. After you’ve done a few of these, what
    you’ve created begins to resemble a chain: Hence the name of the stitch.Foundation
    Row (FR)A series of chain stitches into which all successive stitches are worked.Slip
    Stitch (ss)Start with one loop of yarn on the shaft of your hook. Push the tip
    of your hook under the “arms” of a previously worked stitch and swing the hook
    under the yarn. Twist to catch the yarn, and pull back toward you. There are two
    loops of yarn on your hook. Pull the left loop through the right, and you’ll have
    one loop on your hook!Single Crochet (sc)Start with one loop of yarn on your hook.
    Insert the tip of your hook into a previously worked stitch and swing the hook
    under the yarn. Capture the yarn and pull the hook toward you. There are two loops
    on the shaft of your hook. Catch the yarn again and pull through both loops on
    the shaft, leaving one loop on your hook.Double Crochet (dc)Start with a single
    loop on the shaft of your hook while holding the piece in your other hand. Position
    the hook so it passes under the yarn, capture the yarn, and twist so the yarn
    is wrapped around the shaft of the hook. You now have two loops of yarn on the
    shaft of  the  hook.  Then  push  the  hook  into  the  middle  of  a  previously  worked  stitch,  capturethe
    yarn with your hook, and pull it back through the stitch. You should now have
    three loops on your hook. Capture the yarn with your hook and pull it through
    the first two loops. You now have two loops on your hook. Capture the yarn again
    and pull through both loops. You now have one loop on your hook and you’ve made
    a double crochet stitch.Whip stitch (for sewing up)Hold your two layers of fabric
    (in this case, crocheted pieces) with the two public sides, or “right sides” together.
    Thread a darning needle with yarn and push the needle through both pieces, from
    front to back. Bring your needle to the front and once again, push it from front
    to back. This is one whip stitch. Move your needle slightly to the right and repeat
    the steps. Do this for the length of the two pieces of fabric. The smaller and
    neater these stitches are, the less noticeable they’ll be.Chapter 1: How To Crochet
    VisuallyThere are a few different ways to learn a new craft, and one thing you
    need to keep in mind is that we do not all learn the same way. Some of us can
    read instructions, grasp the intended lesson and carry out the instructions we’ve
    just read. Others among us need to sit with a person who carries out the instructions
    and shows us by example, sometimes repeatedly. We learn best with visual and auditory
    components when we’re trying to learn something new. We’re the ones who would
    be best served by a real teacher. Once upon a time, everyone’s grandmother or
    mother knew how to knit or crochet. It was easy to find someone to teach a new
    crafter. These days, that’s not the case.So how do we find someone to teach us
    how to crochet if there’s no one in our family that can pass on the knowledge?
    Many libraries hold fiber craft evenings, and a call to your local librarian would
    quickly tell you if that was an option for you. If not, place a call to a nearby
    senior center. You might be able to find someone who would gladly share their
    crochet skills in exchange for a little company and conversation. You might just
    make a new friend this way, too! If that scenario isn’t an option for you, visit
    a local yarn shop, referred to in crafting circles as LYS. Some shops have a bulletin
    board with names and telephone numbers of folks willing to teach newbies what
    they know. Many yarn shops offer lessons in either group or private settings.
    Again, a simple phone call will provide you with the information you seek. Sometimes,
    community colleges offer continuing education classes in a wide variety of hobbies.
    Your local college will have both a course guide and someone that could answer
    your questions. Another option would be an advertisement in your local newspaper
    or a job board. Is there a crochet guild in your town or city? They may have members
    that could teach you to crochet, or put you in contact with someone who could.Online
    OptionsPerhaps none of the options above appeal to you, or you don’t have easy
    geographic access to crocheters in your community. Not to worry, you still have
    options! If you have a phone that can access the internet, or if you have a computer
    or can borrow a friend’s, there are still ways to learn how to crochet. A simple
    query of your favorite search engine can reveal crochet websites, craft instruction
    blogs, or crochet guilds that have an online presence. Often designers will post
    tutorials in an effort to attract new fans. A simple online search might  just  demonstrate  you  have  more  choices  than  you  had  initially  believed!  You  willfind
    more than one video sharing website, and on those, thousands of tutorial videos
    that can propel you along the path of being a proficient crocheter.Chapter 2:
    How To Crochet HatsYou’ll want to decide early on who you’ll be crafting for.
    Sizing is more important with crochet than with knitting since the fabric you’ll
    create has less stretch. We’ll assume you’re able to measure the head you intend
    to crochet for. You’ll want to measure both circumference (the total measurement
    around the head, at temple height) and the height (from the ear to the top of
    the head, or crown). The measuring tape should be snug, but neither too tight
    or too loose. There are averages, and we’ll list these below. Be aware, however,
    that one size does not fit all!Baby (6 months +): circumference =  16” height
    = 6”Child & youth: circumference =  18”-20”  height = 7.25” - 7.50” Adult (small):
    circumference = 21”-22”  height = 8” - 8.50” Adult (large): circumference = 24”+
     height  = 9.25”You want a hat to be snug, not so loose that it falls off or so
    tight that it pops off the wearer’s head. This snugness is called “negative ease”
    and it’s important to the fit of garments—from hats to socks to sweaters.One significant
    element to the fit of the hat is your yarn. You’ll want to choose a yarn that
    has some elasticity, so cotton alone is not a great choice for this. There are
    a number of acrylic yarns on the market that are sturdy, soft and have enough
    elasticity to be a good choice for a hat. As an added bonus, you can simply throw
    the hat in the washer and dryer if it gets dirty! The best choice is a yarn that’s
    a little thicker, a worsted weight yarn for example, and a lighter color. You
    don’t want to start off with a dark yarn that you might find difficult to see.
    Save the darker shades for after you’re a little more experienced.We’re going
    to presume that you’ve chosen to use an aluminum hook for ease of use. For a hat
    crafted from a worsted weight yarn, you’ll usually want to use a size H-8 hook.
    There are two ways to hold a hook, and either way can feel foreign at first. Your
    hands will need to build “muscle memory,” so be patient with yourself. It might
    take some time to feel comfortable holding the hook, but try both holds and see
    which feels better for you.The first hold is called a “knife hold” because you
    hold the hook as you would a steak knife.The second option is called a “pencil
    hold” because the hook is held like a pencil when writing.Okay,  ready  to  move  on?  You’ll  be  creating  a  “preemie”  sized  hat  with  an  approximate
    circumference  of  10”  and  an  approximate  4”  height.  Size,  as  long  as  it’s  not  too  large,  isnot
    as important for preemies, because they will grow into—and if all goes well, quicklyout
    of—the hat!All crochet work starts with a slipknot, and the same is true here.
    Start with a slipknot and pull the tail of the yarn slightly to tighten it, but
    not so much that it can’t move on the shaft of the hook.FR - Your first row of
    stitches is called the foundation row. In this example, which produces a preemie-sized
    hat, your foundation row will be four stitches. Holding the tail end of your slipknot,
    wrap the yarn that leads to your ball around the throat of the hook, from back
    to front. Then pull the hook toward you through the loop of the slipknot. You’ve
    done your first stitch! Now repeat that stitch four more times. It will look and
    feel awkward at first, but the beauty of crochet is that even if you somehow unravel
    your stitches, it’s easy to re-create them. As we’ve said before, practice, practice,
    practice.Tip - you don’t want to pull your stitches too tightly in crochet, as
    this makes maneuvering the hook through your stitches more work than it needs
    to be.Now, make a slip stitch to join the two ends of the row together. You should
    have a loose circle of stitches, with one loop on the hook.R1:  Chain  3  (ch  3).  Next,  we’ll  make  a  double  crochet  stitch.  Loop  the  yarn  over  the  end
    of  your  hook,  go  through  the  circle,  capture  the  yarn  and  pull  it  back  through  the  ring.
    Capture the  yarn  again  and  pull  through  two  loops  on  your  hook.  Capture
    the  yarn  again and pull through all of the loops on your hook. Complete ten
    more double crochet stitches, putting  3  dc  in  each  stitch from the foundation  row.  Your  first  round  will  consist  of  12  dc
    stitches,  including  the  chain  of  3  stitches  that  began  the  row  (which  counts  as  your  first
    dc stitch). End the round by making one slip  stitch (sl st) to join the first
    and last stitches of the round. This is the end of your first round.As you work,
    you’ll need to be aware of the number of stitches you have so that you can shape
    your hat correctly. This is most easily done by marking the beginning of your
    row with a marker. A bobby pin or stitch marker does the job well, or even a piece
    of yarn in a contrasting color tied into the first stitch of the second row.Now
    you’re ready for the second round.R2: Chain 3, then do 2 double crochet (dc) in
    each stitch of the circle. When you come all the way around, do a slip stitch
    (sl st) to the first dc to join it all together. Remember your chain  3 counts
    as  your first dc of the round. You should have 24 stitches.R3:  Chain  3  again,  then  do  2  double  crochet  into  the  next  stitch,  then  1  dc  in  the  stitch
    after that. Repeat this process all the way around your circle, alternating between
    putting 2  dc  and  1  dc  in  each  stitch  until  you’re  back  at  the  beginning.  Slip  stitch  (sl  st)  to  yourfirst
    dc to join. The changeup in dc stitches provides the shaping. Now you’ll have
    36 stitches.R4: This one’s a  little different, so pay  attention. Chain 3 as
    you did  in  earlier  rounds,  do 2 dc into the next st and then 1 dc in  each
    of the next 8 stitches.Repeat  the  pattern  of  2  dc  into  one  stitch  followed  by  1  dc  into  the  next  8  stitches  four
    times. You will now have 40 stitches. Sl st to your first dc to join.R5-11:  This  round  is  a  bit  simpler.  Ch  3,  then  do  1  dc  in  each  stitch,  all  the  way  around.
    As with all your other rounds, sl st to the first dc to join. You should still
    have 40 stitches.R12:  Work  one  entire  round  of  double  crochet,  end  with  a  slip  stitch  and  weave  in  your
    ends securely.You’re done!Chapter 3: How To Crochet A Baby SweaterThere is a great
    deal of choice when it comes to baby sweaters, but the main things to keep in
    mind are comfort and fit. One will directly influence the other, of course. If
    the sweater doesn’t fit the child, they won’t be comfortable. An uncomfortable
    baby will let you know by fussiness or crying, and you don’t want that! If you’re
    going to make baby clothes with crochet, there are some measurements you need
    to know. Keep in mind, however, that these are only averages. Babies vary in size!If
    in doubt, it’s a good rule of thumb to make the garment a little bigger. Babies
    will always grow, so a little more room is a good thing.In handcrafted garments,
    whether made by knitting or crochet, one factor that plays into how  your  garment  will  fit  is  called  “ease.” 
    A  garment  that  has  “negative  ease,”  such  as socks,  will  have  a  smaller  dimension  than  the  body  part  wearing  it.  If  we  stick  with  our
    sock  example,  this  means  that  the  sock  is  slightly  smaller  than  the  foot  it’s  intended  for.
    This  is  what  keeps  handmade  socks  from  sliding  down  off  the  foot.  In  contrast,  “positive
    ease”  is  larger than the  body  part  wearing  it. Going  back  to  our baby
     sweater—2”  of positive  ease  will  give  the  baby  room to  wriggle  and  move  in  the  sweater.  You  don’t  want
    a sweater for a baby to  have negative  ease!The following pattern is for a sweater
    that will fit most newborn babies. The sweater should have two inches of positive
    ease, giving lots of room for the baby to be comfortable.Abbreviations used in
    this pattern:●     ch = chain● ch # = chain # stitches, # is the specified number
    of stitches●     rep = repeat●     sc = single crochet●     sl st= slip stitch●     sp
    = space●     st(s) = stitch(es)Materials:335 yards of worsted weight yarn of your
    choice. Check the yardage measurement on the ball of yarn to make sure you are
    purchasing enough; you may need to purchase two or even three balls, if they are
    sold in shorter yardage amounts. Whichever yarn you choose, the baby’s parent(s)
    will likely be grateful if the garment can be thrown in the washer and dryer.I-  9/5.5

    You should still have 13 sts. Turn work.Repeat the previous row until the piece
    measures 8” long. Fasten off and set aside.You’re getting there! Now make the
    other front, following the same instructions. You’ve got this!Sleeves -  Make
    2 of  these as well!FR: Chain  22 stitches.Next: 1 single  crochet  in 2nd chain
    from hook, sc  in  each  chain st to  the  end.  You should have 20 stitches.
    Turn your work.Next: Chain 1,  sc in each st to end. There should be 20 stitches.
    Turn the work.Repeat the previous row until the piece measures 6-¾” high. Fasten
    off and set aside.Assembly:To put all your pieces together, you’ll sew the front
    and back shoulder seams together first. Then the upper arms get sewn to the shoulder
    seams. Here’s how we’ll do that.The front and back pieces were made from the bottom
    up, so the chain edge is your bottom of all pieces. Lay the back and one of the
    front pieces together, “right” sides together. (The beauty of single crochet is
    that it has no “right” or “wrong” side, so it doesn’t matter which face  you  show  to  the
     world!)  Thread  your  tapestry  needle  with  about  10”  of  yarn  and beginning
    at the sleeve end of one shoulder, whip stitch across to about an inch away from
    the neck opening. Repeat on the other side of  the back with the other front piece.Now
    we’ll sew the sleeves on.Your chain edge on the sleeves is the cuff hem, and where
    you fastened off is the shoulder. Fold the sleeve in half. The side that is currently
    facing out will eventually become the inside of the sleeve. Now take the sleeve
    and center the fold at the top of the sleeve on one side of the garment. Half
    of the sleeve top will be sewn to the back and half to the front. Pin these pieces
    together with the coilless safety pins (or locking stitch markers) that I mentioned
    in the materials list.Now thread your tapestry needle  with about 15” of yarn.
    Whip  stitch the top of the sleeve to the body pieces. Repeat on the other side
    of  the sweater with the other sleeve.Next  we’ll  sew  up  the  sides.  All  your  pieces  should  be  “inside  out,”  or  “wrong  side  out.”
    Thread your needle once more with approximately 20” of yarn and whip stitch the
    side of the sweater (the back and one front piece) from hem to armpit, then  continue
    sewing the two sleeve edges together from armpit to wrist.Tip - If you find 20”
    of yarn too much, not to worry! Use half that length. But if you choose this route,
    sew from the armpit to the hem, then down the sleeve from underarm to cuff.Now
    repeat on the other side, and turn the sweater right side out.To keep the collar
    flat, fold the collar edges down from the corner and sew in place.Now space your
    buttons evenly along the edge of one of your front pieces. If this sweater is
    intended for a boy, the buttons should be on the right front piece. If the sweater
    is for a girl, the buttons will go on the left front piece. You won’t need a button
    band for buttonholes. The buttons should slide through the stitches on the opposite
    piece.You did it! Well done!Chapter 4: How To Crochet JewelryIt’s no surprise
    that crochet can be found in jewelry as well. Crafters of all ages and skill levels
    can produce wearable art. Below are a couple of examples.Friendship BraceletThis  bracelet  is  easy  to  make,  versatile  and  can  be  made  in  a  variety  of  colors.  It’s  made
    with  crochet  thread,  which  is  a  specially  formulated  thread  used  for  crochet.  You’ll  need
    a  length  of  crochet  thread  and  a  B-1/2.25 mm  crochet  hook.  Depending  on  the  recipient,
    you shouldn’t need more than 9-10” of thread. The average 8 year old girl’s wrist
    is about 6,” while an adult woman’s wrist can be up to 8” in circumference. You
    could measure the recipient’s wrist to be certain of how much crochet thread  you’ll
    need.R1:  Leaving  a  long  tail,  chain  3,  work  1  sc  into  the  2nd  chain,  then  again  in  the  next  2
    chains. Chain 1. Turn the work.R2: Work  1  sc  in  each  of  the  stitches.  Chain  1,  then
    turn  your  work. You  should  still  have 3 stitches.R3: Work 1 sc in each  of
    the 3 sts, chain  1, turn work.R4: Repeat R3 until your bracelet measures the
    length you want. Fasten off, leaving another long tail. Now you can use your long
    ends to fasten your bracelet around your friend’s wrist!Crochet Flower & ChainFor
    this project, you’ll need:●     US G-6/4mm crochet hook● a heavy bead or button
    for the center of your flower● approximately 6-10 yards of any sport weight yarn
    you like bestChain 82. Now chain 8 more for your flower. Put a stitch marker here
    to easily find where the stitches for the flower start.Turn your work and put
    a slip stitch into the 8th chain from the hook. Chain 3, turn the work and slip
    stitch into the center of that ch 8 ring you just made. Repeat 4 times. This will
    create five small flower petal bases around the edge of the center circle.Chain
    3, turn your work, and put 3 dc stitches into the space made by one of the ch-3
    from the previous step. Chain 3 more, and sl st to the same space where you worked
    the dc. Now you have your first full flower petal.Now repeat the pattern to [ch
    1, sl st to next chain 3 sp, ch 3, 3 dc in same ch-3 sp, ch 3, sl st to same ch-3
    sp] 4 times. This will create the other petals for your flower.Chain  82  for  the  other  side  of  the  necklace.  Now  fasten  the  heavy  bead  or  button  in  the
    center of the flower.Voila! You’ve made a necklace!ConclusionCrochet is a hobby
    that is fun, accessible, and full of potential. It can be done by anyone who can
    hold a hook and yarn, of almost any age, of any income, and certainly of any gender.
    There’s never a fear of plateau or boredom either, as there’s always something
    more to learn, or a new pattern to try, or a new yarn that might be perfect to
    bring your project to life.But crochet can bring more to your life than simply
    an answer to boredom. It has also been shown to be good for your mental health
    and improve memory and concentration. As you craft each stitch, you need to be
    aware of where your hook is going, how the yarn is behaving, and how the overall
    project is coming together. Mindfulness at its best!The repetitiveness of the
    actions has its own benefits as well, once the muscle memory has been developed.
    It’s this predictability that helps to lower your blood pressure and provide a
    sense of calm. When we’re stressed, our bodies produce an excess of cortisol which
    can be disastrous to our circulatory system. So it’s in our best interests to
    regulate it as much as possible. Crochet can help do that.Once you’re comfortable
    with the basic stitches used to complete the projects in this guide, you can go
    on to learn the treble stitch, the half double crochet, the shell stitches, or
    perhaps even make a blanket with the garnet stitch.Hopefully you can see the potential
    of crochet as a pastime and a link to the past. You can clothe your loved ones,
    keep them warm, and make some pretty nifty jewelry as well. From the foundation
    stitches, you can build your crochet skills and move onto making socks, mittens,
    blankets, adult sweaters, and so much more! There are a number of items that can
    benefit your pets too. Did you know that you could crochet a chicken sweater?
    It’s true! It’s not just dogs and cats that can be well-dressed. Many crafters
    are also turning their skills to making baskets and beds for animals in shelters
    as well. The world of crochet is full of potential!May your hook never snag and
    your yarn never tangle.Your FREE GiftYou can grab Your copy by clicking on the
