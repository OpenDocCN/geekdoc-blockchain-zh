    the MQTT protocol. Like a human mind, it grows over time. Its self-learning systems
    use data mining, pattern recognition, and natural language processing to mimic
    the way your brain works. Watson processes at a rate of 80 teraflops per second
    (one teraflop is a trillion floating-point operations). To put this into context,
    that replicates — and in some cases surpasses — a high-functioning human’s ability
    to answer questions. Watson is able to do this by accessing 90 servers with a
    combined data store of more than 200 million pages of information, which it processes
    against six million logic rules. Watson is about the size of ten refrigerators,
    but it’s been getting smaller and faster.
