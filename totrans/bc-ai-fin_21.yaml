- en: Hopefully by the time of you have finished reading this text and book you feel
    a little more confident and comfortable about both the emerging technologies themselves
    as well as the applications and implementation issues that may arise along the
    way. No single book or manuscript is ever going to be able to cover or effectively
    address the full scope of how technology or other changes will be changing the
    profession going forward. The buzzwords of the day do seem to focus on technology
    and technology applications, including blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotic
    process automation, and other automation software packages, but that does not
    mean that these will always be the force driving disruption and change in the
    financial services landscape. As mentioned previously, if the clock was dialed
    back to the early or even mid-1990s the terms that are driving change and innovation
    throughout the business landscape would be more related to the internet or cellular
    technology.

  zh: 希望在您读完本文和本书时，您对新兴技术以及可能在发展过程中出现的应用和实施问题感到更加自信和舒适。任何一本书籍或手稿永远无法覆盖或有效解决技术或其他变化将如何改变专业的全部范围。当今的热词似乎集中在技术和技术应用上，包括区块链、人工智能、机器人流程自动化和其他自动化软件包，但这并不意味着这些将永远是驱动金融服务行业颠覆和变革的力量。如先前提到的，如果时光能够倒流到90年代初甚至中期，推动商业格局变革和创新的术语可能更多与互联网或蜂窝技术相关。
- en: Regardless of the specific technology or tool, however, some of the underlying
    facts and patterns that are connected to the financial services landscape will
    remain undeterred. Automation, pressure of fees and compensation packages, increased
    competition, and the global development of finance itself are powerful external
    forces that do not appear to be decreasing in intensity of frequency. While practitioners
    will not have to become technical experts, programmers, or other technical experts
    associated with the details or minutia of different technical tools, practitioners
    will have to understand how these tools functions. Understanding the applications
    and implications of technology represent, simultaneously, an opportunity and a
    challenge for practitioners and firms to embrace, contend with, and utilize as
    the landscape changes quickly.

  zh: 然而，无论具体的技术或工具如何，一些与金融服务行业相关的基本事实和模式将保持不变。自动化、费用和补偿方案的压力、增加的竞争以及全球金融的发展都是强大的外部力量，似乎在强度或频率上并未减弱。尽管从业人员不必成为技术专家、程序员或与不同技术工具的细节或琐事相关的其他技术专家，但他们必须了解这些工具的功能。理解技术的应用和影响同时代表了从业者和公司迅速适应、应对和利用变化的机遇和挑战。
- en: Additionally, the influx of technology and technology integration into the numerous
    aspects of the financial services profession will also generate opportunities
    for those willing to take calculated risks. Risk, by its very nature, is both
    part of how businesses operate as well as trend and force that can make even seasoned
    individuals feel uncomfortable or anxious. That said, making best use of technology
    tools and processes remains the responsibility and task that financial professionals
    need to understand. Automation and technology remain forces and trends that will
    undeniably come to the professional landscape, but that does not mean that the
    profession will be made obsolete and or sidelined in the face of a changing business
    landscape. Taking all of these different forces into account, there are a few
    core directions that the financial services profession is moving toward.

  zh: 此外，技术和技术整合进入金融服务专业各个方面也会为那些愿意冒险的人带来机会。 风险的本质决定了它既是企业运作的一部分，也是一种趋势和力量，可以使即使是经验丰富的人感到不舒适或焦虑。
    也就是说，充分利用技术工具和流程仍然是金融从业者需要理解的责任和任务。 自动化和技术仍然是无可否认的专业领域的趋势和力量，但这并不意味着在商业环境变化的面前，该行业将变得过时或被边缘化。考虑到所有这些不同的力量，金融服务专业的发展方向有一些核心方向。
- en: First, and arguably most importantly, the roles and duties associated with different
    aspects of the financial services practitioners are going to change and be almost
    unrecognizable as a result of the emerging technologies impacting the profession.
    Accounting is already feeling the effect of decentralized record keeping tools
    such as blockchain, and artificial intelligence is also playing a role in the
    market making aspects of the professional landscape. Trading algorithms leveraging
    deep learning and artificial intelligence are already playing a role and significant
    force in the volumes and total financial assets traded and exchanged. Smart contracts
    can amplify the effects of computerized trading by, in effect, removing several
    intermediaries and steps in the trading process. Currency swaps, interest rate
    swaps and trades, and the effect of foreign currency reporting and analysis on
    bottom line performance can be improved, sped up, and facilitated via the integration
    of emerging technologies.

  zh: 首先，可以说最重要的是，由于新兴技术影响该行业，与金融服务从业者的不同方面相关的角色和职责将发生变化，并且几乎不可辨认。 会计已经感受到了分散记账工具（如区块链）的影响，人工智能也在职业领域的市场制造方面发挥作用。
    利用深度学习和人工智能的交易算法已经在交易和交换的总体金融资产中发挥了作用。 智能合约可以通过实际上消除交易过程中的几个中间人和步骤来放大计算机化交易的效果。
    通过新兴技术的整合，货币互换，利率互换和交易，以及外币的报告和分析对利润表现的影响可以得到改善，加快和促进。
- en: Second, and as a direct result of the changing roles and responsibilities of
    practitioners, the reality of the ground is that some roles and positions will
    be eliminated. Lower level tasks and roles that form the basis for many practitioner
    workloads will be either augmented or eliminated altogether as a result of increased
    technological integration. With these job losses, however, will also come different
    options and opportunities for professionals motivated and proactively oriented.
    As certain tasks can be automated or streamlined, such as pieces of the audit
    or financial trading process, this will open the door to new and more sophisticated
    options. For example, if practitioners are not spending time doing manual work
    or tasks, this means that they are, at last, able to truly evolve into and become
    a strategic partner or trusted advisor. On top of being a goal cited by professionals
    for years, this is also a reality and trend that must be completed by practitioners
    in different areas of the financial services role.

  zh: 第二，作为从业者角色和责任变化的直接结果，实际情况是，一些角色和职位将被消除。 许多从业者工作负荷基础的低级任务和角色将会因 increased technological
    integration 而被扩充或完全被消除。然而，随着这些工作的流失，也会出现不同的选择和机会，对于积极进取和有动力的专业人士来说。作为某些任务可以自动化或精简，例如审计或金融交易过程的某些环节，这将开启新的更复杂的选择。例如，如果从业者不再花时间做手工作业或任务，这意味着他们最终能成为战略合作伙伴或信任的顾问。这不仅是多年来专业人士所提的目标，也是不同金融服务领域的从业者必须完成的现实和趋势。
- en: Third, the shift in mindset and perspective that is necessary for practitioners
    to succeed is one a strategic partner and advisor versus just a compliance based
    role. Although compliance and remaining in compliance with new and emerging regulations
    will undoubtedly be important moving forward that is only one component of the
    work performed by financial services professionals. Even as new regulations, including
    GDPR, MiDi, and other financial regulations become increasingly integrated into
    the workforce, professionals are going to need to play a variety of roles. In
    addition to analyzing and understanding what the regulations mean both from an
    abstract and theoretical perspective as well as how to implement these rules into
    the organization. Also, interpreting the impact of these regulations on the firm
    itself, as well as any counterparty risk generated as a result of implementation
    is also something practitioners will need to be aware of moving forward.

  zh: 第三，从业者成功所必须的思维和视角转变是成为战略伙伴和顾问，而不只是履行合规角色。尽管遵守和保持符合新出现的法规无疑是未来重要的一部分，但这只是金融服务专业人员所执行工作的一个组成部分。即使是新的法规，包括GDPR、MiDi和其他金融法规越来越多地整合到工作中，从业者将需要扮演各种角色。除了分析和理解法规的抽象和理论意义以及如何将这些规则实施到组织中之外，还需要解释这些法规对公司本身的影响，以及由于实施而产生的任何交易对手风险也是从业者将来需要意识到的事情。
- en: Last but not least is the simple reality that by the time this book makes it
    to your bookshelf, be it virtual or physical, some of these trends, directions,
    and forces may be very different. Indeed some of these forces and trends may have
    been replaced, augmented, or otherwise rendered nearly obsolete by other forces.
    That said, it does seem reasonable to forecast that, despite the machinations
    and permutations of the market or the specific technology tools that are put into
    play by organizations. Whether it is focused around robotic process automation,
    full blown artificial intelligence, or other kinds of automation software it is
    going to be important that biases and other guidelines are factored into the development
    and implementation of advanced technology tools. Coupled with these automation
    tools, which are going to accelerate the processing speed with which data is analyzed,
    processed, and reported to the marketplace the rise of blockchain augmented platforms
    is going to also impact the work and functionality associated with financial services
    professionals.

  zh: 最后但并非不重要的是，当这本书到达您的书架上，无论是虚拟的还是实体的，一些趋势、方向和力量可能已经截然不同。的确，一些这样的力量和趋势可能已经被其他力量所取代、增强或以其他方式几乎变得过时。尽管市场的策划和变化，或者组织所采用的特定技术工具可能更换了某些力量。不管是围绕机器人流程自动化，全面的人工智能，或者其他种类的自动化软件，都很重要的是偏见和其他指导方针被纳入先进技术工具的开发和实施中。除了这些自动化工具，它们将加快数据分析、处理和报告给市场的速度之外，区块链增强平台的崛起也将影响与金融服务专业人员相关的工作和功能。
- en: Moving forward, and taking into account that every organization is different,
    accounting and financial professionals are going to have to become more comfortable
    with partnering with different subsets of the professional landscape. Whether
    it means that the organization acquires or forms a joint venture with other organizations,
    expands into new areas, or develop current business lines into new areas. Whatever
    the case may ultimately end up being, the reality on the ground is that accounting
    and other financial services professionals are going to have to evolve and change
    how they operate and engage with current and future clients and customers. The
    future is permanently uncertain, and that will not change regardless of how much
    technology into factored into the conversation, but it does appear clear that
    with every challenge or obstacles that may arise there will also be opportunities
    and openings for proactive and forward looking entrepreneurs. Will there be challenges
    and stumbles as these different technology tools become increasingly integrated
    throughout business at large? Absolutely. Are there going to be job changes and
    losses as these tools displace some of the work currently performed by professionals?
    Yes. All of that said, as automation and digitization continue to come to the
    financial services community it is also readily evident that these forces are
    to be treated as allies and forces for good.
