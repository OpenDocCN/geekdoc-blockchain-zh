    a little more confident and comfortable about both the emerging technologies themselves
    as well as the applications and implementation issues that may arise along the
    way. No single book or manuscript is ever going to be able to cover or effectively
    address the full scope of how technology or other changes will be changing the
    profession going forward. The buzzwords of the day do seem to focus on technology
    and technology applications, including blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotic
    process automation, and other automation software packages, but that does not
    mean that these will always be the force driving disruption and change in the
    financial services landscape. As mentioned previously, if the clock was dialed
    back to the early or even mid-1990s the terms that are driving change and innovation
    throughout the business landscape would be more related to the internet or cellular
    technology.

    facts and patterns that are connected to the financial services landscape will
    remain undeterred. Automation, pressure of fees and compensation packages, increased
    competition, and the global development of finance itself are powerful external
    forces that do not appear to be decreasing in intensity of frequency. While practitioners
    will not have to become technical experts, programmers, or other technical experts
    associated with the details or minutia of different technical tools, practitioners
    will have to understand how these tools functions. Understanding the applications
    and implications of technology represent, simultaneously, an opportunity and a
    challenge for practitioners and firms to embrace, contend with, and utilize as
    the landscape changes quickly.

    aspects of the financial services profession will also generate opportunities
    for those willing to take calculated risks. Risk, by its very nature, is both
    part of how businesses operate as well as trend and force that can make even seasoned
    individuals feel uncomfortable or anxious. That said, making best use of technology
    tools and processes remains the responsibility and task that financial professionals
    need to understand. Automation and technology remain forces and trends that will
    undeniably come to the professional landscape, but that does not mean that the
    profession will be made obsolete and or sidelined in the face of a changing business
    landscape. Taking all of these different forces into account, there are a few
    core directions that the financial services profession is moving toward.

- en: First, and arguably most importantly, the roles and duties associated with different
    aspects of the financial services practitioners are going to change and be almost
    unrecognizable as a result of the emerging technologies impacting the profession.
    Accounting is already feeling the effect of decentralized record keeping tools
    such as blockchain, and artificial intelligence is also playing a role in the
    market making aspects of the professional landscape. Trading algorithms leveraging
    deep learning and artificial intelligence are already playing a role and significant
    force in the volumes and total financial assets traded and exchanged. Smart contracts
    can amplify the effects of computerized trading by, in effect, removing several
    intermediaries and steps in the trading process. Currency swaps, interest rate
    swaps and trades, and the effect of foreign currency reporting and analysis on
    bottom line performance can be improved, sped up, and facilitated via the integration
    of emerging technologies.

    practitioners, the reality of the ground is that some roles and positions will
    be eliminated. Lower level tasks and roles that form the basis for many practitioner
    workloads will be either augmented or eliminated altogether as a result of increased
    technological integration. With these job losses, however, will also come different
    options and opportunities for professionals motivated and proactively oriented.
    As certain tasks can be automated or streamlined, such as pieces of the audit
    or financial trading process, this will open the door to new and more sophisticated
    options. For example, if practitioners are not spending time doing manual work
    or tasks, this means that they are, at last, able to truly evolve into and become
    a strategic partner or trusted advisor. On top of being a goal cited by professionals
    for years, this is also a reality and trend that must be completed by practitioners
    in different areas of the financial services role.

- en: Third, the shift in mindset and perspective that is necessary for practitioners
    to succeed is one a strategic partner and advisor versus just a compliance based
    role. Although compliance and remaining in compliance with new and emerging regulations
    will undoubtedly be important moving forward that is only one component of the
    work performed by financial services professionals. Even as new regulations, including
    GDPR, MiDi, and other financial regulations become increasingly integrated into
    the workforce, professionals are going to need to play a variety of roles. In
    addition to analyzing and understanding what the regulations mean both from an
    abstract and theoretical perspective as well as how to implement these rules into
    the organization. Also, interpreting the impact of these regulations on the firm
    itself, as well as any counterparty risk generated as a result of implementation
    is also something practitioners will need to be aware of moving forward.

    to your bookshelf, be it virtual or physical, some of these trends, directions,
    and forces may be very different. Indeed some of these forces and trends may have
    been replaced, augmented, or otherwise rendered nearly obsolete by other forces.
    That said, it does seem reasonable to forecast that, despite the machinations
    and permutations of the market or the specific technology tools that are put into
    play by organizations. Whether it is focused around robotic process automation,
    full blown artificial intelligence, or other kinds of automation software it is
    going to be important that biases and other guidelines are factored into the development
    and implementation of advanced technology tools. Coupled with these automation
    tools, which are going to accelerate the processing speed with which data is analyzed,
    processed, and reported to the marketplace the rise of blockchain augmented platforms
    is going to also impact the work and functionality associated with financial services
    professionals.

    accounting and financial professionals are going to have to become more comfortable
    with partnering with different subsets of the professional landscape. Whether
    it means that the organization acquires or forms a joint venture with other organizations,
    expands into new areas, or develop current business lines into new areas. Whatever
    the case may ultimately end up being, the reality on the ground is that accounting
    and other financial services professionals are going to have to evolve and change
    how they operate and engage with current and future clients and customers. The
    future is permanently uncertain, and that will not change regardless of how much
    technology into factored into the conversation, but it does appear clear that
    with every challenge or obstacles that may arise there will also be opportunities
    and openings for proactive and forward looking entrepreneurs. Will there be challenges
    and stumbles as these different technology tools become increasingly integrated
    throughout business at large? Absolutely. Are there going to be job changes and
    losses as these tools displace some of the work currently performed by professionals?
    Yes. All of that said, as automation and digitization continue to come to the
    financial services community it is also readily evident that these forces are
    to be treated as allies and forces for good.
