  zh: 摘要
- en: The economic, information and material flows in construction logistics are usually
    disintegrated—but blockchain could integrate them into a shared digital ledger
    supported by smart contracts, thus creating value for the relevant actors (e.g.
    contractors, suppliers). Therefore, we explore such a solution’s potential by
    conceptualizing, developing, implementing, and testing a relevant pilot in the
    Swedish context. Theoretically, we adopt sociomateriality, thus understanding
    blockchain as a digital facilitator of transactions, flow integration, social
    interactions, and trust development. Methodologically, we review the literature
    on blockchain for construction logistics, and report from our empirical studies
    in Sweden. The literature review showed that core blockchain properties can generate
    value for construction logistics (e.g. reduction of accounting rework)—however,
    there currently exist no use cases beyond concepts and pilots. Moreover, implementation
    can be challenging due to practical and security constraints—also reflected in
    our own empirical material. Regardless, the solution was conceptualized as a permissioned
    private proof-of-authority blockchain named BlogCHAIN, and developed into an online
    application based on Hyperledger Besu. Testing BLogCHAIN revealed that the practitioners’
    resistance and powerplay required a simplification of our initial concept. Indeed,
    the flows were integrated, more decentralization and transparency were achieved,
    and previously time-consuming processes were facilitated—but the main contractor
    retained control over critical logistics segments. Our lessons-learned showed
    that several issues can jeopardize the adoption of blockchain, like existing power
    balances and unrealistic hopes of transparency and accountability beyond established
    business practices. The solution could be integrated with the IoT and machine
    learning in the future.

  zh: 建筑物流中的经济、信息和物质流通通常是分散的，但区块链可以将它们整合到由智能合同支持的共享数字账本中，从而为相关参与者（如承包商、供应商）创造价值。因此，我们通过在瑞典情境中概念化、开发、实施和测试一个相关试点来探索这种解决方案的潜力。理论上，我们采用社会物质性，从而将区块链理解为交易、流程整合、社会互动和信任发展的数字促进者。在方法上，我们审查了建筑物流领域的区块链文献，并报告了我们在瑞典的实证研究结果。文献回顾显示，核心区块链属性可以为建筑物流产生价值（如减少会计重做）—然而，当前还不存在超出概念和试点范畴的实际应用案例。此外，由于实际和安全约束，实施可能具有挑战性—这也反映在我们自己的实证材料中。然而，该解决方案被概念化为一个名为BlogCHAIN的权限私有权威证明区块链，并根据Hyperledger
    Besu开发为在线应用程序。测试BLogCHAIN表明，从业者的抵制和权力斗争要求简化我们最初的概念。确实，流程被整合，实现了更多的去中心化和透明度，并简化了先前耗时的流程—但主要承包商仍控制着关键的物流领域。我们的经验教训表明，多种问题可能危及区块链的采纳，比如现有的权力平衡和对透明度和问责能力超出已建立业务实践的不切实际期望。该解决方案未来可以与物联网和机器学习相结合。

  zh: 1 引言
- en: The integration of flows within construction supply chains and logistics has
    long been identified as crucial for the optimization of logistics and the overall
    success of construction projects [[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2)]. The information, material,
    and financial flows have been identified in [[3](#CR3)], where the criticality
    of their integration for effective construction supply chain and logistics management
    had also been noted. The information flow can be understood as the bidirectional
    flow of prompts and requirements received and released by a construction supply
    chain partner [[3](#CR3)]; the material flow as the flow of physical assets, and
    the financial flow as the exchange of pecuniary assets while encompassing things
    like the operational cost [[3](#CR3), [4](#CR4)]. Other descriptions for the latter
    flow include ‘cash flow’ (i.e. cash transactions) [[5](#CR5), [6](#CR6)], and
    ‘money flow’ (i.e. monetary affairs) [[7](#CR7)]. More recently, it was considered
    that such descriptions of the latter flow only partially account for transactions
    integrating data on prices, billing, and invoices [[8](#CR8)]. Therefore, the
    term ‘economic flow’ was introduced in [[8](#CR8)], in order to complement the
    information and material flows. The flow disintegration was also noted in [[8](#CR8)],
    given that such flows can include material and service supplies, payments, accounting,
    and other tasks that are often treated second-handedly by site management, subcontractors,
    transporters, retailers, and suppliers. The economic flow is a source of disturbances
    and delays in construction, including partial, delayed, or even absent payments,
    cost of finance, long payment cycle, retention, disputes over payments, and security
    of payments [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)].

  zh: 建筑供应链和物流的流程整合长期以来被认为对物流优化和建筑项目的整体成功至关重要[[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2)]。信息、物质和资金流在[[3](#CR3)]中得到确认，同时也指出了对于有效的建筑供应链和物流管理，它们的整合至关重要。信息流可以理解为建筑供应链合作伙伴收到和发布的提示和要求的双向流动[[3](#CR3)]；物资流为物理资产的流动，资金流则是货币资产的交流，其中包括运营成本[[3](#CR3),
    [4](#CR4)]。其它对于后者的描述还包括‘现金流’（即现金交易）[[5](#CR5), [6](#CR6)]，和‘资金流’（即货币事务）[[7](#CR7)]。最近，有人认为这些对后者的描述只部分涵盖了整合价格、账单和发票数据的交易，因此，术语‘经济流’在[[8](#CR8)]中被提出，以补充信息和物质流。[[8](#CR8)]中也提到了流动的分解，因为这些流动可能包括物资和服务供应、付款、会计和其他经常被工地管理、分包商、运输商、零售商和供应商次要对待的任务。经济流是施工中干扰和延迟的源头，包括部分的、延迟的甚至是没有的付款、融资成本、长付款周期、留存款、付款纠纷和付款安全[[9](#CR9),
    [10](#CR10)]。
- en: It has been envisioned that a way to ameliorate the disintegration of the three
    flows is by integrating them in an event-driven way; such ‘events’ can include
    the issuing of invoices and payments to the associated actors (e.g. suppliers)
    via direct peer-to-peer information exchange after the successful completion of
    other ‘events’, such as the delivery of materials, correct on-site component placement,
    and completion of related work packages [[11](#CR11)]. However, the actual benefits,
    framework, appropriate technology, and implications of such an integration, have
    been explored in only a few studies (e.g. in [[8](#CR8)]), while the evaluation
    of a relevant solution’s live testing and user experience has not been adequately
    investigated yet.

- en: 'Given the aforementioned considerations, the research question for the current
    chapter is: What would a solution for construction logistics, in which the information,
    material and economic flows are integrated in an event-driven way via a suitable
    technology, be—and what results would come out of its conceptualization, development,
    implementation and testing in a context-conscious manner? We aim to answer this
    question by following the work in [[8](#CR8), [12](#CR12)–[14](#CR14)], and exploring
    the functionality and potential value of such a solution realized through blockchain.
    We report from our research in the Swedish context, where we conceptualized, developed,
    implemented, and tested a blockchain pilot (named *BLogCHAIN*—*Building Logistics
    blockCHAIN*) for digitalized construction logistics with integrated flows. We
    adopt the theory of sociomateriality, in order to understand blockchain as a digital
    facilitator of transactions and flow integration, and relate it to social interactions
    and the development of trust. Methodologically, we systematically review the literature
    on blockchain-related research for construction logistics, and report from two
    years of empirical studies in Sweden, including the results of implementing and
    testing BLogCHAIN on a large construction site.'

- en: Sociomateriality is an approach that emphasizes the way technologies are co-shaped
    with practices (also applying to digital technologies) [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)].
    According to sociomateriality, the material and social aspects of digital technologies
    are inseparable and fused in practice [[16](#CR16)]. This is reflected in the
    agency of the actors while they are utilizing the digital technology, since actions
    are considered to cease being exclusively human properties but are rather performed
    through interactions between humans and non-humans [[17](#CR17)]. This sociomaterial
    co-shaping can affect the structure of an organization or a constellation of actors
    [[17](#CR17), [18](#CR18)].

  zh: 社会物质性是一种强调科技与实践共同塑造的方法（也适用于数字技术）[[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)]。根据社会物质性，数字技术的物质和社会方面是不可分割的，融合在实践中[[16](#CR16)]。这体现在参与者利用数字技术时的代理能力上，因为行为被认为不再仅仅是人类的属性，而是通过人与非人之间的互动来执行[[17](#CR17)]。这种社会物质性的共同塑造可以影响组织的结构或参与者的结构[[17](#CR17),
    [18](#CR18)]。
- en: Important notions in understanding sociomateriality are entanglement and performativity
    [[16](#CR16)]. Entanglement implies that a technology’s material and social aspects
    are not merely realized as being progressively intertwined (which could foster
    an understanding that they initially exist separately), but actually understood
    as not having an independent, self-contained state [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16),
    [19](#CR19)]. Performativity alludes to a world getting reshaped through ongoing
    reconfigurations [[16](#CR16), [19](#CR19)]. Τhis position, posing that a technology’s
    performativity emerges through social practices, strongly contrasts with the more
    dominant one posing a world that is made up of self-standing entities of technology
    and actors with a priori properties [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)].

    [16](#CR16), [19](#CR19)]。表现性指的是通过持续的重塑来重塑世界[[16](#CR16), [19](#CR19)]。这种立场表明，技术的表现性是通过社会实践而出现的，这与更加主导的立场形成强烈对比，后者认为世界由具有先验属性的技术和参与者的自主实体构成[[15](#CR15),
    [16](#CR16)]。

- en: Sociomaterial understandings of blockchain are relatively few, but have given
    particular insights. In detail, blockchain is intertwined with the social world
    in both its protocol and implementation levels [[20](#CR20)]. Thus, the stakeholders’
    actions and issues of governance are critical when it comes to the consensus mechanisms
    of the operation protocols (e.g. smart contracts, permission regulation, etc.),
    as well as the framing and constraints of the technology’s implementation [[20](#CR20)].
    This framing also shapes the way the actors in the blockchain constellation understand
    trust, information privacy, scalability, security, user behavior, disintermediation,
    and environmental sustainability [[20](#CR20)]. It can also lead to blockchains
    with different privacy settings [[20](#CR20)]. Furthermore, blockchain can facilitate
    a complex sociomaterial system among actors, by digitizing the value chain, integrating
    various flows, shifting routines and capabilities, and reconfiguring existing
    infrastructure [[18](#CR18)].

  zh: 区块链的社会物质理解相对较少，但提供了特定的见解。详细来说，区块链在其协议和实施级别上与社会世界交织在一起[[20](#CR20)]。因此，在涉及操作协议的共识机制（例如智能合约、权限规制等）以及技术实施的框架和限制时，利益相关者的行动和治理问题至关重要[[20](#CR20)]。这种框架也塑造了区块链体系中的参与者对信任、信息隐私、可扩展性、安全性、用户行为、无中介化和环境可持续性的理解[[20](#CR20)]。它还可能导致具有不同隐私设置的区块链[[20](#CR20)]。此外，区块链可以通过数字化价值链、整合各种流程、转变常规和能力，以及重新配置现有基础设施来促进参与者之间复杂的社会物质系统[[18](#CR18)]。
- en: Building on those sociomaterial insights, a sociomaterial definition of a blockchain
    solution for construction logistics with integrated flows was offered in [[8](#CR8)],
    as a permissioned private digital ledger for partially decentralized peer-to-peer
    information and economic transactions across a project-specific network/constellation
    of supply chain actors (e.g. clients, contractors, logistics consultants, and
    suppliers). This digital ledger is append-only, permanent, stored and accessed
    in a historical record updated through consensus, and shared across all network
    nodes reflecting the actors in the constellation [[8](#CR8)]. As a permissioned
    system, it features a reduced but existing need for in-between verification, security
    and settlement of transactions, and the consensus updates are based on proof-of-authority—where
    consensus features identity as a stake and is agreed between the authorized participants
    [[8](#CR8)]. In addition, it creates power shifts within the constellation, aligned
    with the sociomaterial autonomy-control paradox [[21](#CR21)]. The economic transactions
    are event-driven and event-inducing, i.e. they are triggered when certain events
    in the information flow (e.g. issuing purchasing orders) and/or the material flow
    (e.g. on-site material deliveries) take place, and can trigger other events (e.g.
    issuing invoices when transactions are completed); thus, the economic, material
    and information flows get integrated [[8](#CR8)].

  zh: 建立在这些社会物质见解的基础上，提出了一个关于建筑物流的区块链解决方案的社会物质化定义，其中集成了流程，并在特定项目网络/供应链参与者（例如客户、承包商、物流顾问和供应商）之间进行部分分散式点对点信息和经济交易的许可私人数字分类账[[8](#CR8)]。这个数字分类账是只追加，永久的，通过共识更新的历史记录，共享在反映星座参与者的所有网络节点上[[8](#CR8)]。作为一个许可系统，它减少了传统的交易验证，安全性和结算的需求，并且基于权威证明的共识更新，其中共识包括身份和被授权参与者之间的协议[[8](#CR8)]。此外，还实现了星座内的权力转移，与社会物质自主控制悖论保持一致[[21](#CR21)]。经济交易是事件驱动和事件诱发的，即在信息流程（例如发布采购订单）和/或物料流程（例如在现场物资交付）中发生特定事件时触发，并可以触发其他事件（例如在交易完成时发布发票）；因此，经济、物料和信息流程得到了整合[[8](#CR8)]。

    by independent logistics consultants (usually hired as third-party logistics facilitators
    by the clients), and the suppliers are interchangeable with the transporters and/or
    subcontractors (as is the case in many real projects) [[8](#CR8)]. The order placement,
    approval and renewal (economic + information flows) can be done directly through
    the blockchain system itself (e.g. with the storing of hashes of files pertaining
    to these transactions), and subsequently trigger the on-site transportation and
    delivery (economic + information + material flows). Finally, the successful on-site
    checks of the deliveries are stored as smart contracts (information + material
    flows), the issuing of invoices is event-triggered within smart contract clauses
    (economic + information + material flows), and the release of payments is predefined,
    again, through smart contracts (economic + information flows). As such, the solution
    is shown to simplify and integrate the flows, thus accelerating processes and
    countering delivery failures, imprecise data retrieval, delays, withheld payments,
    multiple ledger structures, and faulty intra-systemic data transfers [[8](#CR8)].

- en: Moreover, the setup’s transparency and traceability are enhanced through all
    the actors’ active involvement in the consensus checks of the smart contracts—even
    clients and the suppliers, who were more passive in a pre-blockchain setup [[8](#CR8)].
    By being actively involved in shaping all three flows, clients and suppliers can
    have a more detailed and transparent overview of the construction supply chain
    and logistics [[8](#CR8)]. Moreover, the independent logistics consultants actively
    help shape the flows by implementing the solution and fostering accountability
    through the consensus checks [[8](#CR8)]. However, it should also be noted that
    in line with the sociomaterial autonomy-control paradox [[21](#CR21)], the general
    contractor may lose a lot of their centralized power over the supply chain—as
    this power would be diffused, through the consensus checks and the automated processes
    of the blockchain, to the rest of the actors. On the other hand, blockchain solutions
    also risk getting too decentralized, leading to participants developing their
    own variants (‘forks’) [[22](#CR22)].

    actors (i.e. suppliers and the contractor’s operatives and site managers) willing
    to test our prospective prototype there. Seven semi-structured interviews were
    carried out in September 2020 and provided material on the supply chain and logistics
    work practices in that specific context (e.g. the existence of other IT solutions,
    and different degrees of systemic integration between the contractor and each
    supplier).

    the last round of the preliminary interviews was finished. In the second development
    iteration (in January 2021, before the second field testing iteration), evaluation
    results after the first field testing iteration were considered. As such, three
    improvements were introduced in the subsequent development: the conditional re-involvement
    of the client and the logistics consultants, the deployment of a notification
    function for the transporters approaching the construction site, and accommodating
    the different roles of sales managers and invoice issuers within the same supplier

- en: The tests were carried out in two iterations, each following the corresponding
    development round. When the first test round was planned for August 2020, it was
    hoped that we could conduct on-site introductory training, observations, and interviews.
    However, all of these were carried out online through Microsoft Teams, due to
    COVID-19-related restrictions that were still ongoing as of the second half of
    2020 and the first half of 2021\. In the first field testing iteration, a series
    of meetings were conducted with the testers over the span of two weeks, in order
    to guide them through the installation, functionality and interface of BLogCHAIN.
    Afterward, the tests took place through the rest of November and December, having
    designated the end-of-year vacation period as the stopping point of the tests.
    The tests consisted of the collaborating suppliers and contractor’s operatives
    carrying out logistics transactions through BLogCHAIN. In order to not disturb
    the everyday work, we agreed with the testers that the implementation of BLogCHAIN
    would run in parallel to the established way in which the supply chain transactions
    were already made—and not in replacement of those practices. During the tests,
    we conducted semi-structured interviews with the testers and engaged in observations
    as they used the application. The feedback after the first field testing iteration
    was received through semi-structured interviews with all the testers, in order
    to record their user experiences. This amounted to four interviews with supplier
    representatives and one group interview with four of the contractor’s site managers,
    where the previously mentioned improvements for the second development iteration
    were proposed.

  zh: 测试分两个迭代进行，每个迭代都紧随相应的开发轮次。在8月2020年计划进行第一轮测试时，希望能进行现场入门培训、观察和面试。然而，由于COVID-19相关限制仍在2020年下半年和2021年上半年持续进行，所有这些都通过Microsoft
    Teams在线进行。在第一轮现场测试迭代中，在两周内进行了一系列与测试人员的会议，以指导他们安装、功能和BLogCHAIN接口。之后，测试持续到11月和12月，将年末假期作为测试的停止点。测试包括合作供应商和承包商的操作人员通过BLogCHAIN进行物流交易。为了不干扰日常工作，我们与测试人员达成协议，BLogCHAIN的实施将与已建立的供应链交易方式并行运行，而不是取代这些做法。在测试过程中，我们进行了与测试人员的半结构化访谈，并观察他们使用应用程序的情况。在第一轮现场测试迭代结束后，通过与所有测试人员进行半结构化访谈，记录了他们的用户体验。供应商代表进行了四次访谈，承包商现场经理中的四人进行了一次集体访谈，提出了第二次开发迭代的改进建议。

    after this iteration was also organized as a series of interviews with site management

    but this was hampered by practical barriers. This feedback was used to evaluate
    the proof-of-concept, by aiming at understanding the potential alterations in
    the work practices realized through BLogCHAIN, noting which of the previously
    envisioned benefits and drawbacks of the blockchain solution did or did not materialize,
    documenting the pilot’s limitations, and gathering recommendations for its improvement
    and expansion. This was complemented by our literature review insights, our sociomaterial

    technologies in [[28](#CR28)].

- en: 'Although there have been numerous studies mapping the potential of blockchain
    technology within several fields of the construction industry (see, e.g. in [[29](#CR29)]),
    the current chapter is particularly interested in blockchain research for construction
    supply chains and logistics [[30](#CR30)]. Within that focus, it has been claimed
    that digital distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), which include blockchains,
    can mitigate the disorder caused by changes in the construction supply chain strategy,
    thus reducing the suppliers’ uneasiness due to withheld payments or other insolvencies
    [[31](#CR31)]. References [[11](#CR11), [32](#CR32), [33](#CR33)] posed that the
    information flow in downstream supply chain segments can be improved through the
    transparency and traceability brought by blockchain, and following [[33](#CR33)],
    an expert panel feasibility assessment of blockchain’s ability to mitigate payment
    issues was carried out in [[10](#CR10)]. The possible improvement of on-site logistics
    through the integration of blockchain with RFID sensor data was studied in [[34](#CR34)].
    The claim that transactions through a blockchain network can result in dynamic
    and instant payments for suppliers, transporters, and subcontractors, as well
    as better communication with the main contractor, was made in [[35](#CR35)]; however,
    in [[10](#CR10)] there is more caution in the evaluation of possible improvements
    of payment practices, which on the other hand do point to the potential of shorter
    payment times (even if not instant). Moreover, the visibility of the complete
    transactional history across the supply chain, as well as the consensus requirement
    for the block updates, are positively noted for possibly tackling the tampering
    with past logistics data [[35](#CR35)], and productivity and efficiency issues
    [[36](#CR36), [37](#CR37)]. Furthermore, blockchain is envisioned to reduce administrative
    rework (e.g. matching data among different supplier ledgers for multiple deliveries)
    and data errors and outages across the supply chain, thus leading to time and
    cost savings, better change management, better planning, and quick (even instant)
    delivery notice for the contractors [[35](#CR35)]. Accordingly, three key legal
    issues were identified in the potential of a relevant implementation: the restricted
    use of smart contracts to prescribed outcomes, the shared data access and ownership,
    and multi-jurisdiction concerns related to governing regulations and laws [[38](#CR38)].
    The utility of blockchain in making data transactions transparent and immutable
    in order to estimate the embodied carbon emissions along construction supply chains,
    was explored in [[39](#CR39)]. To accommodate blockchain, construction supply
    chains and logistics would require the conceptualization and development of operational
    processes that align with the roles and responsibilities of the supply chain actors
    [[40](#CR40)]. This alignment involves tackling issues of data tracking and contracting
    and transferring resources—thus mitigating the opportunistic behaviors of supply
    chain actors and shifting the trust from relational to system- and cognition-based
    [[41](#CR41)]. Furthermore, it has been shown that crypto-assets [[42](#CR42)]
    and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) [[43](#CR43)] can enhance both the granularity
    and the atomicity of the integration between the ‘cash’ and ‘product’ flows in
    construction supply chains. In a relevant vein, three blockchain-based models
    were developed, namely project bank accounts for payments, reverse auction-based
    tendering for bidding, and asset tokenization for project financing; the need
    to upscale the legacy IT systems and facilitate regulatory compliance, was highlighted
    [[44](#CR44)]. Finally, while in [[30](#CR30)] blockchain is envisioned to streamline
    a ‘green lean’ construction supply chain, [[45](#CR45)] elaborates on turning
    construction resources (e.g. materials, components) into smart construction objects
    by infusing their properties with a ‘smart’ layer of awareness, communicativeness,
    and autonomy, and then using those as blockchain oracles in construction supply
    chain management. In this context, an oracle is understood as a middleware capturing,
    validating, and then feeding information into a smart contract [[45](#CR45)].'

  zh: 尽管已经有许多研究在建筑行业的多个领域中对区块链技术的潜力进行了映射（见例如[[29](#CR29)]），但当前章节特别关注区块链在建筑供应链和物流方面的研究[[30](#CR30)]。在这个焦点内，有人声称数字分布式账本技术（DLTs），包括区块链，可以缓解施工供应链战略变更所引起的混乱，从而减少供应商因拖欠付款或其他破产而感到不安[[31](#CR31)]。参考文献[[11](#CR11),
    [32](#CR32), [33](#CR33)]指出，区块链带来的透明度和可追溯性可以改善下游供应链环节的信息流，随后[[33](#CR33)]进行了专家小组的区块链能否解决支付问题的可行性评估[[10](#CR10)].
    研究了通过将区块链与RFID传感器数据整合来可能改善现场物流[[34](#CR34)]。 声称使用区块链网络进行交易可以实现对供应商、运输商和分包商的动态和即时支付，以及与主承包商更好的沟通[[35](#CR35)]；然而，在[[10](#CR10)]中对可能的支付改进的评估更加谨慎，尽管未达到即时支付的水平，也指出了支付时间更短的潜力。此外，完整的供应链交易历史的可见性，以及对区块更新的共识要求，被认为可能有利于应对篡改过去物流数据的问题[[35](#CR35)]，以及生产力和效率问题[[36](#CR36),
    [37](#CR37)]。 此外，预计区块链可以减少供应链中的行政重做（例如匹配多次交付的不同供应商账本中的数据）和数据错误和中断，从而节省时间和成本，改善变更管理，改进规划，并为承包商提供快速（甚至即时）的交付通知[[35](#CR35)]。相应地，在相关实施的潜力中，确定了三个关键的法律问题：智能合同的受限使用，共享数据访问和所有权，以及与法规和法律相关的多管辖区问题[[38](#CR38)]。在建筑供应链中对区块链的实用性，用以使数据交易透明和不可改变，以估计沿着建筑供应链的碳排放，进行了探讨[[39](#CR39)]。
    为了适应区块链，建筑供应链和物流需要构想并制定与供应链参与者的角色和责任相一致的运营流程[[40](#CR40)]。 这种调整涉及解决数据跟踪和合同以及转移资源的问题，从而减少供应链参与者的机会主义行为，并将信任从关系型转移到系统和认知为基础[[41](#CR41)]。
    此外，已经表明，加密资产[[42](#CR42)]和非同质化代币（NFTs）[[43](#CR43)]可以增强建筑供应链中“现金”和“产品”流之间的集成的细化程度和原子性。相关的是，三种基于区块链的模型被开发出来，即用于付款的项目银行账户，用于投标的反向拍卖式招标，以及用于项目融资的资产代币化;
    需要升级传统的IT系统，并促进监管合规，以强调[[44](#CR44)]。 最后，尽管在[[30](#CR30)]中，区块链被设想用于简化“绿色精益”建筑供应链，[[45](#CR45)]着重于将建筑资源（例如材料、组件）转化为具有“智能”意识、沟通性和自主性的“智能”建筑对象，然后将其用作建筑供应链管理中的区块链或预言机。在这种情况下，预言机被理解为捕获、验证，然后将信息输入智能合同的中间件[[45](#CR45)]。

    and then [[8](#CR8)] have gradually investigated the integration of the material,
    economic and information flows along the supply chain, through a blockchain solution
    forming part of the value proposition in independent logistic consultants’ business
    models. In particular, [[12](#CR12)] investigated the suitability of Swedish construction
    supply chains and logistics for accommodating a blockchain solution integrating
    the logistics flows, by involving independent logistics consultants that can incorporate
    such a solution in their digital business model; the study then proceeded with
    a preliminary mapping of such consultancies operating in Sweden. The perspective
    of sociomateriality in relation to a potential blockchain solution for integrated
    logistics flows, and the power shifts that such a solution would bring in constellations
    of supply chain actors in the Swedish context, were introduced in [[13](#CR13)].
    These constellations included the typical case of large contractors internalizing
    logistics services, the atypical case of using independent logistics consultants,
    and the emergent case of third-party actors offering dedicated digital building
    logistics services [[13](#CR13)]. Moreover, sociomateriality was used to map potential
    benefits and threats related to blockchain visions and prototypes for construction
    (documented mainly in industry reports), and discuss the way those can be extrapolated
    to a solution for integrated supply chain and logistics flows in the Swedish context
    [[14](#CR14)]. Finally, a sociomaterial conceptualization of such a solution was
    offered in [[8](#CR8)], where the ways a generic logistics setup can be transformed,
    were mapped; then, it was planted in a conceptual digital business model canvas
    for independent logistics consultants, and the canvas was customized on the business
    case of a specific firm (with the input of the company’s representatives themselves)

    of a blockchain solution and bring attention to the issue of flow integration.
    However, while their context-specific approach can be considered methodologically
    strong due to taking institutional particularities into account, it also makes

- en: Finally, the potential constraints and security issues regarding the implementation
    of blockchain in construction logistics, were explicitly considered only in [[8](#CR8),
    [14](#CR14), [36](#CR36)]. Interestingly, all of these studies looked into blockchain-related
    research outside construction to formulate their argumentation. Regarding implementation
    constraints, these studies collectively posed that for supply chains and logistics,
    blockchain should only be adopted if it leads to the achievement of strategic
    objectives (e.g. reduction of rework), and that there are strategic factors that
    can impede blockchain’s adoption, including a limited engagement with the technology
    and a limited context awareness. Considering security, these studies highlight
    two common denominators. The first is a presumptive mistrust of the potential
    of blockchain as a viable technological investment. The second is an anticipated
    abuse of the properties of blockchain; the anonymity of the distributed node network
    could lead to illicit activities, the use of cryptocurrencies to losing grasp
    of the value of fiat currencies, and the inflexibility of transactions through
    smart contracts to potentially emerging tensions among the actors in the blockchain
    network.

    that the development of our application would have to depart from the concept
    in Fig. [1](#Fig1), and lead to a simplified and/or altered proof-of-concept (see
    also ‘Method’). Specifically, the only actors enacting transactions, as well as
    participating in the consensus checks, would be the contractor’s site managers,
    the suppliers’ sales representatives, and (conditionally) the transporters. The
    design of the prototype was updated to reflect that the stream of the material,
    economic and information flows on which it was to be implemented and attempt the
    flow integration, would start when the supplier issued the confirmation of the
    order already placed by the contractor, and finish with the contractor accepting
    (or not) the supplier’s invoice (issued after the material delivery had taken
    place). As such, the new concept, used for the first development iteration of

    suitable for both desktop computers and smartphones, and is in Swedish. The blockchain
    infrastructure of BLogCHAIN utilizes the open-source Hyperledger Besu framework,
    and can be accessed through MetaMask, a crypto-wallet and gateway to blockchain
    applications. MetaMask functions as an extension for Google Chrome, and can also
    be downloaded as an app in Google Play and the App Store (for smartphones, and
    iPhones, respectively). The files to be uploaded to the online repository connected
    to BLogCHAIN (e.g. invoices) should be in PDF format, and they are encrypted in
    Microsoft Azure. As BLogCHAIN constitutes a private permissioned blockchain that
    is eligible for access only through an actively permitted MetaMask account, the
    website cannot be openly accessed, and as such, the respective URL is not shown

    created dummy contractor, supplier and transporter accounts and conducted test
    transactions. This process lasted for about a week, in which various minor bugs

- en: Following was the first testing iteration, which consisted of transactions between
    the contractor and two out of the three suppliers that were contacted. One supplier
    was responsible for delivering concrete and aggregates of a varying granulometric
    gradation, and the other delivering an assortment of lighter materials (primarily
    wood). These transactions were infrequent and spread during the testing period
    of late November and into December 2020\. As a result, only a handful of transactions
    were recorded on BLogCHAIN by the end of this testing period. This infrequency
    and sparseness had to do with the construction phase, which mostly entailed a
    few bulk deliveries of construction materials, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic
    crisis, which detained (to a certain degree) the supply chain and logistics processes.

- en: The third supplier (delivering reinforcement steel) had been present in the
    preparatory stage and had also installed BLogCHAIN after its development, but
    they ended up not using the application at all. Shortly after the installation,
    this supplier informed us that their company already deployed an automated digital
    system for handling the flows between them and the contractor (e.g. issuing invoices).
    This system was deemed by the supplier to be as optimized as needed for the company’s
    business model, and therefore the supplier declined participating in testing BLogCHAIN
    even in parallel to their established work practices.

- en: The feedback after the second testing iteration was acquired through one interview
    with each of the supplies, and one with the contractor’s site management representatives.
    Overall, the feedback consisted of mainly positive and constructive comments.
    With regard to the positive comments, it was mentioned that BLogCHAIN creates
    a clear connection between the supplier and the contractor, while the confirmation
    function in the app allows this connection to be documented and available for
    different roles in the supply chain (and not just individuals). Moreover, its
    ability to bring together and connect the supply chain actors was highlighted
    as an improvement, as ‘in current practices, e.g. e-mails between individuals,
    they cannot do the same thing, as the individual can disappear, and the information
    can disappear or get mixed up among different people, or it is even difficult
    to access/follow it up’ (according to one interviewee). It can possibly be understood
    that this comment mainly referred to the information flow. Furthermore, BLogCHAIN
    creates a ready-made platform where everyone can join, as ‘the key is that everyone
    in the industry must gather around a common interface’ (according to one interviewee).
    It was also noted that even though there might be no major problems with invoices
    and approvals today, planned meetings for clarifications (e.g. at the end of the
    month) were needed—and the app, through the overview it offers, could potentially
    reduce the need for such meetings. Finally, the app was praised for making it
    possible to quickly satisfy requests of finding and showing the right order confirmation—through
    BLogCHAIN, it is possible to quickly get details out of the purchase, and know
    exactly what the customer previously bought (and of which they now want to buy
    more, or on which they now want to make a complaint).

  zh: 第二轮测试迭代后的反馈是通过与每个供应商进行一次访谈和与承包商现场管理代表进行一次访谈来获取的。总的来说，反馈主要是积极和建设性的评论。关于积极的评论，有提到BLogCHAIN在供应商和承包商之间建立了明确的联系，而应用程序中的确认功能允许这种联系被记录下来并提供给供应链中的不同角色（而不只是个人）。此外，它将供应链角色聚集起来并连接起来的能力被强调为一种改进，因为“在当前的惯例中，例如个人之间的邮件沟通，他们无法做到同样的事情，因为个人可能会消失，信息可能会消失或混在不同的人之间，或者甚至很难访问/跟进”（根据一位受访者的说法）。可以理解这条评论主要是指信息流。此外，BLogCHAIN创建了一个现成的平台，每个人都可以加入，因为“关键在于行业中的每个人必须围绕一个共同的接口聚集”（根据一位受访者的说法）。还指出，即使当今可能没有重大问题涉及发票和批准，也需要计划好澄清的会议（例如在月底）-并且这个应用程序通过它提供的概览，可能会减少这类会议的需求。最后，该应用程序因可以快速满足查找和展示正确订单确认的请求而受到赞扬-通过BLogCHAIN，可以快速了解采购的详情，并且准确知道客户之前购买了什么（以及他们现在想再购买更多，或者现在想投诉什么）。
- en: When it comes to the constructive comments, it should be mentioned that we were
    not given a really critical feedback. However, not all testers felt that any substantial
    value was generated for them by using BLogCHAIN. Specifically, one company shared
    that they are in the process of developing a system with similar functions, although
    not based on blockchain; it remains to be seen how another base technology can
    lead to ‘similar functions’. The benefits, costs and risks of handling payments
    via a common blockchain solution instead of the parties’ current systems, were
    considered to be not self-evident and impossible to calculate. The cost of internal
    administration at each party is not clear and there are probably more aspects
    that need to be highlighted. Another supplier declared that apart from a visible
    approval of the order confirmation, no major benefit was generated for them, as
    they already have a functioning system. The same company highlights that there
    are different issues depending on the material to be delivered, and therefore
    the app is too generic to be of real interest. However, the same company highlighted
    that they distrust the industry’s ability to adapt to new technologies (regardless
    of the type). This last comment can be interpreted as emanating mostly from a
    concern on the institutional aspects of the industry (‘slow to adapt’), rather
    than the app in itself.

    a lack of joint planning, a risk of parallel orders and other processes, and disorientation
    among actors active in the pursuit of integrating and defragmenting parallel material
    flows and logistics. The tests of the prototype showed the way a more integrated
    management of received goods can be done on-site, by using BLogCHAIN as a common
    tool. The tests also showed that stronger integration between, on the one hand,
    suppliers and their IT systems and, on the other hand, accountants and their ledger
    systems, is an attractive potential.

- en: Taking the reduction of transactions into account, the information and economic
    flows nowadays require constant checking by a series of professionals. These checks
    thus imply constant human intermediation. As such, disintermediation (i.e. reducing
    human intervention), has a large potential for generating a surplus for the involved
    companies [[20](#CR20), [46](#CR46)]. However, our tests did not directly show
    a realization of this potential. BLogCHAIN operated as a stand-alone application,
    and as such, it increased rather than decreased the needed intermediation. Moreover,
    the longer-term possibilities of overseeing, e.g., monthly transactions, have
    not been tested.

  zh: 考虑到交易的减少，如今信息和经济流动需要一系列专业人士的不断检查。因此，这些检查意味着不断的人为干预。因此，去中介化（即减少人为干预）对于相关公司而言有着很大的潜力，可以产生剩余价值
    [[20](#CR20), [46](#CR46)]。然而，我们的测试并未直接显示这一潜力的实现。BLogCHAIN作为一款独立应用程序运行，因此增加了所需的中介，而非减少。此外，长期监督，比如每月交易的可能性还未经过测试。
- en: 'Considering transparency, we characterize blockchain as a trust-based technology:
    it requires trust amongst the logistics actors but can also develop transparency-based
    trust. Public permissionless blockchains (such as the ones based on proof-of-work),
    do constitute open systems accessible to all. Such transparency is believed to
    be paired with the irreversibility of the conducted transactions, which is seen
    to assure that the system cannot be tampered with. However, BLogCHAIN is a permissioned
    system, only allowing actual members of the supply chain as users [[28](#CR28)].
    This type of limited trust, higher security and partial information privacy appears
    to have worked well in the tests and did not receive any negative comments. It
    actually seemed to have been taken for granted, as expected in blockchain applications
    [[28](#CR28)]. Nonetheless, if blockchain is supposed to support a more client-oriented
    constellation, then it is more suitable in an atypical (‘more egalitarian’) constellation,
    e.g. a partnering project where mutual trust (‘opening one’s books’) is declared.'

  zh: 在透明度方面，我们将区块链描述为一种基于信任的技术：它需要物流参与者之间的信任，但也可以发展基于透明度的信任。公开的无许可区块链（如基于工作证明的区块链）构成面向所有人的开放系统。这种透明度被认为与所进行交易的不可逆转性相配合，这被视为保证了系统不会被篡改。然而，BLogCHAIN是一种有权限的系统，只允许供应链的实际成员作为用户[[28](#CR28)]。这种有限的信任、更高的安全性和部分信息隐私似乎在测试中表现良好，并未收到任何负面评论。事实上，这似乎被视为理所当然，这也是区块链应用程序中所预期的。然而，如果区块链应该支持更加客户导向的结构，那么它更适合于非典型（‘更平等’）的结构，例如合作项目，其中彼此的信任（‘公开账本’）被宣称。
- en: For the dimension of value creation, we consider that presently, construction
    logistics are hampered by continuous tensions about deliveries and payments. In
    2019, Swedish companies paid their bills on an average of 33 days after receiving
    them [[44](#CR44)]—even if standard conditions clearly delimit this span to 28 days.
    Moreover, conscious late payment is viewed as accounting for 50% of the total
    payments. Therefore, the potential for agreeing on an automated payment is huge.
    The creditor can realize direct monetary advantages when receiving payment just
    3–5 days earlier than the present average practice, and the debtor can avoid constant
    attention to paying at a late time, thus reducing human intermediation. Moreover,
    one can imagine rebates and other services included in agreements for the purchaser
    [[9](#CR9), [49](#CR49)]. It should therefore be possible to create a joint value
    creation—a win–win situation—with smart contracts.

  zh: 就价值创造维度而言，我们认为目前，建筑物流受到持续的交货和付款压力的阻碍。2019年，瑞典公司在收到账单后平均33天才支付账单[[44](#CR44)]，即使标准条件明确规定这个时间段为28天。此外，有意的延迟支付被认为占总支付的50%。因此，自动支付的潜力是巨大的。债权人在比现行平均实践提前3-5天收到款项时可以实现直接的经济优势，债务人可以避免在后期支付时需要不断关注，从而减少人为干预。此外，人们可以想象将折扣和其他服务包括在购买者的协议中[[9](#CR9),
    [49](#CR49)]。因此，应该可以创建共同的价值创造——一种双赢局面，即使用智能合同。
- en: In particular, smart contracts can support agreements specifying e.g. annual
    purchasing volumes, delivery, and quality conditions, and set prices. However,
    it is likely that the ability to deviate from the smart contracts at a later stage
    will be welcomed, as site managers are quite often able to negotiate better conditions
    than the initial (and by convention, immutable) clauses prescribed in a smart
    contract. In other words, there is a risk related to smart contracts, where they
    become a top-down instrument for management, to the detriment of the project constellation.
    As a case in point, we introduced optional checks as flexible clauses in BLogCHAIN.
    These were received well by the suppliers, but treated with some skepticism by
    the contractor’s site managers. However, it remains to be seen if such simple
    solutions can account for a larger-scale implementation, where numerous conflicting
    flows and hundreds of transactions might have to be performed simultaneously.

  zh: 特别地，智能合同能支持规定例如年度采购数量、交付和质量条件，并设定价格的协议。然而，很可能后期能够偏离智能合同将受到欢迎，因为现场经理往往能够就比智能合同规定的最初（按照惯例是不可变的）条款谈判出更好的条件。换句话说，智能合同存在风险，它们可能成为管理的自上而下工具，损害项目结构。例如，我们在BLogCHAIN中引入了可选检查作为灵活条款。供应商对此反应良好，但承包商的现场经理对此持一定怀疑态度。然而，现在有待验证这样简单的解决方案是否能适用于更大规模的实施，其中可能需要同时进行大量相互冲突的流程和数百笔交易。
- en: Finally, the results on the dimension of implementation show that while substantial
    time and resources were invested in the initial concept of BLogCHAIN, updates
    and remarks that came later were also important—as those latter updates were very
    specific to the context of the construction site that served as the testing ground.
    Even little conceptual and preparatory changes had a far-reaching effect on the
    development process itself. Moreover, a set of interesting insights regarding
    late invoice payments and their possible amelioration through blockchain, emerged
    from the final round of interviews. Specifically, it was discussed that there
    are different driving forces for those delays, such as the client having difficulties
    paying due to financial problems, consciously paying late (either to make capital
    gains, or due to uncertainties about the deal), and even withholding the entire
    payment in case of ambiguity of parts of the delivery. Suppliers tend to avoid
    clients with financial difficulties, but the issue of consciously paying late
    appears mainly in ‘serious’ clients. There is a consensus among suppliers and
    clients that both parties contribute to this situation and it is not the respective
    company's internal payment routines per se that are the problem. As no interviewed
    party had a clear picture of the cost of internal administration of complaints/disputes
    regarding invoices, the actual problems seem to arise during the validation of
    the received goods and getting the correct information in the invoice. As such,
    late payments by ‘serious’ customers seem to be largely due to deficiencies in
    the contractor's delivery receipt control, which are only discovered when it is
    the time for the contractors to administer the payment.

  zh: 最后，对于实施维度的结果显示，虽然在最初的BLogCHAIN概念上投入了大量时间和资源，但后来的更新和备注也同样重要——因为后来的更新与作为测试基地的施工现场的具体情况密切相关。甚至是一些概念性和准备性的小改变也对开发过程本身产生了深远影响。此外，从最后一轮访谈中出现了一组有关迟付发票及其通过区块链可能改善的有趣见解。具体来说，讨论了导致这些迟付的不同动因，例如客户因财务问题而难以支付，故意迟迟支付（要么是为了获得资金收益，要么是因为交易不确定性），甚至在收到产品的特定部分模糊时可以拒付整笔款项。供应商倾向于避免与财务困难的客户合作，但故意迟付的问题似乎主要出现在‘严肃’客户身上。供应商和客户都一致认为双方都在造成这种情况，并不是公司内部支付流程本身出了问题。由于接受访谈的各方并没有对关于发票的内部投诉/争端管理的真实成本有清晰的了解，实际问题似乎都出现在验证收到货物和在发票中得到正确信息的过程中。因此，‘严肃’客户的迟付似乎在很大程度上是由于承包商交付收据控制的缺陷，在只有在承包商进行付款管理时才得以发现。

- en: Nonetheless, both iterations of the development were sociomaterially informed
    by the in-between professional relationships of the participating testing parties.
    The resulting simplification of the concept, and as such the developmental process
    itself, led to the choice of widely used and relatively standard development tools
    in the field of blockchain and smart contracts (i.e. Hyperledger Besu, MetaMask,
    and Microsoft Azure). The absence of more ‘exotic’ choices did not harm the development
    of BLogCHAIN, but rather the opposite—it facilitated a streamlined process, and
    a relatively simple, understandable functionality and UI in the prototype itself,
    which helped the testers grasp it quicker. Streamlining, quickness and ease were
    essential for the testers, as this meant fewer disruptions in their normal day-to-day
    tasks. Such a reduced disruption was also facilitated by running the tests in
    parallel to (and not replacing) the business-as-usual transactions, after a bilateral

    Besu，MetaMask和Microsoft Azure）。更‘异国情调’的选择的缺失并没有对BLogCHAIN的开发造成伤害，而相反—它促进了一个简化的流程，以及在原型本身中相对简单、易理解的功能和用户界面，这有助于测试人员更快地掌握它。简化、快速和容易对测试人员至关重要，因为这意味着在他们日常工作中减少干扰。通过与测试人员达成双边协议后，同时（而不是替代）日常业务交易进行并行测试也有助于减少这种干扰。
- en: The sociomaterial perspective can also emphasize the way blockchain would be
    intertwined with changes in practices through implementation. In the current case,
    such an implementation encompassed preparatory interviews, introduction meetings
    when the prototype was ready for testing, and one-to-one sessions with each user
    setting up their account for BLogCHAIN. During the tests, a continuous online
    support was offered. The kickoff was a typical example of a common implementation
    process of digitalization—first-time users struggling with the basic function
    of the MetaMask shell and the entries in the blockchain itself. But these ‘early
    symptoms’ were overcome relatively quickly. A more thorough embedding would extend
    beyond the two testing periods, and a crucial moment for future adoption would
    be when the use of the system goes beyond a single case and becomes standard software
    for the central users.

    confirmations and invoices can enter the app automatically. Expansions in its
    utility, like the coupling with a scanning function upon receipt of incoming goods,
    enacting payments (probably requiring cryptocurrencies), connecting the information
    in the app with future additional sales from, e.g. the end customer, and using

    payments (e.g. when a defect is found in parts of the delivered goods), as well
    as regulating transactional disputes within the contractor firm itself, were suggested.
    Finally, a major proposal was the creation of an aftermarket case in the app;
    interestingly, to illustrate the need for this, a piece of the received feedback
    by an interviewee went thus: ‘If a part of the invoice is questioned, the supplier
    can accept or reject the complaint; the contractor can then withhold payment for
    the disputed part—but pay the rest of the invoice. Today it is common for the
    contractor to withhold the entire amount. To make things clearer, let’s say that
    a supplier delivers with a 30-day payment time. Receipt is approved. The material
    is assembled after 15 days, and after assembly a defect is found in the material.
    The contractor then withholds the entire invoice. It then becomes a dispute where

- en: The choice of sociomateriality as our theoretical framework reflects not only
    our considerations on the way blockchain, a general-purpose technology, can be
    properly contextualized within Swedish construction supply chain and logistics
    setups—but also our empirical understanding of the real-life function of such
    setups. Rather than viewing the respective actions as technical choices among
    rationally discernible operational models (which is recurrent in the approaches
    of operations management and business economics), we interpret them as different
    solutions involving characteristic distributions of power. This evidently means
    that the investigated operational framework is not limited to knowledge exchange
    [[51](#CR51)], but also constitutes a political game that is co-shaped along the
    utilized technological framework. Moreover, since large urban construction sites
    can suffer from theft and shrinkage in material supplies, at least internal trust
    among the actors in a (partially) decentralized blockchain network, should be
    cultivated. However, supporting an outright permissionless setup can be difficult.
    Thus, a permissioned private system (like BLogCHAIN) that can establish procedures
    to protect the blockchain network both from external threats and internal instabilities,
    is informed by existing sociomaterial conditions. Furthermore, deeply integrating
    the new technology evidently involves technical interoperability issues, as well
    as changes in the participating companies’ work practices, social setups and organizational
    structure. Our sociomaterial understanding (also reflected in the testing of BLogCHAIN)
    places the blockchain solution in parallel or on top of an information infrastructure
    consisting of different accounting, project planning, site planning, quality control,
    and access control systems; then, the adoption of common standards for the structuring

    The integration occurred among members of site management supporting transparent
    coordination. Deficiencies in coordination are known to create quality defects,

    truck deliveries can reduce waiting times and on-site work interruptions). The
    opportunity for reduced transactions relates to the order and accounting processes

  zh: 通过API的系统瓦解似乎是BLogCHAIN运作的主要缺陷。与其他系统的整合对于为参与者创造价值至关重要。此外，这样的价值可能被本研究的范围所划定；与国际建筑背景中所阐述的愿景和原型的大量区块链应用相比，BLogCHAIN可以被解释为定位在一个小的利基市场，这也可能意味着行业的分化正在向着真正应用区块链的方向发展。然而，这也可能意味着这种通用技术被分散到各种不同的应用中，而建筑物流只是其中之一，并且尚未被广泛研究。因此，应认识到区块链是一种需要情境化的通用技术——换句话说，是一种拥有广泛应用可能性的空壳，在任何真正的价值创造之前都需要开发。
- en: The hindrances and barriers in adopting the solution, should also be contextualized
    and attributed to current issues that need to be overcome—such as data unavailability,
    relative lack of blockchain awareness, and the existing power balances within
    sociomaterial constellations. In the future, it would be interesting to also address
    the issues around payments. As mentioned above, if a blockchain- and smart contract-based
    solution can obtain payments just a few days quicker than the current practice,
    the business value potential is huge [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10), [50](#CR50)].

    logistics (in which the information, material and economic flows are integrated
    in an event-driven way via a suitable technology), as well as the results of its
    conceptualization, development, implementation and testing in a context-conscious
    manner, could be—by proposing a blockchain solution.

  zh: 本研究探讨了建筑物流解决方案的研究问题（通过适当的技术以事件驱动的方式集成信息、物资和经济流动），以及其在有意识地环境下的概念化、开发、实施和测试结果，提出了区块链解决方案。
- en: Our literature review on, specifically, blockchain for construction supply chains
    and logistics, delineates a number of benefits emanating from core blockchain
    properties (e.g. the reduction of administrative and accounting rework, and a
    more efficient payment practice); however, the studies reflect a maturity level
    no higher than that of prototypes, and no solutions implemented into actual use
    cases have been found. Moreover, few studies have adopted a sociomaterial lens
    considering a strong embedding in practices.

  zh: 我们对建筑供应链和物流领域区块链的文献综述阐明了核心区块链属性带来的诸多好处（例如减少行政和会计重做，以及更有效的支付实践）；然而，这些研究反映出的成熟程度不超过原型机的水平，没有发现实际使用案例中采用的解决方案。而且，很少有研究采用了社会物质镜头，考虑到强烈的实践融入。
- en: The conceptual solution described in the current chapter, emerged into an event-driven,
    blockchain-induced flow integration across a segment of downstream logistics,
    i.e. from the issuing of purchasing orders until the completion of the on-site
    deliveries. The envisaged benefits of the solution included (among others) the
    streamlining, integration and transparency of logistics processes, and value creation.
    However, certain issues (mostly tied to the wider construction context) have to
    be addressed, so that the realization of such value will not be hindered; such
    issues include, among others, data unavailability, a relative lack of wide blockchain
    awareness, and the existing power balances within sociomaterial constellations.

  zh: 当前章节中描述的概念解决方案，转变为基于事件驱动的、由区块链引发的流程整合，覆盖了下游物流的一个部分，即从采购订单的发行到现场交付的完成。该解决方案的预期好处包括（等等）物流流程的简化、整合和透明度，以及价值创造。然而，必须解决一些问题（主要与更广泛的建筑背景相关），以防止这种价值的实现受到阻碍；这些问题包括，但不限于，数据不可用、相对缺乏广泛的区块链意识，以及社会材料组织内部的现有权力平衡。
- en: The development, tests and evaluation of BLogCHAIN commenced with the prospective
    testers’ experiences informing the development process itself, the evolution of
    the pilot’s utility was informed by the way it was used during the tests, and
    the recommendations we got afterward were informed by the work practices in the
    supply chain and logistics constellation at the testing site. These have thus
    constituted a sociomaterial co-shaping of the digital technology with the related
    practices during testing, and with further implications for future implementation.
    Moreover, the sociomaterial approach considers the distribution of power within
    the logistics setup and leads to the understanding of mutual trust as a crucial
    issue in blockchain adoption. A permissioned private system can establish procedures
    to protect the blockchain network both from external and internal threats and/or
    abuse; in other words, supporting an outright permissionless system is here seen
    as an abstracted vision with little bearing. From a future perspective, integrating
    the new technology would change the work practices and social setups of the participating
    actors.

  zh: BLogCHAIN的开发、测试和评估始于潜在测试人员的经验，这些经验指导了开发过程本身，而测试过程中的使用方式则指导了试点实用性的发展，之后我们得到的建议则是基于供应链和物流组织的工作实践。因此，这些都构成了数字技术在测试期间与相关实践的社会材料共同塑造，并对未来实施产生了更多的影响。此外，社会材料方法考虑了物流设置内部权力的分配，并导致了对相互信任的理解作为区块链采用中的关键问题。许可的私有系统可以建立程序来保护区块链网络免受外部和内部威胁或滥用；换句话说，在这里，支持完全无需许可的系统被视为一个抽象的愿景，对此几乎没有影响。从未来的角度来看，整合新技术将改变参与方的工作实践和社会设置。
- en: The created value for the users and companies involved was limited in the test,
    but nonetheless demonstrated the utility of blockchain in increasing integration,
    facilitating the opportunity of a reduced number of transactions, increasing transparency,
    and creating opportunities for future value creation. The integration and transparency
    occurred among members of site management supporting transparent coordination.
    The opportunity for reduced transactions and value creation remained mostly as
    future options, as the system was tested in a context-specific, stand-alone prototype.
    BLogCHAIN also highlighted the possibility of a more active and digitally supported
    client’s role, by providing them with valuable knowledge through the online surveillance
    of logistics flows (especially the economic flow).

  zh: 为用户和参与公司创造的价值在测试中是有限的，但仍然证明了区块链在增加整合、促进减少交易次数、增加透明度和创造未来价值方面的效用。透明的协调支持，使得网站管理成员之间的整合和透明度得以实现。减少交易和价值创造的机会基本上还是未来的选择，因为该系统在特定上下文中进行了测试，并且是一个独立的原型。BLogCHAIN还强调了通过在线监测物流流程（尤其是经济流程）为客户提供宝贵知识，以实现客户更积极、更数字化的角色的可能性。
- en: The limitations of this study include the choice of a particular context in
    a specific construction logistics setup, for which the presented blockchain solution
    was developed. The main downside of this choice is that the same conceptualization
    cannot be easily replicated for other contexts unless new context-specific analyses
    are first conducted. Moreover, it was planned from the outset to interact with
    a limited set of suppliers and transporters. The amount of such partners was further
    reduced when focusing on an early phase of a building project that served as the
    testing ground. This subsequently reduced the input concerning improvements for
    the app—making the number of participants and corresponding transactions more
    manageable, but also tending to simplify the test. An additional test iteration
    in a later (and more complex) phase of the building project was originally planned,
    but this proved impossible to follow through. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19
    pandemic restrictions, the preparatory interviews and the follow-up evaluation
    interviews were carried out over virtual communication tools. The empirical material
    generated in this manner was interpreted as sufficient to fulfil the study’s goals—but
    we believe that had we been able to be on-site during the preparatory work and
    the tests, it would have generated stronger research material. Additionally, it
    should be noted that the conceptual development, the prototype, and the testing,
    came to be focused on the logistics segment until delivery at the site gate, whereas
    processes inside the construction site were not prioritized. Finally, BLogCHAIN
    emerged as a stand-alone system that was tested in parallel to established work
    practices. This limits the test results, as a tighter integration with the ordering/accounting
    systems (and the respective flows) might have strengthened the test participants’
    understanding of the blockchain’s potential.

  zh: 该研究的局限性包括选择了特定施工物流环境，该环境是开发所述区块链解决方案的特定建设物流设置。选择的主要缺点是，除非首先进行新的特定上下文分析，否则同样的概念化无法轻易复制到其他环境。此外，从一开始就计划与少数供应商和运输商互动。当专注于作为测试基础的建筑项目早期阶段时，这种合作伙伴的数量进一步减少。这随后减少了有关应用改进的输入——使得参与者和相应交易数目更易管理，但也趋向于简化测试。原计划在建筑项目的后期阶段进行额外的测试迭代，但这无法实现。此外，由于COVID-19大流行的限制，准备阶段的访谈和后续评估访谈是通过虚拟通讯工具进行的。以这种方式生成的实证材料被解释为足以达到研究目标——但我们认为，如果我们能够在准备工作和测试期间进行现场工作，将会产生更强大的研究材料。另外，应该注意，概念开发、原型和测试都聚焦于物流环节，直到在现场大门交货，而施工现场内部的流程并未得到优先考虑。最后，BLogCHAIN成为一个独立的系统，在已建立的工作实践的同时进行了测试。这限制了测试结果，因为与订购/会计系统（及其流程）的更紧密整合可能会加强测试参与者对区块链潜力的理解。
- en: Recommendations for future work include further sociomaterial field studies,
    the further updating of BLogCHAIN, and the testing of the latter in at least one
    construction site. This can be tied with a focus on horizontal integration in
    the logistics processes, thus tackling logistics processes within the site itself.
    Furthermore, a major proposal for future improvements has to do with the system
    checking the clients’ creditworthiness on behalf of the suppliers.
