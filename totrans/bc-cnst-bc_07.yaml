- en: The economic, information and material flows in construction logistics are usually
    disintegrated—but blockchain could integrate them into a shared digital ledger
    supported by smart contracts, thus creating value for the relevant actors (e.g.
    contractors, suppliers). Therefore, we explore such a solution’s potential by
    conceptualizing, developing, implementing, and testing a relevant pilot in the
    Swedish context. Theoretically, we adopt sociomateriality, thus understanding
    blockchain as a digital facilitator of transactions, flow integration, social
    interactions, and trust development. Methodologically, we review the literature
    on blockchain for construction logistics, and report from our empirical studies
    in Sweden. The literature review showed that core blockchain properties can generate
    value for construction logistics (e.g. reduction of accounting rework)—however,
    there currently exist no use cases beyond concepts and pilots. Moreover, implementation
    can be challenging due to practical and security constraints—also reflected in
    our own empirical material. Regardless, the solution was conceptualized as a permissioned
    private proof-of-authority blockchain named BlogCHAIN, and developed into an online
    application based on Hyperledger Besu. Testing BLogCHAIN revealed that the practitioners’
    resistance and powerplay required a simplification of our initial concept. Indeed,
    the flows were integrated, more decentralization and transparency were achieved,
    and previously time-consuming processes were facilitated—but the main contractor
    retained control over critical logistics segments. Our lessons-learned showed
    that several issues can jeopardize the adoption of blockchain, like existing power
    balances and unrealistic hopes of transparency and accountability beyond established
    business practices. The solution could be integrated with the IoT and machine
    learning in the future.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The integration of flows within construction supply chains and logistics has
    long been identified as crucial for the optimization of logistics and the overall
    success of construction projects [[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2)]. The information, material,
    and financial flows have been identified in [[3](#CR3)], where the criticality
    of their integration for effective construction supply chain and logistics management
    had also been noted. The information flow can be understood as the bidirectional
    flow of prompts and requirements received and released by a construction supply
    chain partner [[3](#CR3)]; the material flow as the flow of physical assets, and
    the financial flow as the exchange of pecuniary assets while encompassing things
    like the operational cost [[3](#CR3), [4](#CR4)]. Other descriptions for the latter
    flow include ‘cash flow’ (i.e. cash transactions) [[5](#CR5), [6](#CR6)], and
    ‘money flow’ (i.e. monetary affairs) [[7](#CR7)]. More recently, it was considered
    that such descriptions of the latter flow only partially account for transactions
    integrating data on prices, billing, and invoices [[8](#CR8)]. Therefore, the
    term ‘economic flow’ was introduced in [[8](#CR8)], in order to complement the
    information and material flows. The flow disintegration was also noted in [[8](#CR8)],
    given that such flows can include material and service supplies, payments, accounting,
    and other tasks that are often treated second-handedly by site management, subcontractors,
    transporters, retailers, and suppliers. The economic flow is a source of disturbances
    and delays in construction, including partial, delayed, or even absent payments,
    cost of finance, long payment cycle, retention, disputes over payments, and security
    of payments [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It has been envisioned that a way to ameliorate the disintegration of the three
    flows is by integrating them in an event-driven way; such ‘events’ can include
    the issuing of invoices and payments to the associated actors (e.g. suppliers)
    via direct peer-to-peer information exchange after the successful completion of
    other ‘events’, such as the delivery of materials, correct on-site component placement,
    and completion of related work packages [[11](#CR11)]. However, the actual benefits,
    framework, appropriate technology, and implications of such an integration, have
    been explored in only a few studies (e.g. in [[8](#CR8)]), while the evaluation
    of a relevant solution’s live testing and user experience has not been adequately
    investigated yet.

- en: 'Given the aforementioned considerations, the research question for the current
    chapter is: What would a solution for construction logistics, in which the information,
    material and economic flows are integrated in an event-driven way via a suitable
    technology, be—and what results would come out of its conceptualization, development,
    implementation and testing in a context-conscious manner? We aim to answer this
    question by following the work in [[8](#CR8), [12](#CR12)–[14](#CR14)], and exploring
    the functionality and potential value of such a solution realized through blockchain.
    We report from our research in the Swedish context, where we conceptualized, developed,
    implemented, and tested a blockchain pilot (named *BLogCHAIN*—*Building Logistics
    blockCHAIN*) for digitalized construction logistics with integrated flows. We
    adopt the theory of sociomateriality, in order to understand blockchain as a digital
    facilitator of transactions and flow integration, and relate it to social interactions
    and the development of trust. Methodologically, we systematically review the literature
    on blockchain-related research for construction logistics, and report from two
    years of empirical studies in Sweden, including the results of implementing and
    testing BLogCHAIN on a large construction site.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sociomateriality is an approach that emphasizes the way technologies are co-shaped
    with practices (also applying to digital technologies) [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)].
    According to sociomateriality, the material and social aspects of digital technologies
    are inseparable and fused in practice [[16](#CR16)]. This is reflected in the
    agency of the actors while they are utilizing the digital technology, since actions
    are considered to cease being exclusively human properties but are rather performed
    through interactions between humans and non-humans [[17](#CR17)]. This sociomaterial
    co-shaping can affect the structure of an organization or a constellation of actors
    [[17](#CR17), [18](#CR18)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Important notions in understanding sociomateriality are entanglement and performativity
    [[16](#CR16)]. Entanglement implies that a technology’s material and social aspects
    are not merely realized as being progressively intertwined (which could foster
    an understanding that they initially exist separately), but actually understood
    as not having an independent, self-contained state [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16),
    [19](#CR19)]. Performativity alludes to a world getting reshaped through ongoing
    reconfigurations [[16](#CR16), [19](#CR19)]. Τhis position, posing that a technology’s
    performativity emerges through social practices, strongly contrasts with the more
    dominant one posing a world that is made up of self-standing entities of technology
    and actors with a priori properties [[15](#CR15), [16](#CR16)].

- en: Sociomaterial understandings of blockchain are relatively few, but have given
    particular insights. In detail, blockchain is intertwined with the social world
    in both its protocol and implementation levels [[20](#CR20)]. Thus, the stakeholders’
    actions and issues of governance are critical when it comes to the consensus mechanisms
    of the operation protocols (e.g. smart contracts, permission regulation, etc.),
    as well as the framing and constraints of the technology’s implementation [[20](#CR20)].
    This framing also shapes the way the actors in the blockchain constellation understand
    trust, information privacy, scalability, security, user behavior, disintermediation,
    and environmental sustainability [[20](#CR20)]. It can also lead to blockchains
    with different privacy settings [[20](#CR20)]. Furthermore, blockchain can facilitate
    a complex sociomaterial system among actors, by digitizing the value chain, integrating
    various flows, shifting routines and capabilities, and reconfiguring existing
    infrastructure [[18](#CR18)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Building on those sociomaterial insights, a sociomaterial definition of a blockchain
    solution for construction logistics with integrated flows was offered in [[8](#CR8)],
    as a permissioned private digital ledger for partially decentralized peer-to-peer
    information and economic transactions across a project-specific network/constellation
    of supply chain actors (e.g. clients, contractors, logistics consultants, and
    suppliers). This digital ledger is append-only, permanent, stored and accessed
    in a historical record updated through consensus, and shared across all network
    nodes reflecting the actors in the constellation [[8](#CR8)]. As a permissioned
    system, it features a reduced but existing need for in-between verification, security
    and settlement of transactions, and the consensus updates are based on proof-of-authority—where
    consensus features identity as a stake and is agreed between the authorized participants
    [[8](#CR8)]. In addition, it creates power shifts within the constellation, aligned
    with the sociomaterial autonomy-control paradox [[21](#CR21)]. The economic transactions
    are event-driven and event-inducing, i.e. they are triggered when certain events
    in the information flow (e.g. issuing purchasing orders) and/or the material flow
    (e.g. on-site material deliveries) take place, and can trigger other events (e.g.
    issuing invoices when transactions are completed); thus, the economic, material
    and information flows get integrated [[8](#CR8)].

    chains and logistics within Sweden was conceptualized in [[8](#CR8)] (see Fig. [1](#Fig1)).![](../images/504856_1_En_7_Chapter/504856_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.png)

    by independent logistics consultants (usually hired as third-party logistics facilitators
    by the clients), and the suppliers are interchangeable with the transporters and/or
    subcontractors (as is the case in many real projects) [[8](#CR8)]. The order placement,
    approval and renewal (economic + information flows) can be done directly through
    the blockchain system itself (e.g. with the storing of hashes of files pertaining
    to these transactions), and subsequently trigger the on-site transportation and
    delivery (economic + information + material flows). Finally, the successful on-site
    checks of the deliveries are stored as smart contracts (information + material
    flows), the issuing of invoices is event-triggered within smart contract clauses
    (economic + information + material flows), and the release of payments is predefined,
    again, through smart contracts (economic + information flows). As such, the solution
    is shown to simplify and integrate the flows, thus accelerating processes and
    countering delivery failures, imprecise data retrieval, delays, withheld payments,
    multiple ledger structures, and faulty intra-systemic data transfers [[8](#CR8)].

- en: Moreover, the setup’s transparency and traceability are enhanced through all
    the actors’ active involvement in the consensus checks of the smart contracts—even
    clients and the suppliers, who were more passive in a pre-blockchain setup [[8](#CR8)].
    By being actively involved in shaping all three flows, clients and suppliers can
    have a more detailed and transparent overview of the construction supply chain
    and logistics [[8](#CR8)]. Moreover, the independent logistics consultants actively
    help shape the flows by implementing the solution and fostering accountability
    through the consensus checks [[8](#CR8)]. However, it should also be noted that
    in line with the sociomaterial autonomy-control paradox [[21](#CR21)], the general
    contractor may lose a lot of their centralized power over the supply chain—as
    this power would be diffused, through the consensus checks and the automated processes
    of the blockchain, to the rest of the actors. On the other hand, blockchain solutions
    also risk getting too decentralized, leading to participants developing their
    own variants (‘forks’) [[22](#CR22)].

    actors (i.e. suppliers and the contractor’s operatives and site managers) willing
    to test our prospective prototype there. Seven semi-structured interviews were
    carried out in September 2020 and provided material on the supply chain and logistics
    work practices in that specific context (e.g. the existence of other IT solutions,

    the last round of the preliminary interviews was finished. In the second development
    iteration (in January 2021, before the second field testing iteration), evaluation
    results after the first field testing iteration were considered. As such, three
    improvements were introduced in the subsequent development: the conditional re-involvement

    the different roles of sales managers and invoice issuers within the same supplier

    development round. When the first test round was planned for August 2020, it was
    hoped that we could conduct on-site introductory training, observations, and interviews.
    However, all of these were carried out online through Microsoft Teams, due to
    COVID-19-related restrictions that were still ongoing as of the second half of
    2020 and the first half of 2021\. In the first field testing iteration, a series
    of meetings were conducted with the testers over the span of two weeks, in order
    to guide them through the installation, functionality and interface of BLogCHAIN.
    Afterward, the tests took place through the rest of November and December, having
    designated the end-of-year vacation period as the stopping point of the tests.
    The tests consisted of the collaborating suppliers and contractor’s operatives
    carrying out logistics transactions through BLogCHAIN. In order to not disturb
    the everyday work, we agreed with the testers that the implementation of BLogCHAIN
    would run in parallel to the established way in which the supply chain transactions
    were already made—and not in replacement of those practices. During the tests,
    we conducted semi-structured interviews with the testers and engaged in observations
    as they used the application. The feedback after the first field testing iteration
    was received through semi-structured interviews with all the testers, in order
    to record their user experiences. This amounted to four interviews with supplier
    representatives and one group interview with four of the contractor’s site managers,

    technology within several fields of the construction industry (see, e.g. in [[29](#CR29)]),
    the current chapter is particularly interested in blockchain research for construction
    supply chains and logistics [[30](#CR30)]. Within that focus, it has been claimed
    that digital distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), which include blockchains,
    can mitigate the disorder caused by changes in the construction supply chain strategy,
    thus reducing the suppliers’ uneasiness due to withheld payments or other insolvencies
    [[31](#CR31)]. References [[11](#CR11), [32](#CR32), [33](#CR33)] posed that the
    information flow in downstream supply chain segments can be improved through the
    transparency and traceability brought by blockchain, and following [[33](#CR33)],
    an expert panel feasibility assessment of blockchain’s ability to mitigate payment
    issues was carried out in [[10](#CR10)]. The possible improvement of on-site logistics
    through the integration of blockchain with RFID sensor data was studied in [[34](#CR34)].
    The claim that transactions through a blockchain network can result in dynamic
    and instant payments for suppliers, transporters, and subcontractors, as well
    as better communication with the main contractor, was made in [[35](#CR35)]; however,
    in [[10](#CR10)] there is more caution in the evaluation of possible improvements
    of payment practices, which on the other hand do point to the potential of shorter
    payment times (even if not instant). Moreover, the visibility of the complete
    transactional history across the supply chain, as well as the consensus requirement
    for the block updates, are positively noted for possibly tackling the tampering
    with past logistics data [[35](#CR35)], and productivity and efficiency issues
    [[36](#CR36), [37](#CR37)]. Furthermore, blockchain is envisioned to reduce administrative
    rework (e.g. matching data among different supplier ledgers for multiple deliveries)
    and data errors and outages across the supply chain, thus leading to time and
    cost savings, better change management, better planning, and quick (even instant)
    delivery notice for the contractors [[35](#CR35)]. Accordingly, three key legal
    issues were identified in the potential of a relevant implementation: the restricted
    use of smart contracts to prescribed outcomes, the shared data access and ownership,
    and multi-jurisdiction concerns related to governing regulations and laws [[38](#CR38)].
    The utility of blockchain in making data transactions transparent and immutable
    in order to estimate the embodied carbon emissions along construction supply chains,
    was explored in [[39](#CR39)]. To accommodate blockchain, construction supply
    chains and logistics would require the conceptualization and development of operational
    processes that align with the roles and responsibilities of the supply chain actors
    [[40](#CR40)]. This alignment involves tackling issues of data tracking and contracting
    and transferring resources—thus mitigating the opportunistic behaviors of supply
    chain actors and shifting the trust from relational to system- and cognition-based
    [[41](#CR41)]. Furthermore, it has been shown that crypto-assets [[42](#CR42)]
    and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) [[43](#CR43)] can enhance both the granularity
    and the atomicity of the integration between the ‘cash’ and ‘product’ flows in
    construction supply chains. In a relevant vein, three blockchain-based models
    were developed, namely project bank accounts for payments, reverse auction-based
    tendering for bidding, and asset tokenization for project financing; the need
    to upscale the legacy IT systems and facilitate regulatory compliance, was highlighted
    [[44](#CR44)]. Finally, while in [[30](#CR30)] blockchain is envisioned to streamline
    a ‘green lean’ construction supply chain, [[45](#CR45)] elaborates on turning
    construction resources (e.g. materials, components) into smart construction objects
    by infusing their properties with a ‘smart’ layer of awareness, communicativeness,
    and autonomy, and then using those as blockchain oracles in construction supply
    chain management. In this context, an oracle is understood as a middleware capturing,
    validating, and then feeding information into a smart contract [[45](#CR45)].'

    and then [[8](#CR8)] have gradually investigated the integration of the material,
    economic and information flows along the supply chain, through a blockchain solution
    forming part of the value proposition in independent logistic consultants’ business
    models. In particular, [[12](#CR12)] investigated the suitability of Swedish construction
    supply chains and logistics for accommodating a blockchain solution integrating
    the logistics flows, by involving independent logistics consultants that can incorporate
    such a solution in their digital business model; the study then proceeded with
    a preliminary mapping of such consultancies operating in Sweden. The perspective
    of sociomateriality in relation to a potential blockchain solution for integrated
    logistics flows, and the power shifts that such a solution would bring in constellations
    of supply chain actors in the Swedish context, were introduced in [[13](#CR13)].
    These constellations included the typical case of large contractors internalizing
    logistics services, the atypical case of using independent logistics consultants,
    and the emergent case of third-party actors offering dedicated digital building
    logistics services [[13](#CR13)]. Moreover, sociomateriality was used to map potential
    benefits and threats related to blockchain visions and prototypes for construction
    (documented mainly in industry reports), and discuss the way those can be extrapolated
    to a solution for integrated supply chain and logistics flows in the Swedish context
    [[14](#CR14)]. Finally, a sociomaterial conceptualization of such a solution was
    offered in [[8](#CR8)], where the ways a generic logistics setup can be transformed,
    were mapped; then, it was planted in a conceptual digital business model canvas
    for independent logistics consultants, and the canvas was customized on the business
    case of a specific firm (with the input of the company’s representatives themselves)

    of the transformation of work practices that could be realized through the implementation
    of a blockchain solution and bring attention to the issue of flow integration.
    However, while their context-specific approach can be considered methodologically
    strong due to taking institutional particularities into account, it also makes
    their conceptualizations (especially in [[8](#CR8)]) vulnerable to any departure
    from that particular context.

    final developmental steps and then evaluation of the current study, showing the
    evolution of the undertaken research beyond the aforementioned references and
    into the material presented only in this current chapter. In particular, such
    a vulnerability materialized in the empirical part of our research, since the
    absence and/or inactivity of certain supply chain actors initially considered
    in the conceptualized solution (the logistics consultants and clients, respectively),
    forced the development and testing of a proof-of-concept that was reduced in comparison
    to the initial vision.

    of blockchain in construction logistics, were explicitly considered only in [[8](#CR8),
    [14](#CR14), [36](#CR36)]. Interestingly, all of these studies looked into blockchain-related
    research outside construction to formulate their argumentation. Regarding implementation
    constraints, these studies collectively posed that for supply chains and logistics,
    blockchain should only be adopted if it leads to the achievement of strategic
    objectives (e.g. reduction of rework), and that there are strategic factors that
    can impede blockchain’s adoption, including a limited engagement with the technology
    and a limited context awareness. Considering security, these studies highlight
    two common denominators. The first is a presumptive mistrust of the potential
    of blockchain as a viable technological investment. The second is an anticipated
    abuse of the properties of blockchain; the anonymity of the distributed node network
    could lead to illicit activities, the use of cryptocurrencies to losing grasp
    of the value of fiat currencies, and the inflexibility of transactions through
    smart contracts to potentially emerging tensions among the actors in the blockchain
    network.

- en: The findings from our preparatory interviews at the elected test site showed
    that the development of our application would have to depart from the concept
    in Fig. [1](#Fig1), and lead to a simplified and/or altered proof-of-concept (see
    also ‘Method’). Specifically, the only actors enacting transactions, as well as
    participating in the consensus checks, would be the contractor’s site managers,
    the suppliers’ sales representatives, and (conditionally) the transporters. The
    design of the prototype was updated to reflect that the stream of the material,
    economic and information flows on which it was to be implemented and attempt the
    flow integration, would start when the supplier issued the confirmation of the
    order already placed by the contractor, and finish with the contractor accepting
    (or not) the supplier’s invoice (issued after the material delivery had taken
    place). As such, the new concept, used for the first development iteration of
    BLogCHAIN, is summarily depicted in Fig. [2](#Fig2).![](../images/504856_1_En_7_Chapter/504856_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.png)

    the process but does not prevent the next step from initiating. The clauses were
    deemed mandatory or optional according to the overall interpretation of the interviewees’

    to a setup where, within the proof-of-authority algorithm, the consensus checks
    were to be replaced by checks performed by the contractor, and the transporters

    infrastructure of BLogCHAIN utilizes the open-source Hyperledger Besu framework,
    and can be accessed through MetaMask, a crypto-wallet and gateway to blockchain
    applications. MetaMask functions as an extension for Google Chrome, and can also
    be downloaded as an app in Google Play and the App Store (for smartphones, and
    iPhones, respectively). The files to be uploaded to the online repository connected
    to BLogCHAIN (e.g. invoices) should be in PDF format, and they are encrypted in
    Microsoft Azure. As BLogCHAIN constitutes a private permissioned blockchain that
    is eligible for access only through an actively permitted MetaMask account, the

    checks were conducted on the stability and utility of the alpha version. The developers
    created dummy contractor, supplier and transporter accounts and conducted test
    transactions. This process lasted for about a week, in which various minor bugs
    and UI issues were tackled. Afterward, a series of remote meetings were held with
    the actual testers, in order to introduce and train them in installing and using
    the application. In some cases, short subsequent meetings were held for clarifications.

    the contractor and two out of the three suppliers that were contacted. One supplier
    was responsible for delivering concrete and aggregates of a varying granulometric
    gradation, and the other delivering an assortment of lighter materials (primarily
    wood). These transactions were infrequent and spread during the testing period
    of late November and into December 2020\. As a result, only a handful of transactions
    were recorded on BLogCHAIN by the end of this testing period. This infrequency
    and sparseness had to do with the construction phase, which mostly entailed a
    few bulk deliveries of construction materials, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic
    crisis, which detained (to a certain degree) the supply chain and logistics processes.

    this supplier informed us that their company already deployed an automated digital
    system for handling the flows between them and the contractor (e.g. issuing invoices).
    This system was deemed by the supplier to be as optimized as needed for the company’s
    business model, and therefore the supplier declined participating in testing BLogCHAIN

    value creation, collaboration and work environment (including UI). By comparing

    featured both more suppliers and more transactions than the first round. In particular,
    four suppliers now acted as testers (compared to the two suppliers in the first
    testing iteration), who conducted, in total, more than double the transactions.
    The tests were conducted during the two middle weeks of February 2021\. The initial
    plan was to use only one week, but utilitarian issues forced some of the deliveries
    to be spread over a second week, so that was included in the testing period as
    well.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The feedback after the second testing iteration was acquired through one interview
    with each of the supplies, and one with the contractor’s site management representatives.
    Overall, the feedback consisted of mainly positive and constructive comments.
    With regard to the positive comments, it was mentioned that BLogCHAIN creates
    a clear connection between the supplier and the contractor, while the confirmation
    function in the app allows this connection to be documented and available for
    different roles in the supply chain (and not just individuals). Moreover, its
    ability to bring together and connect the supply chain actors was highlighted
    as an improvement, as ‘in current practices, e.g. e-mails between individuals,
    they cannot do the same thing, as the individual can disappear, and the information
    can disappear or get mixed up among different people, or it is even difficult
    to access/follow it up’ (according to one interviewee). It can possibly be understood
    that this comment mainly referred to the information flow. Furthermore, BLogCHAIN
    creates a ready-made platform where everyone can join, as ‘the key is that everyone
    in the industry must gather around a common interface’ (according to one interviewee).
    It was also noted that even though there might be no major problems with invoices
    and approvals today, planned meetings for clarifications (e.g. at the end of the
    month) were needed—and the app, through the overview it offers, could potentially
    reduce the need for such meetings. Finally, the app was praised for making it
    possible to quickly satisfy requests of finding and showing the right order confirmation—through
    BLogCHAIN, it is possible to quickly get details out of the purchase, and know
    exactly what the customer previously bought (and of which they now want to buy
    more, or on which they now want to make a complaint).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to the constructive comments, it should be mentioned that we were
    not given a really critical feedback. However, not all testers felt that any substantial
    value was generated for them by using BLogCHAIN. Specifically, one company shared
    that they are in the process of developing a system with similar functions, although
    not based on blockchain; it remains to be seen how another base technology can
    lead to ‘similar functions’. The benefits, costs and risks of handling payments
    via a common blockchain solution instead of the parties’ current systems, were
    considered to be not self-evident and impossible to calculate. The cost of internal
    administration at each party is not clear and there are probably more aspects
    that need to be highlighted. Another supplier declared that apart from a visible
    approval of the order confirmation, no major benefit was generated for them, as
    they already have a functioning system. The same company highlights that there
    are different issues depending on the material to be delivered, and therefore
    the app is too generic to be of real interest. However, the same company highlighted
    that they distrust the industry’s ability to adapt to new technologies (regardless
    of the type). This last comment can be interpreted as emanating mostly from a
    concern on the institutional aspects of the industry (‘slow to adapt’), rather
    than the app in itself.

    a lack of joint planning, a risk of parallel orders and other processes, and disorientation
    among actors active in the pursuit of integrating and defragmenting parallel material
    flows and logistics. The tests of the prototype showed the way a more integrated
    management of received goods can be done on-site, by using BLogCHAIN as a common
    tool. The tests also showed that stronger integration between, on the one hand,
    suppliers and their IT systems and, on the other hand, accountants and their ledger
    systems, is an attractive potential.

- en: Taking the reduction of transactions into account, the information and economic
    flows nowadays require constant checking by a series of professionals. These checks
    thus imply constant human intermediation. As such, disintermediation (i.e. reducing
    human intervention), has a large potential for generating a surplus for the involved
    companies [[20](#CR20), [46](#CR46)]. However, our tests did not directly show
    a realization of this potential. BLogCHAIN operated as a stand-alone application,
    and as such, it increased rather than decreased the needed intermediation. Moreover,
    the longer-term possibilities of overseeing, e.g., monthly transactions, have
    not been tested.

- en: 'Considering transparency, we characterize blockchain as a trust-based technology:
    it requires trust amongst the logistics actors but can also develop transparency-based
    trust. Public permissionless blockchains (such as the ones based on proof-of-work),
    do constitute open systems accessible to all. Such transparency is believed to
    be paired with the irreversibility of the conducted transactions, which is seen
    to assure that the system cannot be tampered with. However, BLogCHAIN is a permissioned
    system, only allowing actual members of the supply chain as users [[28](#CR28)].
    This type of limited trust, higher security and partial information privacy appears
    to have worked well in the tests and did not receive any negative comments. It
    actually seemed to have been taken for granted, as expected in blockchain applications
    [[28](#CR28)]. Nonetheless, if blockchain is supposed to support a more client-oriented
    constellation, then it is more suitable in an atypical (‘more egalitarian’) constellation,
    e.g. a partnering project where mutual trust (‘opening one’s books’) is declared.'

- en: For the dimension of value creation, we consider that presently, construction
    logistics are hampered by continuous tensions about deliveries and payments. In
    2019, Swedish companies paid their bills on an average of 33 days after receiving
    them [[44](#CR44)]—even if standard conditions clearly delimit this span to 28 days.
    Moreover, conscious late payment is viewed as accounting for 50% of the total
    payments. Therefore, the potential for agreeing on an automated payment is huge.
    The creditor can realize direct monetary advantages when receiving payment just
    3–5 days earlier than the present average practice, and the debtor can avoid constant
    attention to paying at a late time, thus reducing human intermediation. Moreover,
    one can imagine rebates and other services included in agreements for the purchaser
    [[9](#CR9), [49](#CR49)]. It should therefore be possible to create a joint value
    creation—a win–win situation—with smart contracts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In particular, smart contracts can support agreements specifying e.g. annual
    purchasing volumes, delivery, and quality conditions, and set prices. However,
    it is likely that the ability to deviate from the smart contracts at a later stage
    will be welcomed, as site managers are quite often able to negotiate better conditions
    than the initial (and by convention, immutable) clauses prescribed in a smart
    contract. In other words, there is a risk related to smart contracts, where they
    become a top-down instrument for management, to the detriment of the project constellation.
    As a case in point, we introduced optional checks as flexible clauses in BLogCHAIN.
    These were received well by the suppliers, but treated with some skepticism by
    the contractor’s site managers. However, it remains to be seen if such simple
    solutions can account for a larger-scale implementation, where numerous conflicting
    flows and hundreds of transactions might have to be performed simultaneously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, the results on the dimension of implementation show that while substantial
    time and resources were invested in the initial concept of BLogCHAIN, updates
    and remarks that came later were also important—as those latter updates were very
    specific to the context of the construction site that served as the testing ground.
    Even little conceptual and preparatory changes had a far-reaching effect on the
    development process itself. Moreover, a set of interesting insights regarding
    late invoice payments and their possible amelioration through blockchain, emerged
    from the final round of interviews. Specifically, it was discussed that there
    are different driving forces for those delays, such as the client having difficulties
    paying due to financial problems, consciously paying late (either to make capital
    gains, or due to uncertainties about the deal), and even withholding the entire
    payment in case of ambiguity of parts of the delivery. Suppliers tend to avoid
    clients with financial difficulties, but the issue of consciously paying late
    appears mainly in ‘serious’ clients. There is a consensus among suppliers and
    clients that both parties contribute to this situation and it is not the respective
    company's internal payment routines per se that are the problem. As no interviewed
    party had a clear picture of the cost of internal administration of complaints/disputes
    regarding invoices, the actual problems seem to arise during the validation of
    the received goods and getting the correct information in the invoice. As such,
    late payments by ‘serious’ customers seem to be largely due to deficiencies in
    the contractor's delivery receipt control, which are only discovered when it is
    the time for the contractors to administer the payment.

    itself, led to the choice of widely used and relatively standard development tools
    in the field of blockchain and smart contracts (i.e. Hyperledger Besu, MetaMask,
    and Microsoft Azure). The absence of more ‘exotic’ choices did not harm the development
    of BLogCHAIN, but rather the opposite—it facilitated a streamlined process, and
    a relatively simple, understandable functionality and UI in the prototype itself,
    which helped the testers grasp it quicker. Streamlining, quickness and ease were
    essential for the testers, as this meant fewer disruptions in their normal day-to-day
    tasks. Such a reduced disruption was also facilitated by running the tests in
    parallel to (and not replacing) the business-as-usual transactions, after a bilateral
    agreement with the testers.

    intertwined with changes in practices through implementation. In the current case,
    such an implementation encompassed preparatory interviews, introduction meetings
    when the prototype was ready for testing, and one-to-one sessions with each user
    setting up their account for BLogCHAIN. During the tests, a continuous online
    support was offered. The kickoff was a typical example of a common implementation
    process of digitalization—first-time users struggling with the basic function
    of the MetaMask shell and the entries in the blockchain itself. But these ‘early
    symptoms’ were overcome relatively quickly. A more thorough embedding would extend
    beyond the two testing periods, and a crucial moment for future adoption would
    be when the use of the system goes beyond a single case and becomes standard software
    for the central users.

    bring about a complex sociomaterial system among actors, by digitizing the value
    chain, integrating various flows, shifting routines and capabilities, and reconfiguring
    existing infrastructure [[18](#CR18)]. But this requires roughly at least five
    more years, as pointed out by Arup in their technology forecast for blockchain
    in the built environment [[49](#CR49), [50](#CR50)]. They predict that the period
    of 2023–2028 is needed for the emergence of a similar blockchain solution to the
    one described in this chapter.

    be integrated with the respective supplier’s own ledger system, so that the order
    confirmations and invoices can enter the app automatically. Expansions in its
    utility, like the coupling with a scanning function upon receipt of incoming goods,
    enacting payments (probably requiring cryptocurrencies), connecting the information
    in the app with future additional sales from, e.g. the end customer, and using
    it as an interface between the parties’ internal business systems for coherent
    information flows, were discussed. The future facilitation of partial invoice
    payments (e.g. when a defect is found in parts of the delivered goods), as well
    as regulating transactional disputes within the contractor firm itself, were suggested.
    Finally, a major proposal was the creation of an aftermarket case in the app;
    interestingly, to illustrate the need for this, a piece of the received feedback
    by an interviewee went thus: ‘If a part of the invoice is questioned, the supplier
    can accept or reject the complaint; the contractor can then withhold payment for
    the disputed part—but pay the rest of the invoice. Today it is common for the
    contractor to withhold the entire amount. To make things clearer, let’s say that
    a supplier delivers with a 30-day payment time. Receipt is approved. The material
    is assembled after 15 days, and after assembly a defect is found in the material.
    The contractor then withholds the entire invoice. It then becomes a dispute where
    the supplier must subsequently prove that the material now complained upon, was
    formerly received and approved by the contractor’.'

    core properties of blockchain, such as peer-to-peer transactions, record immutability
    and a degree of decentralization, are generally expected to generate the majority
    of the potential value-adding benefits—but few implementation experiences exist
    yet, as well as no actual business cases. Nonetheless, the associated research
    literature is growing quickly. However, this growth has to be coupled with more
    engagement with the technology within the construction supply chain and logistics
    context, and not only in regard to its functional aspects—but also its effect
    on work practices.

- en: The choice of sociomateriality as our theoretical framework reflects not only
    our considerations on the way blockchain, a general-purpose technology, can be
    properly contextualized within Swedish construction supply chain and logistics
    setups—but also our empirical understanding of the real-life function of such
    setups. Rather than viewing the respective actions as technical choices among
    rationally discernible operational models (which is recurrent in the approaches
    of operations management and business economics), we interpret them as different
    solutions involving characteristic distributions of power. This evidently means
    that the investigated operational framework is not limited to knowledge exchange
    [[51](#CR51)], but also constitutes a political game that is co-shaped along the
    utilized technological framework. Moreover, since large urban construction sites
    can suffer from theft and shrinkage in material supplies, at least internal trust
    among the actors in a (partially) decentralized blockchain network, should be
    cultivated. However, supporting an outright permissionless setup can be difficult.
    Thus, a permissioned private system (like BLogCHAIN) that can establish procedures
    to protect the blockchain network both from external threats and internal instabilities,
    is informed by existing sociomaterial conditions. Furthermore, deeply integrating
    the new technology evidently involves technical interoperability issues, as well
    as changes in the participating companies’ work practices, social setups and organizational
    structure. Our sociomaterial understanding (also reflected in the testing of BLogCHAIN)
    places the blockchain solution in parallel or on top of an information infrastructure
    consisting of different accounting, project planning, site planning, quality control,
    and access control systems; then, the adoption of common standards for the structuring
    of ledgers should ensue.

    but nonetheless demonstrated the utility of blockchain in four dimensions: increasing
    integration, facilitating the opportunity of a reduced number of transactions,
    increasing transparency, and creating opportunities for future value creation.
    The integration occurred among members of site management supporting transparent
    coordination. Deficiencies in coordination are known to create quality defects,
    and transparency can help in amending those (e.g. more precise information on
    truck deliveries can reduce waiting times and on-site work interruptions). The
    opportunity for reduced transactions relates to the order and accounting processes
    in the participating companies, where a common ledger can lead to less human intermediation—which
    is currently substantial, if not voluminous. The prototype also highlighted the
    possibility of a more active and digitally supported role of the clients, despite
    not having included a client node in the distributed digital ledger of the 1st
    iteration. Enabling the online surveillance of the logistics flows (especially
    the economic flow) can provide the client with valuable knowledge, which could
    otherwise have been mostly accessed by the contractor, or indirectly through independent
    logistics consultants.'

    surfaced. Some users (e.g. site managers) requested making blockchain transactions
    obligatory, while others (e.g. suppliers) preferred a more flexible solution maintaining
    some transactions as voluntary. This is a dilemma for future development; however,
    it can already be considered that to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks in the process,
    it is maybe advisable to keep most steps voluntary. Nonetheless, it is possible
    that in the future, blockchain can support standardized processes involving obligatory
    steps.

- en: System disintegration through APIs seems to be a major deficit in the operation
    of BLogCHAIN. Integration with other systems is crucial for the creation of value
    for the participating actors. Moreover, such value may be demarcated by the scope
    of this study; BLogCHAIN can be interpreted as positioning itself in a small niche,
    compared to the large number of articulated visions and prototypes of blockchain
    applications in the international construction context [[51](#CR51), [52](#CR52)].
    It can be argued that the present ongoing differentiation of the industry into
    niches can be instrumental for moving the development and application of blockchain
    closer to actual use. However, it may also imply that this general-purpose technology
    is dispersed into a number of dissimilar applications, where construction logistics
    is only just one—and not widely researched yet. Thus, it should also be recognized
    that blockchain is a general-purpose technology in need of contextualization—in
    other words, an empty shell with wide application possibilities that need to be
    developed before any value creation really materializes.

    relative lack of blockchain awareness, and the existing power balances within
    sociomaterial constellations. In the future, it would be interesting to also address
    the issues around payments. As mentioned above, if a blockchain- and smart contract-based
    solution can obtain payments just a few days quicker than the current practice,
    the business value potential is huge [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10), [50](#CR50)].

    logistics (in which the information, material and economic flows are integrated

- en: Our literature review on, specifically, blockchain for construction supply chains
    and logistics, delineates a number of benefits emanating from core blockchain
    properties (e.g. the reduction of administrative and accounting rework, and a
    more efficient payment practice); however, the studies reflect a maturity level
    no higher than that of prototypes, and no solutions implemented into actual use
    cases have been found. Moreover, few studies have adopted a sociomaterial lens
    considering a strong embedding in practices.

    blockchain-induced flow integration across a segment of downstream logistics,
    i.e. from the issuing of purchasing orders until the completion of the on-site
    deliveries. The envisaged benefits of the solution included (among others) the
    streamlining, integration and transparency of logistics processes, and value creation.
    However, certain issues (mostly tied to the wider construction context) have to
    be addressed, so that the realization of such value will not be hindered; such
    issues include, among others, data unavailability, a relative lack of wide blockchain
    awareness, and the existing power balances within sociomaterial constellations.

- en: The development, tests and evaluation of BLogCHAIN commenced with the prospective
    testers’ experiences informing the development process itself, the evolution of
    the pilot’s utility was informed by the way it was used during the tests, and
    the recommendations we got afterward were informed by the work practices in the
    supply chain and logistics constellation at the testing site. These have thus
    constituted a sociomaterial co-shaping of the digital technology with the related
    practices during testing, and with further implications for future implementation.
    Moreover, the sociomaterial approach considers the distribution of power within
    the logistics setup and leads to the understanding of mutual trust as a crucial
    issue in blockchain adoption. A permissioned private system can establish procedures
    to protect the blockchain network both from external and internal threats and/or
    abuse; in other words, supporting an outright permissionless system is here seen
    as an abstracted vision with little bearing. From a future perspective, integrating
    the new technology would change the work practices and social setups of the participating
    actors.

- en: The limitations of this study include the choice of a particular context in
    a specific construction logistics setup, for which the presented blockchain solution
    was developed. The main downside of this choice is that the same conceptualization
    cannot be easily replicated for other contexts unless new context-specific analyses
    are first conducted. Moreover, it was planned from the outset to interact with
    a limited set of suppliers and transporters. The amount of such partners was further
    reduced when focusing on an early phase of a building project that served as the
    testing ground. This subsequently reduced the input concerning improvements for
    the app—making the number of participants and corresponding transactions more
    manageable, but also tending to simplify the test. An additional test iteration
    in a later (and more complex) phase of the building project was originally planned,
    but this proved impossible to follow through. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19
    pandemic restrictions, the preparatory interviews and the follow-up evaluation
    interviews were carried out over virtual communication tools. The empirical material
    generated in this manner was interpreted as sufficient to fulfil the study’s goals—but
    we believe that had we been able to be on-site during the preparatory work and
    the tests, it would have generated stronger research material. Additionally, it
    should be noted that the conceptual development, the prototype, and the testing,
    came to be focused on the logistics segment until delivery at the site gate, whereas
    processes inside the construction site were not prioritized. Finally, BLogCHAIN
    emerged as a stand-alone system that was tested in parallel to established work
    practices. This limits the test results, as a tighter integration with the ordering/accounting
    systems (and the respective flows) might have strengthened the test participants’
    understanding of the blockchain’s potential.

- en: Recommendations for future work include further sociomaterial field studies,
    the further updating of BLogCHAIN, and the testing of the latter in at least one
    construction site. This can be tied with a focus on horizontal integration in
    the logistics processes, thus tackling logistics processes within the site itself.
    Furthermore, a major proposal for future improvements has to do with the system
    checking the clients’ creditworthiness on behalf of the suppliers.
