    What do libel suits look like when records can’t be deleted from the blockchain?
    What about the “right to be forgotten” that is built into privacy policy in some
    countries? In the case of sexual harassment, these aren’t just questions of protecting
    the accused. What if a victim comes to regret making a statement publicly and
    wants to withdraw it, perhaps to protect their privacy or even their safety?

    an organization that notarizes documents, like a government agency, an accounting

    It can provide unbanked people with digital wallets, prevent fraud, and replace
    outdated systems with more efficient ones. But we still need this new and improved
    world to be one that we want to live in. The largest cryptocurrencies—bitcoin,
    bitcoin cash, and Ethereum—require vast amounts of energy consumption to function.
    In 2017, blockchain used more power than 159 individual nations including Uruguay,

    “mining” is at the heart of the problem. When bitcoin was first conceived nearly
    a decade ago, it was a niche fascination for a few hundred hobbyists, or “miners.”
    Because bitcoin has no bank to regulate it, miners used their computers to verify
    transactions by solving cryptographic problems, similar to complex math problems.
    Then, they combined the verified transactions into “blocks” and added them to
    the blockchain (a public record of all the transactions) to document them—all
    this, in return for a small sum of bitcoin. But where a single bitcoin once sold
    for less than a penny on the open market, it now sells for nearly $7,000, and
    around 200,000 bitcoin transactions occur every day. With these numbers increasing,
    so has the incentive to create cryptocurrency “mines”—server farms now spread
    across the world, often massive. Imagine the amount of energy consumed by 25,000
    machines calculating math problems 24 hours a day.

    a meaningful platform for enterprise. The high energy costs are baked into the

    problem solving known as “proof of work” to operate, many newer blockchains use
    “proof-of-stake” (PoS) systems that rely on market incentives. Server owners on
    PoS systems are called “validators”—not “miners.” They put down a deposit, or
    “stake,” a large amount of cryptocurrency, in exchange for the right to add blocks
    to the blockchain. In proof-of-work systems, miners compete with each other to
    see who can solve problems the fastest in exchange for a reward, taking up a large
    amount of energy. But in PoS systems, validators are chosen by an algorithm that
    takes their stake into account. Removing the element of competition saves energy
    and allows each machine in a PoS system to work on one problem at a time, as opposed
    to a proof-of-work system, in which a plethora of machines are rushing to solve
    the same problem. Additionally, if a validator fails to behave honestly, they
    may be removed from the network—which helps keep PoS systems accurate.

    operates somewhat like a representative democracy. In DPoS systems, everyone who
    has cryptocurrency tokens can vote on which servers become block producers and
    manage the blockchain as a whole. However, there is one downside. DPoS is somewhat
    less censorship resistant than proof-of-work systems. Because it only has 21 block
    producers, in theory, the network could be brought to a stop by simultaneous subpoenas
    or cease and desist orders, making it more vulnerable to the thousands upon thousands
    of nodes on Ethereum. But DPoS has proven to be vastly faster at processing transactions
    while using less energy, and that’s a trade-off we in the industry should be willing
    to make.

    to PoS, and we should take more collective action to hasten this movement. Developers
    need to think long and hard before creating new proof-of-work blockchains, because
    the more successful they become, the worse the ecological impact they may have.
    Imagine if car companies had been wise enough, several decades ago, to come together
    and set emission standards for themselves. It would have helped cultivate a healthier
    planet—and preempted billions of dollars in costs when those standards were finally
    imposed on them. The blockchain industry is now at a similar inflection point.
    The question is whether we’ll be wiser than the world-changing industries that
    came before us.
