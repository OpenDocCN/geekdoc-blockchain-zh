    traditional banking business models. Building on the Business Model Canvas framework
    developed by Osterwalder and Pigneur (Business model generation: A handbook for
    visionaries, game changers, and challengers. John Wiley & Sons, 2010), this chapter
    outlines how blockchain technology can affect all elements of a bank’s business
    model and lead to new business models in banking. Moreover, the chapter provides
    an overview of the current status of banks’ adoption of the technology and highlights
    their approach to handling the challenges of blockchain.'

    delivers and captures value (Osterwalder and Pigneur [2010](#CR29); Zott and Amit
    [2010](#CR36); Teece [2018](#CR35)), changes and adapts over time in line with
    the market conditions. Among several factors, technological progress has been
    largely acknowledged as one of the main sources of change in organisations’ business

    adapting to new technologies and new types of competitors and solutions arising
    in the space, undermines the traditional schemes used by intermediaries offering
    financial services (Kobler et al. [2016](#CR18); EBA [2018](#CR9); Bank of Italy
    [2020](#CR6)). On the one hand, significant changes in consumer expectations and
    behaviours are pushing to reconfigure the bank–customer relationship model. Immediacy,
    simplicity and accessibility needs guide the choices for purchasing and using
    banking services and focus the attention of banks’ customers on a better-quality
    and more customised offer. On the other hand, new technologies are allowing many
    new players to enter the market, including non-financial service providers and
    fintech start-ups, which are offering financial services with much lower costs
    and a better user experience than traditional intermediaries. As a result, competition
    is increasing, which makes it ever more important for banks to satisfy new customer
    needs.

    banks to substantially rethink their business models and strategies in order to
    cope with these developments. The rise in blockchain’s distributed ledger technology

    has been widely acknowledged as a key source of future financial system innovation
    (McKinsey [2016](#CR24); Iansiti and Lakhani [2017](#CR14); Philippon [2016](#CR30);

    as a description of “the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and
    captures value” (Osterwalder and Pigneur [2010](#CR29), p. 14), represents the
    elements of a company’s business model, as well as their potential interconnections
    and impact on value creation. It consists of nine interconnected building blocks
    covering the four main areas of a business: offer, customers, infrastructure and
    financial viability (Osterwalder and Pigneur [2002](#CR28)). These building blocks,

    banks to provide their services and products in a faster, low-cost and secure
    way, thereby improving customers’ experience. The trade finance transaction made
    in 2018 between HSBC and ING Bank supports this argument: the two banks completed
    the world’s first commercially viable trade finance transaction in a record time

    Having access to a range of information recorded in the ledger (i.e. information
    not only of their customers but also of other organisations such as ships, ports
    and insurance), banks can exploit this information to have a better and more complete
    understanding of the behaviours, needs and preferences of their customers. This,

    billion financially excluded individuals worldwide (i.e. unbanked and underbanked
    populations), for whom blockchain can make banking more accessible. Through blockchain,
    banks can reach these excluded populations by solving most of the challenges they
    face when trying to access financial services (e.g. problems linked to KYC processes)
    and providing banking product and services tailored to their needs (e.g. by offering
    new financial alternatives, like cryptocurrencies, at an affordable price). Studies

    to better understanding their customers’ needs, exploiting these data can help
    banks to provide new products and personalised services with higher value added.
    Accordingly, activities like *data analytics* and *research & development* will
    be key enablers of the new value proposition. Banks will have to invest more in
    such activities, which are crucial for developing new products—not necessarily

    technology-based projects creates an ever greater demand for technology talent
    at a pace that outweighs the supply. Banks need to find ways to attract and retain
    such key personnel. Activities involving human resources, such as *recruitment*
    and *training*, will also be crucial for banks in this new context to facilitate
    the implementation of innovative business models. Banks will have to focus on
    skills and expertise (e.g. blockchain experts, data analytics, etc.) that are
    different from those of traditional banking (e.g. banking and finance, risk management,
    etc.) and, more importantly, difficult to attract given the increasing competition.
    It will be also necessary to translate the skills of such professional figures
    in the financial field. Moreover, the existing workforce in banks needs to adapt

    of blockchain’s DLT on the traditional banking business model could be significant,
    with all elements of the Business Model Canvas significantly affected. Blockchain
    can allow banks to offer a new value proposition to their customers, extend their
    customer bases and improve the efficiency of internal processes, thereby generating
    significant benefits for the banks’ profitability.

    and experimenting with this technology. Investments include *studies* on blockchain
    to explore how to implement and leverage the technology, *proofs of concept* through
    which banks are experimenting with uses of the technology (albeit on a very small
    scale and in a controlled environment) and *pilots* in which the technology is
    used for real transactions, typically with a limited duration and number of participants
    (Mills et al. [2016](#CR25); Martino [2019](#CR22)). The banks have taken different
    approaches (Mills et al. [2016](#CR25); EBA [2018](#CR9)): many have organised
    dedicated teams internally to study and experiment with the technology and/or
    established innovation labs to understand its potential costs and benefits, while
    others are collaborating with or investing directly in fintech start-ups to access
    the technology. At the same time, several banks are also participating in blockchain
    consortia/alliances (e.g. R3 and Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) in which several
    banks, as well as other stakeholders, work together to explore the potential benefits
    of blockchain and test solutions—in cooperation instead of in silos—to mutualise
    the costs and risks associated with the development of blockchain arrangements.'

    however, the technology is still in the development phase (J.P. Morgan [2018](#CR15)).
    For instance, in the EU context, the European Banking Authority’s ([2019](#CR10))
    risk assessment report on the European banking system shows that, in 2019, only
    26% of the sample^([1](#Fn1)) analysed was using blockchain’s distributed ledger,
    while the majority of banks (39%) were in the “pilot testing” or “in development”
    stages, as shown in Fig. [4.2](#Fig2).![../images/490216_1_En_4_Chapter/490216_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/490216_1_En_4_Chapter/490216_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.png)

    DLT affects traditional banking business models. Recent evidence (EBA [2018](#CR9);
    Bank of Italy [2019](#CR5); Rajnak and Puschmann [2020](#CR31)) suggests that
    banks’ investments in new technologies, including blockchain’s DLT, have different
    objectives. In some cases, investments aim to improve existing business models
    by making processes and functions more efficient: by employing new technologies,
    the banks are working to digitalise and optimise operations, reduce their own
    operating costs and enhance efficiency gains. In other cases, the aim of investing
    is to entirely reshape business models or develop new ones. The ultimate goal
    of these projects is to satisfy changing customer demands and find new streams
    of revenue. This implies developing a new value proposition, serving new market
    segments and developing new ways to interact with customers in order to enhance
    the customer experience.'

    including regulatory issues, technical hurdles (e.g. scalability) and technological
    standardisation. Thus, the extent to which blockchain can affect traditional banking
    business models will also depend on how such challenges will be addressed. In
    this regard, as I will discuss in Chapter [5](490216_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml), it
    is worth pointing out that regulators and authorities around the world are actively
    working to promote the development of the technology within the existing regulatory
    framework, while banks are collaborating with each other and with other stakeholders
    (governments, regulators, universities, etc.) to develop common base standards
    that will allow interoperability across the different DLT arrangements necessary
    to facilitate the broad adoption of blockchain by banks.

    elements have been changed and a novel logic of how a company creates, delivers
    and captures value has been launched (Lindgardt et al. [2009](#CR20); Amit and
    Zott [2012](#CR4); Loebbecke and Picot [2015](#CR21); Foss and Saebi [2017](#CR12)),
    the results of the analysis suggest that blockchain’s potential impact on banks’
    business model could be broad; all the elements of the business models (i.e. how
    banks generate profits, which customers they serve and which distribution channels
    they use) can be significantly affected. The DLT of blockchain could allow banks
    to change how financial services are offered and, thus, improve their traditional
    competitive advantages. In particular, blockchain can help banks to offer a new
    value proposition to their customers, providing traditional products and services
    more efficiently and creating new ones, as well as extend their customer bases
    with significant benefits in terms of the banks’ profitability. In turn, this
    will compel banks to focus on new resources and activities and establish new partnerships
    to enable a new value proposition.

    Puschmann [2020](#CR31)), this study suggests that blockchain may lead to new
    business models in banking and a challenge to the status quo. Nevertheless, it
    is still difficult to assess how and to what extent blockchain can affect the
    traditional banking business model. Although the use of blockchain continues to
    spread, with numerous large banks investing in the technology, recent evidence
    shows that blockchain projects in banks are still in the development phase. Thus,
    the technology does not yet represent a key element in the banks’ strategy and
    is, for the time being, not affecting their business models. The next two to three
    years will be key to understanding its real impact on the banking industry.
