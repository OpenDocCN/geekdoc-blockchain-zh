- en: At its core, the blockchain is a technology that permanently records transactions
    in a way that cannot be later erased but can only be sequentially updated, in
    essence keeping a never-ending historical trail. This seemingly simple functional
    description has gargantuan implications. It is making us rethink the old ways
    of creating transactions, storing data, and moving assets, and that's only the
    beginning.

  zh: 在本质上，区块链是一种永久记录交易的技术，这种记录不能被后来抹去，只能按顺序更新，从本质上保持一个永无止境的历史轨迹。这个看似简单的功能描述具有巨大的含义。它使我们重新思考创建交易、存储数据和移动资产的旧方式，而这只是开始。
- en: The blockchain cannot be described just as a revolution. It is a marching phenomenon,
    slowly advancing like a tsunami, and gradually enveloping everything along its
    way by the force of its progression. Plainly, it is the second significant overlay
    on top of the Internet, just as the Web was that first layer back in 1990\. That
    new layer is mostly about trust, so we could call it the *trust layer*.

    1990 年的万维网那样是第一层。这个新层次主要是关于信任，所以我们可能会称它为 *信任层*。

  zh: 区块链是巨大的变革催化剂，它们冲击着治理、生活方式、传统企业模型、社会和全球机构。区块链的渗透会遇到阻力，因为它是一种极端的变革。
- en: Blockchains defy old ideas that are locked in our minds for decades, if not
    centuries. Blockchains will challenge governance and centrally controlled ways
    of enforcing transactions. For example, why pay an escrow to clear a title insurance
    if the blockchain can automatically check it in an irrefutable way?

  zh: 区块链挑战了我们头脑中锁定了几十年的旧观念，如果不是几个世纪的话。区块链将挑战治理和中心控制交易的方式。例如，如果区块链可以自动检查，为什么还要支付托管来清结算保险呢？
- en: Blockchains loosen up trust, which has been in the hands of central institutions
    (e.g., banks, policy makers, clearinghouses, governments, large corporations),
    and allows it to evade these old control points. For example, what if counterparty
    validation can be done on the blockchain, instead of by a clearinghouse?

  zh: 区块链松绑了信任，这种信任一直掌握在中心机构（例如，银行、政策制定者、清算所、政府、大型企业）手中，并使其避开这些旧的控制点。例如，如果交易对手验证可以是在区块链上完成，而不是由清算所完成呢？
- en: An analogy would be when, in the 16th century, medieval guilds helped to maintain
    monopolies on certain crafts against outsiders, by controlling the printing of
    knowledge that would explain how to copy their work. They accomplished that type
    of censorship by being in cahoots with the Catholic Church and governments in
    most European countries that regulated and controlled printing by requiring licenses.
    That type of central control and monopoly didn't last too long, and soon enough,
    knowledge was free to travel after an explosion in printing. To think of printing
    knowledge as an illegal activity would be unfathomable today. We could think of
    the traditional holders of central trust as today's guilds, and we could question
    why they should continue holding that trust, if technology (the blockchain) performed
    that function as well or even better.

  zh: 一个类比是，在 16 世纪，中世纪的行会帮助维持某些工艺的垄断地位，反对外人，通过控制知识的印刷来解释如何复制他们的工作。他们通过与大多数欧洲国家的主要天主教教会和政府勾结，通过要求许可来规范和控制印刷来实现这种审查制度。这种中心控制和垄断并没有持续太久，印刷爆炸之后，知识很快就自由传播了。现在认为印刷知识是一种非法活动是不可想象的。我们可以认为传统中心信任的持有者是今天的行会，我们也可以质疑，如果技术（区块链）执行这个功能甚至更好，他们为什么要继续持有这种信任。

    the same way as medieval institutions were forced to cede control of printing.

- en: It is deceptive to view the blockchain primarily as a distributed ledger, because
    it represents only one of its many dimensions. It's like describing the Internet
    as a network only, or as just a publishing platform. These are necessary but not
    sufficient conditions or properties; blockchains are also greater than the sum
    of their parts.

  zh: 将区块链主要视为分布式账本是有欺骗性的，因为它只是其众多维度中的一个。这就像只将互联网描述为一个网络，或者只将其视为一个出版平台。这些是必要但不充分的条件或属性；区块链也大于其各部分的和。
- en: Blockchain proponents believe that trust should be free, and not in the hands
    of central forces that tax it, or control it in one form or another (e.g., fees,
    access rights, or permissions). They believe that trust can be and should be part
    of peer-to-peer relationships, facilitated by technology that can enforce it.
    Trust can be coded up, and it can be computed to be true or false by way of mathematically-backed
    certainty, that is enforced by powerful encryption to cement it. In essence, trust
    is replaced by cryptographic proofs, and trust is maintained by a network of trusted
    computers (honest nodes) that ensure its security, as contrasted with single entities
    who create overhead or unnecessary bureaucracy around it.

  zh: 区块链的支持者认为信任应该是自由的，不应该掌握在对其征税或以某种形式控制它的中心力量手中（例如，费用、访问权或权限）。他们认为信任可以是也可以是，并且应该是点对点关系的一部分，由可以执行它的技术来促进。信任可以通过编码实现，并且可以通过数学支持的确定性来计算其为真或假，并通过强大的加密来巩固它。本质上，信任被加密证明所取代，而信任是由一个信任的计算机网络（诚实节点）来维护其安全，这与创建
    overhead 或不必要官僚主义围绕它的单一实体形成对比。
- en: If blockchains are a new way to implement trusted transactions without trusted
    intermediaries, soon we'll end up with intermediary-less trust. Policy makers
    who regulated “trusted” institutions like banks will face a dilemma. How can you
    regulate something that is evaporating? They will need to update their old regulations.

- en: Intermediary-controlled trust came with some friction, but now, with the blockchain,
    we can have frictionless trust. So, when trust is “free” (even if it still needs
    to be earned), what happens next? Naturally, trust will follow the path of least
    resistance, and will become gradually decentralized towards the edges of the network.

    about replacing other intermediaries once again. But it's also about creating

    search a new class of services that will check blockchains to confirm the veracity
    of information. Information access will not be enough. We will also want to ask
