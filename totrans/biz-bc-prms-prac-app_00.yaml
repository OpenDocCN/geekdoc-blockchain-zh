- en: At its core, the blockchain is a technology that permanently records transactions
    in a way that cannot be later erased but can only be sequentially updated, in
    essence keeping a never-ending historical trail. This seemingly simple functional
    description has gargantuan implications. It is making us rethink the old ways
    of creating transactions, storing data, and moving assets, and that's only the
    beginning.

- en: The blockchain cannot be described just as a revolution. It is a marching phenomenon,
    slowly advancing like a tsunami, and gradually enveloping everything along its
    way by the force of its progression. Plainly, it is the second significant overlay
    on top of the Internet, just as the Web was that first layer back in 1990\. That
    new layer is mostly about trust, so we could call it the *trust layer*.

    life, traditional corporate models, society and global institutions. Blockchain
    infiltration will be met with resistance, because it is an extreme change.

- en: Blockchains defy old ideas that are locked in our minds for decades, if not
    centuries. Blockchains will challenge governance and centrally controlled ways
    of enforcing transactions. For example, why pay an escrow to clear a title insurance
    if the blockchain can automatically check it in an irrefutable way?

- en: Blockchains loosen up trust, which has been in the hands of central institutions
    (e.g., banks, policy makers, clearinghouses, governments, large corporations),
    and allows it to evade these old control points. For example, what if counterparty
    validation can be done on the blockchain, instead of by a clearinghouse?

- en: An analogy would be when, in the 16th century, medieval guilds helped to maintain
    monopolies on certain crafts against outsiders, by controlling the printing of
    knowledge that would explain how to copy their work. They accomplished that type
    of censorship by being in cahoots with the Catholic Church and governments in
    most European countries that regulated and controlled printing by requiring licenses.
    That type of central control and monopoly didn't last too long, and soon enough,
    knowledge was free to travel after an explosion in printing. To think of printing
    knowledge as an illegal activity would be unfathomable today. We could think of
    the traditional holders of central trust as today's guilds, and we could question
    why they should continue holding that trust, if technology (the blockchain) performed
    that function as well or even better.

    the same way as medieval institutions were forced to cede control of printing.

- en: It is deceptive to view the blockchain primarily as a distributed ledger, because
    it represents only one of its many dimensions. It's like describing the Internet
    as a network only, or as just a publishing platform. These are necessary but not
    sufficient conditions or properties; blockchains are also greater than the sum
    of their parts.

- en: Blockchain proponents believe that trust should be free, and not in the hands
    of central forces that tax it, or control it in one form or another (e.g., fees,
    access rights, or permissions). They believe that trust can be and should be part
    of peer-to-peer relationships, facilitated by technology that can enforce it.
    Trust can be coded up, and it can be computed to be true or false by way of mathematically-backed
    certainty, that is enforced by powerful encryption to cement it. In essence, trust
    is replaced by cryptographic proofs, and trust is maintained by a network of trusted
    computers (honest nodes) that ensure its security, as contrasted with single entities
    who create overhead or unnecessary bureaucracy around it.

- en: If blockchains are a new way to implement trusted transactions without trusted
    intermediaries, soon we'll end up with intermediary-less trust. Policy makers
    who regulated “trusted” institutions like banks will face a dilemma. How can you
    regulate something that is evaporating? They will need to update their old regulations.

- en: Intermediary-controlled trust came with some friction, but now, with the blockchain,
    we can have frictionless trust. So, when trust is “free” (even if it still needs
    to be earned), what happens next? Naturally, trust will follow the path of least
    resistance, and will become gradually decentralized towards the edges of the network.

- en: As back-end infrastructure, blockchains are metaphorically the ultimate, non-stop
    computers. Once launched, they never go down, because of the incredible amount
    of resiliency they offer. There is no single point of failure unlike how bank
    systems have gone down, cloud-based services have gone down, but bona fide blockchains
    keep computing.

    about replacing other intermediaries once again. But it's also about creating
    new ones. And so was the Web. Current intermediaries will need to figure out how
    their roles will be affected, while others are angling to take a piece of the
    new pie in the race to “decentralize everything.”

    mainframes, databases, networks, servers, software, operating systems, and programming
    languages. Since the early 1990s, the Internet ushered in another lexicon: browsing,
    website, Java, blogging, TCP/IP, SMTP, HTTP, URLs, and HTML. Today, the blockchain
    brings with it yet another new repertoire: consensus algorithms, smart contracts,
    distributed ledgers, oracles, digital wallets, and transaction blocks.'

    authenticity, rights, work done, titles, contracts, and other valuable asset-related
    processes. There will be digital ownership certificates for everything. Just like
    we cannot double spend digital money anymore (thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto's invention),
    we will not be able to double copy or forge official certificates once they are
    certified on a blockchain. That was a missing piece of the information revolution,
    which the blockchain fixes.

    package on the Web when FedEx introduced this capability for the first time in
    1994\. Today, we take that type of service for granted, but this particular feature
    was a watershed use case that demonstrated what we could do on the early Web.
    The underlying message was that a previously enclosed private service could become
    openly accessible by anyone with Internet access. A whole host of services followed:
    online banking, filing taxes, buying products, trading stocks, checking on orders,
    and many others. Just as we access services that search public databases, we will
    search a new class of services that will check blockchains to confirm the veracity
    of information. Information access will not be enough. We will also want to ask
    for truth access, and we will ask if modifications were made to particular records,
    expecting the utmost transparency from those who hold them. The blockchain promises
    to serve up and expose transparency in its rawest forms.'
