    IoT can be utilized for the outbreak prevention and its existing control systems.
    The authors have also explained how numerous edge computing devices (e.g., sensors/actuators,
    RFID systems, webcams, drones, etc.) are playing a key role in controlling this
    disease using IoT protocols like 6LoWPAN. In addition, the authors also emphasize
    IoT security attacks and vulnerabilities which are prevalent in the existing infrastructure
    setup of smart cities. The key aspects of emerging uses of IoT (such as smart
    retail store automation, smart transportation, smart waste management, etc.) are
    described that played a key role in controlling this epidemic in the existing
    infrastructure of sustainable smart cities. Finally, some future research directions
    are also discussed that highlight the steps in mitigating the effect of this pandemic
    using fog-enabled IoT and AI techniques.

    technology is the new driving force of different businesses and other applications.
    This information technology age has started producing enormous amount of data
    to be handled. According to the reports of International Data Corporation (IDC),
    the digital data as of now has almost crossed zettabytes in 2010\. On a daily
    basis, 2.5 zettabytes data is produced since 2011 (Yousef et.al., 2019). It is
    anticipated that in near future, by 2020, around 50 billion connected devices
    will generate new dataFor instance, IoT applications in healthcare showed data
    of 25k tuples were produced per second by 30 million users (Sarkar et al., 2015).

    way which has high power of processing, computing, storage capacity gained much
    prevalence (Yousef et.al., 2019). All data to be processed is sent to the centralized
    cloud & further analysis is done. Cloud computing is a centralized paradigm of
    computing model where all the steps of data pre-processing, post-processing is
    done in the cloud itself at a principal place. But due to multiplication of devices
    & its data generated the bandwidth is not considerate in satisfying the latency
    needs. The bandwidth factor has become a bottleneck in cloud computing (Kharrufa
    et al., 2019).

    like fog computing for addressing Covid-19 pandemic by controlling existing systems.
    The section of “Inception of Covid-19” states the augmentation of fog computing
    paradigm with the existing models for better identification & tracing of the virus.
    This chapter produces sufficient background as a knowledge base for establishing
    the concept of fog technology enabled IoT devices by reaffirming the relevance
    of fog Computing in Covid-19 & the abstract layers of the connection mechanism.

    1 highlights the timeline of corona virus. Then Europe witnessed the proliferation
    of the disease & announced its first case on Jan 07, 2020\. The sudden escalation
    led to deaths, the first death in China. Pneumonia affecting people & leading
    to death raised an alarm all over the world arising the situation of Global red
    alert & nations declaring national lockdowns in March 2020\. Even after lockdown
    more than 50k deaths were reported. The year 2020 was a mere spectator of the
    pandemic having no solution to this outbreak. In Jan 2021, medical science was
    able to administer few drugs to counter the virus with the introduction of vaccinations
    for Covid-19 all over the world (Rasheed et al, 2020).

    to address this problem of identification of cases by utilizing some existing
    technologies. The sudden outbreak of black fungus & white fungus has further fanned
    the flames of COVID-19 aggravating the pandemic situation to be more intensified.
    Indeed, there is a need for greater strides to make towards ameliorating the condition.
    Fog computing frameworks can be augmented to the cloud computing community for
    fast tracing of the cases. Mobile devices can be made as fog devices with tracing

    will be dominating the businesses around the world with new disruptive technologies
    like AI, FC with IoT, ML, blockchain etc. The strength of fog computing is best
    exhibited in distributing the computing power for faster access, retrieval, analysis
    of real time data for it to be analyzed & interpreted for masses in Covid-19\.
    It may help in speedy functioning of local places where connectivity & reachability
    is poor. As fog computing can be a cluster of devices having networking, processing
    & storage capabilities so these clusters can be installed in far-flung places.

    performs pre-processing tasks on the raw data. This way the overhead of cloud
    layer is reduced as it would save time & space of the cloud layer to handle the
    full burden of the data all together. After that, the processed data is transferred
    to the cloud. Subsequently the fog services transforms the processed data into
    relevant information. For instance, an application of health care services can
    alarm the patient when his/her sugar level rises above the threshold level & if
    his heartbeat is unusual. (Farahani et al., 2018).

    with their demands. uCode (ubiquitous codes) & EPC (electronic product codes)
    are the various methods which are used for identification. It is critical to address
    an IoT device in differentiating the address of its object ID. Here Object ID
    signifies a nomenclature. For e.g. Temp for a temperature sensor. Address of the
    object refers to the location which is within the communication network. There
    are various other methods of addressing like IPV4, IPV6 etc. It ascertains a mechanism
    for compression over IPv6 headers. This leads to a solution for low power wireless
    network which uses IPv6 addressing. There should be a significant difference between
    the address of the object & its identification, as the methods of identification
    are not unique globally. Therefore, addressing helps in identifying the objects
    uniquely. Hence network comprising of objects may use public IPs, & private ones
    are not used. We can conclude that the methods of identification can be a good
    base for providing a crisp identity for every object in the network (Letaief et
    al., 2019, Hu & Dhelim, 2017).

    It depends upon Representational State Transfer (REST) lying on functionalities
    of HTTP. CoAP was brought into existence by the IETF Constrained RESTful Environments
    (CoRE) working group (Kharrufa et al., 2019). Applications of IoT uses this protocol
    as an application layer protocol. REST has easier ways of communication established
    for exchange of data between server & client over HTTP. REST counts on stateless
    client-server architecture, also it is considered as a cacheable connection protocol.
    Social network & mobile applications use this architecture. It helps in eliminating
    ambiguity by using methods of HTTP like put, delete, get, post. XML is not needed
    by REST doesn''t require XML for exchanging messages. Differently from REST, by
    default CoAP is based on UDP (Welbourne et al., 2009).'

    that soon it will reach to the standards of market adoption. It will be able to
    support low-latency & time critical applications. Many firms & organizations like
    Open Fog Consortium i.e., Open Fog are important initiatives taken by Cisco, Microsoft,
    ARM, Intel, Princeton University, Dell etc (Mukherjee et al., 2018). In November,
    2015\. Some of the contributing members are Shanghai Tech University, Hitachi,
    Foxconn, ZTE & General Electric. Innovation Digital world is accelerated with
    the blend of wireless technology like IoT, 5G, embedded AI etc. These provide
    robust & prompt architectures with high interoperability.

    by enabling prompt responses, immediate data retrieval from the local nodes &
    even fast analysis in localized clusters without actually reaching to higher level
    of cloud (Lalmuanawma et al., 2020). We can create connected experiences by garnering
    data from distributed devices & analysing them. This will help in improving individual
    experiences. We can modernize the existing IT by having remote controlled infrastructure
    with technology of microcloud computing or fog computing. This will help in performing
    real time diagnosis enabling over the air updates to flow. This will also help
    in reducing the operational cost & facilitate faster services. However, some open
    issues still exist in this budding computing paradigm. In this section, we present
    some of future issues & challenges in research. Also, we attempt to view the future
    directions of this research (Tuli et al., 2020). Figure 22 depicts few relevant
    challenges of FC research. We list out issues as following:'

- en: OpenFog is referred to as N-tier environment in context of deployment (Kumar
    et al.,2020). But also, this fact should be addressed that introducing many levels
    in layers of fog computing would defeat the purpose of this new paradigm i.e.
    low latency (Swapnarekha et al., 2020). It may cause high delay in delivering
    services & responding to the end users. So based on the use case, number of layers
    to be involved can be decided. Decisions related to deployment can be taken based
    on factors like capability of the fog device, sensors count, amount of task, task
    type etc. Still, it is necessity to see to the fulfillment of these requirements.
    During deployment scaling of resources & application is vital.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The resources come from most diverse sources. This contributes in the variety
    of different hardware & manufacturers. Due to such heterogenous & dynamic resources
    in FC paradigm performance issues may arise. As an example, a system which depends
    on staff group o do some ordinary stuff like email or documenting some work can
    be a part of Fog & can also be made into a Fog device. This way we can conclude
    that fog resources are dynamic. Resource management or prediction is necessary
    as when the task undertaken by fog devices is over, the status may change as it
    may be set free for other application. Fog aims to utilize the resources which
    are idle. Therefore, resource allocation & management can be an incredibly challenging
    task (Gluhak et al., 2011).

    In fog, many devices are connected wirelessly & are in mobile clusters. So, their
    locations may also change frequently into some different clusters. Also, other
    crucial factor is since they operate on battery, so batteries may fail anytime
    which may again cause reliability issue. One other characteristic of these devices
    is that they are battery powered and might fail anytime. Hence, the complexity
    of failure management is a research issue.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Seamless interaction & uninterrupted communication & connection should be encouraged
    in an any network. Fog paradigm should ensure the same when communicating with
    the devices to meet the needs of time-critical applications. Applications which
    are time sensitive like surveillance of a health care unit or control of an autonomous
    car may be inflicted with great harm if connection failure occurs. Even if the
    centralized connection to cloud fails, the intermediate layers should be operational
    & should serve full time connectivity. Therefore, cross layer functionality &
    connectivity in cloud, IoT devices, Fog devices are delicate & crucial factors
    to be dealt with (Sheth et al, 2020).

    aspects. The heterogeneity of these devices gives birth to security & privacy
    issues (Goudarzi et al., 2020). These devices are administered by different operators.
    Users will be less interested to adopt this computing model if their privacy is
    compromised in any way. Therefore, security of the communication & privacy of
    the user is an extensive research issue in fog computing. As devices are decentralized,
    so accordingly the management of fog devices & monitoring should also be distributed
    in different clusters to ensure speedy & parallel operation of all small networks
    of fog.

    surveillance, tracking the contacts and maintaining the social distancing between
    individuals. The cloud layer is helpful in predicting the coronavirus. The technological
    advances are made in Cloud and fog layers (Bhattacharya et al., 2021). These technologies
    include Big data, ML, DL. They together mingle with IoT and provide solution more
    effectively to solve C-19 problems (Lopez et al; 2012).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We anticipate that FC will accelerate prompt responses & awareness amongst the
    nodes to exchange information. In emergency conditions like in this COVID-19 pandemic,
    it will efficiently manage the resources near to the smart wearables monitoring
    health & give processed data for further analysis in localized zones. Also, there
    would be less bandwidth issues by distributing the load among the fog nodes. Data
    of the patients is very sensitive, so it is easy for the fog computing to be able
    to monitor small personalized clusters. Ultimately, organizations that adopt fog
    computing gain deeper and faster insights, leading to increased business agility,
    higher service levels, and improved safety & seamless communication. The accuracy
    and precision of latency-sensitive applications and discovery of drug and vaccines
    related to this epidemic needs to be accomplished with fog computing as a part
    of future work, since this infrastructure platform works only on optimized bandwidth
    consumption and improving the latency.
