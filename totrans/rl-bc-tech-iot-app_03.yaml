- en: The Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth in a wide
    variety of use-cases in multiple application domains, such as healthcare, agriculture,
    smart cities, smart homes, supply chain, and so on. To harness its full potential,
    it must be based upon a resilient network architecture with strong support for
    security, privacy, and trust. Most of these issues still remain to be addressed
    carefully for the IoT systems. Blockchain technology has recently emerged as a
    breakthrough technology with the potential to deliver some valuable properties
    such as resiliency, support for integrity, anonymity, decentralization, and autonomous
    control. A number of blockchain platforms are proposed that may be suitable for
    different use-cases including IoT applications. In such, the possibility to integrate
    the IoT and blockchain technology is seen as a potential solution to address some
    crucial issues. However, to achieve this, there must be a clear understanding
    of the requirements of different IoT applications and the suitability of a blockchain
    platform for a particular application satisfying its underlying requirements.
    This chapter aims to achieve this goal by describing an evaluation framework which
    can be utilized to select a suitable blockchain platform for a given IoT application.

    a part of our daily life. In IoT, physical objects such as home appliances, vehicles,
    supply chain items, and infrastructure components can sense the environment around
    them and adaptively interact with each other in real time. Smart objects in IoT
    systems are usually heterogeneous in nature and work under different trust or
    administrative domains [[1]](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0010). Establishing trust
    and maintaining security in IoT domain is often regarded as one of the most challenging
    tasks. IoT devices depend on a variety of underlying network infrastructure which
    is vulnerable to attacks as evident in several recent cyber attacks [[2](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0015),[3]](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0020).
    In addition, security and privacy of the data in IoT networks is also a significant
    concern.

    because of its fascinating properties such as resiliency, support for integrity,
    anonymity, decentralization, and autonomous control. Although crypto-currency
    is the most widely used application of blockchain technology, the number of other
    practical applications beyond token-values is emerging. Over the past few years,
    the application domain of blockchain has expanded steadily, ranging from identity
    management, governance, IoT networks, financial services to healthcare. Among
    these applications, the convergence of blockchain and IoT networks holds enormous
    potentials in the area of IoT device identification, authentication, sensor data
    storage and seamless secure data transfer. The possibility of this convergence
    has driven the enthusiasm among the researchers, academia and industry practitioners
    to disrupt several IoT applications as well as to address the above mentioned
    issues prevailing in IoT systems.

    of blockchain platforms for different IoT applications such as supply chain, healthcare,
    smart city, smart home, financial services, automated smart contracts, and quality

    have different requirements. For example, requirements in smart cities are different
    to that of the wearable fitness tracking in healthcare or goods tracking system
    in supply chain management. It is often challenging to identify a suitable blockchain
    platform for a particular IoT application satisfying all its requirements. We
    believe that little work has been done investigating this aspect. To be more specific,
    there is a gap in this domain for an evaluation framework which could be utilized
    to select an appropriate blockchain platform for a given IoT application considering
    its specific requirements. In this chapter, we address this important issue. Indeed,
    our motivations are twofolds: (i) to formulate a comprehensive set of requirements
    for different categories of IoT applications and (ii) to develop an evaluation
    framework to verify the suitability of a given blockchain platform for a particular
    type of application according to its identified requirements.'

    as the world's first widely used crypto-currency and paved the way for a technological
    revolution. It is underpinned by a clever combination of existing crypto mechanisms,
    which is now called blockchain technology or distributed ledger technology, providing
    its solid technical foundation. In recent years, blockchain has received widespread
    attention among the industry, the government and academia. It is regarded as one
    of the fundamental technologies to revolutionize the landscapes of several application
    domains, by removing the need for a central trusted entity. At the centre of this
    technology is the blockchain itself which is a database consisting of consecutive
    blocks of transactions chained together following a strict set of rules. This
    database is then distributed and stored by the nodes in a peer-to-peer network
    where each new block of transactions is created and appended at a predefined interval
    in a decentralized fashion by means of a consensus algorithm. The consensus algorithm
    guarantees several data integrity related properties (discussed below) in the
    blockchain. The term blockchain is often synonymised with another term “Distributed
    Ledger.” However, we differentiate between these two terms in the sense that distributed
    ledger is a more generic term. A blockchain is just an example of a distributed
    ledger whereas there could be other types of distributed ledger.

    emerged which facilitates the deployment and execution of computer programs, known
    as smart-contracts, on top of the respective blockchain. Such smart-contracts
    enable the creation of so-called decentralized applications (DApps), which are
    autonomous programs operating without relying on any human intervention. Being
    part of the blockchain, smart-contracts and their executions become immutable
    and irreversible, a sought-after property having a wide-range of applications
    in different domains.

    modify the blockchain state by storing and updating data by means of transactions
    among participating entities. On the other hand, a private blockchain, also may
    be called as permissioned blockchain, will only allow authorized entities to join

    large number of devices are interconnected through the Internet, enabling them
    to send and receive data. It has been predicted that by 2019, 20% of all IoT deployments
    will be blockchain-enabled according to the IDC report [[10]](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0055).
    However, there are many technical hurdles that need to be overcome for successful
    blockchain and IoT integration. Today, over 5 billion IoT devices all around the
    world produce massive amount of geographic and demographic data and exchange them
    on the Internet. These data can be exploited and misused if an appropriate security
    measure has not been implemented to protect confidentiality, integrity and authenticity
    of data. Additionally, vulnerable connected devices such as surveillance cameras
    could also be used by the attackers to facilitate malicious activities. More precisely,
    each device in an IoT network is a potential point of failure and can be exploited
    to launch many cyber attacks such as botnets and Distributed Denial of Service
    (DDoS) attacks [[11]](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0060). There is no doubt that
    the use of blockchain to manage access to data from IoT devices may add an additional
    layer of security to the IoT networks as well as may overcome the single-point-of-failure
    problem. However, due to the lack of sufficient computing and communication power,
    it is a big challenge for IoT devices to directly participate in the blockchain
    network. Another key issue is that although blockchain is defined as the potential
    missing link between security and the IoT by many researchers, the technology
    is only as secure as its cryptographic mechanisms. Any human error in coupling
    this two emerging technologies will lead to security vulnerabilities.

    and IoT convergence has opened doors of opportunities for many applications such
    as supply chains and logistics. The inherent properties of blockchain and the
    self-execution capabilities of smart contract have fostered the potential large
    scale adoption of this technology to IoT applications where the interconnected
    devices are able to interact each other and make decisions without any human intervention.
    For example, machines running smart contracts will record details of all transactions
    that take place between themselves in a supply chain without any human oversight.
    Any erroneous event or actions/decision can be identified at the source and immediate
    corrective actions could be taken to reduce the impacts. Toward this aim, several

    records (EMR) more efficient, disintermediated, and secure. In addition to traditional
    information systems, IoT devices are also getting popular in health sectors. Health

    entities in silos rather than as parts of an integrated care system in most of
    the countries. In such systems, patient records are stored and maintained by different
    providers, making it difficult for the patients to access and share their own
    records. Also, health data is very private in nature and the patients often have
    to blindly trust the healthcare provider. The problem of data exchange and interoperability
    will be somewhat aggravated with the introduction of IoT into healthcare domains
    as it might be required to provide an interoperability support for such high-level
    of heterogeneous data sources. There have been several research efforts aiming
    to leverage the blockchain technology to tackle the aforementioned issues. Examples
    include MedRec from MIT [[14]](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0075) and others [[20](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0105)–[23](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0120)]

    smart city. This includes smart grid, smart water supply and their administration
    at both stakeholder and consumer end. The growing awareness in favor of using
    renewable energy at households and usage of the zero-emission electric vehicle
    for commuting introduce potentials for blockchain and IoT to play a crucial role
    together. For example, a blockchain-based utility sharing system would assist
    grids to decide how much production is necessary for a certain time of the day
    or to make decisions as to where to distribute water in the first place in the
    event of disruption or shortage. The same blockchain can be incorporated in a
    community-driven electricity sharing system where neighbors would provide electricity,
    generated using Solar PVs in their rooftops, to their neighbors in need and vice
    versa.

    applications of IoT. In essence, a smart home device must be equipped with IoT
    devices and sensors to function as desired. The underlying motivation of a smart
    home is that this will enable the home owners to have unparalleled control, remotely
    from anywhere in the world, over every single electronic device in their homes
    so that the overall comfort, convenience, and security can be increased in an
    energy efficient way. The desire and provision to exercise such control from anywhere
    in the world has fuelled the popularity of smart home concept. Indeed, there are
    already a number of smart home devices in the consumer market. With the introduction
    of different types of hardware and novel services, it is safe to assume that the
    market will continue to grow in future. This assumption can be backed with the
    prediction that the size of the world wide smart home market will be around 53
    billion USD by 2022 [[46]](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0235). Blockchain has the
    potential to add trust and traceability to the overall smart home concept and

    appliance will also be an IoT device in future, paving way for creating novel
    applications in order to provide a greater level of control and comfort for everyone
    at home. These will enable the residents of a smart home to monitor and control
    any home appliances remotely. A more futuristic scenario would be to establish
    M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communications between different smart appliances within
    the home to initiate autonomous behavior for facilitating daily chores. All these
    would require a resilient network that can support heterogeneous devices and facilitate
    autonomic code execution. A smart-contract supported blockchain can be a potential
    tool to enable this. It has been reported that Wallmart has investigated the possibility
    of integrating smart appliances using blockchain technology [[47]](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb0240).

    free and fast transactions and ability to validate unlimited number of transactions

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Tangle is a consensus-building system which removes the need for miners
    and data blocks on the platform. Each network member (machine) willing to execute
    a transaction must actively participate in the network consensus by approving
    two past transactions. This way each transaction links to the two transactions
    it verifies, and over time, it will be linked to future transactions that verify
    it. For each verification, the verifier performs a small work linking the transactions
    into the overall Tangle. This approach solves the scalability problem as the network
    no longer relies on building blocks for a blockchain. Since every new machine
    on the network contributes its computing power to the network when it submits
    a transaction, the cost of using the network is as good as the electricity consumed
    by the machine for verifying the required two transactions. The latest addition
    in IOTA is Qubic which is a protocol specifying IOTA's solution for quorum-based
    computations, outsourced computations and smart contracts [[55]](S0065245819300014.xhtml#bb9000).

    type of peers where their task is to endorse a transaction by checking whether
    they fulfill necessary and sufficient conditions. Orderer nodes provide communication
    channel to clients and peers over which messages containing transaction can be
    broadcast. Being a permissioned blockchain, it can support a considerable number
    of transactions. However, the number will be dependant on the use-case and how
    it is deployed. Fabric uses modular architectural design to support different
    consensus mechanisms to be plugged-in. Currently, Fabric supports only two consensus
    mechanisms, SOLO and Kafka, with more consensus mechanisms to be added in future.'

    functionalities, it is important to evaluate their applicability with respect
    to the identified requirements of the selected IoT applications. This core set
    of requirements are then analyzed to evaluate the suitability of different blockchain
    platforms for different IoT application scenarios. Our analysis has resulted in
    an evaluation framework which is presented in [Fig. 1](S0065245819300014.xhtml#f0010).

    is that all blockchain platforms embody the principle of accurate dissemination
    of information, in the form of transactions, among large nodes. In that sense,
    all such platforms support the notion of Scalability (requirement F1) and Reliability
    (F11) requirements. Hence, we have grouped them together within a same category
    in [Fig. 1](S0065245819300014.xhtml#f0010). Similarly, the second observation
    is that all blockchain platforms satisfy the notion of Data Sharing (F3) and other
    related requirements such as Multiple Sources (F2), Interoperability (F4) and
    External Interface (F8). Hence, these are grouped under the same category in [Fig.
    1](S0065245819300014.xhtml#f0010). Similarly, Transparency (F6) and Provenance
    have been grouped together under the same category in the figure. We have excluded
    Sloc and Moeco from this evaluation framework because of their lack of generality
    for our selected IoT applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At first, we describe how the evaluation framework ([Fig. 1](S0065245819300014.xhtml#f0010))
    serves the first purpose. It can be seen that five platforms, IOTA, OriginTrail,
    Waltonchain, IBM Watson and NetObjex, support scalability/reliability which is
    a key concern for IoT enabled blockchain applications. There are many applications
    that need to be implemented in a closed and private environment to provide privacy
    protection and Waltonchain, IBM Watson and NetObjex are the best choices for such
    applications. In addition to user identity, device identity is also very important
    for many application domains such as smart city and smart home. Not only this,
    these identities need to be properly verified. Only IBM Watson and NetObjex have
    the capability to support verified identity each IoT device and person in a network.
    It is not surprising that every platform supports data sharing since blockchain
    has already been established as a secure data sharing platform for its decentralized
    characteristic. With respect to the secure channel requirement, only IBM Watson
    allows users to explicitly define the HTTPS secure channel.

    city applications. For example, smart parking involves the payment system whereas
    traceability is important for effective management and distribution of resources.
    IOTA, OriginTrail, Waltonchain and NetObjex platform provide the payment services
    by using their native crypto-currencies. However, only OriginTrail and NetObjex
    platform are designed to trace the origin of a product since these two platforms
    are specially designed for supply chain applications.

- en: Next, the suitability of [Fig. 1](S0065245819300014.xhtml#f0010) for the second
    purpose is presented. The evaluation framework has been visualized in such a way
    that the color or the position of each platform can be utilized to evaluate a
    platform against a set of selection criteria of requirements for a specific application.
    For example, if a certain application requires to satisfy the scalability, support
    for private network, verified identity and traceability, NetObjex is the only
    platform that can support all these.

- en: Careful readers might notice the absence of an important requirement Performance
    (requirement F10) from the evaluation framework in [Fig. 1](S0065245819300014.xhtml#f0010).
    The performance is different than other requirements in the sense that it is normally
    quantitative in nature. In different contexts, it can be measured in different
    ways. In the scope of this chapter, we measure it using the transaction speed
    (TPS) property as TPS represents the most widely-used performance parameter in
    the blockchain community. With this characteristics, it becomes a bit less-intuitive
    to combine the Performance requirement with other requirements which are mainly
    qualitative in nature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'However, we propose to use the Performance requirement in a tie-break situation
    among several platforms. For example, if an application needs to support Scalability,
    Data Sharing capability with payment support, there are a few options to choose
    from: IOTA, OriginTrail, Waltonchain, and NetObjex. In such cases, we propose
    to use the Performance requirement (based on TPS) to select the best one from
    these. This mechanism also provides additional flexibilities. We can even consider
    different quantitative consensus characteristics as part of the Performance requirement
    to impose other quantitative selection criteria to select the best platform for
    an application.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IoT and blockchain are two emerging technologies that are expected to have immense
    impact in the society around the world. Each of these technologies has their own
    sets of applications and some significant shortcomings. Combining these two technologies,
    however, might address many of these shortcomings. Not only that, this combination
    opens up doors of opportunities for novel applications with additional advantages.
    This chapter aims to explore this avenue. In particular, this principal motivation
    of this chapter has been to create an evaluation framework which can be utilized
    to evaluate different blockchain platforms for their suitability in different
    IoT applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Towards this aim, this chapter has explored four different IoT applications:
    Healthcare, Supply chain, Smart city, and Smart home. For each of these applications,
    different use-cases have been analyzed. Based on this, several functional, security
    and privacy requirements have been identified. Next, seven IoT-focused blockchain
    platforms have been examined to identify their inherent properties. Finally, combining
    the requirements of the IoT applications and properties of the selected blockchain
    platforms, an evaluation framework has been created which is presented as a figure
    ([Fig. 1](S0065245819300014.xhtml#f0010)). The graphical representation provides
    an intuitive visualization to identify the suitable blockchain platform(s) for
    a particular application under certain requirements.'

- en: There are still a lot of challenges that need to be tackled before these two
    emerging technologies can be successfully merged. One major challenge will be
    to identify a suitable blockchain platform for a particular use-case (e.g., cold
    chain monitoring) within an application domain (e.g., supply chain). The current
    evaluation framework in this chapter has this limitation that it can only identify
    suitable platforms for a generic IoT application domain. We aim to address this
    in our future work. Even with this limitation, we believe our effort presented
    in this chapter will represent a step forward towards addressing this challenge
    effectively for researchers and practitioners in this domain.
