    of the most important compliance and operational areas within the cryptocurrency
    and digital asset spaces. As part of these discussions, we have focused on key
    operations and compliance considerations related to crypto asset managers. Within
    the crypto asset manager space in particular however, there are a wide array of
    other areas that we have not yet addressed but are still important to gain an
    understanding about. In this chapter, we will approach some other important topics
    beginning with an overview of crypto fund manager fees.

- en: Crypto Management and Performance Fees
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It should be noted that fund expenses are not the same thing as fund fees. The
    term, “fee” is typically reserved for a payment made not to a third-party service
    provider but to the fund manager or affiliated entity in return for performing
    services related to the management of the funds. The two most common fees are
    a management fee and a performance fee. A management fee is a fee that is earned
    by the fund manager regardless of the performance of the investments of the fund.
    This management fee is typically a flat fee that typically ranges from 1 to 2%
    but may be lower at the discretion of the fund manager. The purpose of the management
    fee is to provide the fund manager with capital to pay for management company
    expenses such as office space, personnel salaries, marketing, research, etc.,
    that would otherwise not be charged to the funds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The performance fee differs from the management fee in that it is directly related
    to the performance of the funds investments. In the hedge fund world historical
    performance fees may have been as high as 20%–30% however, may be lower depending
    on the fund managers discretion. Performance fees are sometimes called ***incentive
    fees*** or ***incentive allocations***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point the question could be raised as to why some managers are able
    to charge higher management and performance fees as compared to others. There
    are several reasons for this. Some managers simply have more demand for their
    funds among investors as compared to others. The reasons for this could include
    that a particular individual has a certain crypto investing pedigree with great
    success prior to launching the current fund. This success could have come at a
    previous firm and the manager has decided to now launch their own new fund. This
    is known as a ***spin-out***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, the fund manager could have launched a previously successful
    crypto fund at their own management company that is no longer accepting new capital.
    This is known as a ***closed fund***. The fund manager may now launch a subsequent
    fund that will accept new capital for a limited time. When the fund no longer
    accepts capital it is known as a ***fund closing***. In these types of cases,
    there may be more demand among investors to give the fund capital than they would
    like to take in. This is known as a ***capacity constraint***. Investors are often
    willing to pay higher management and performance fees in order to gain access
    to the desirable fund.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another example may be a fund manager who will be trading in a niche or newly
    developed marketplace in which many other fund managers are not actively participating.
    Investors may be willing to pay a fee premium for the specialized knowledge the
    fund has to invest in these markets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other cases, a crypto fund manager may not have much of a reputation in the
    market or only have previously managed a small amount of investor capital. In
    these cases, investors may feel there is increased risk associated with this manager.
    Furthermore, the lack of experience of the manager should not merit a fee premium
    but instead a discount. In these cases, management and performance fees on the
    lower end of the spectrum would likely be charged to compensate investors for
    the perceived additional risk factors associated with the fund manager.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, when a fund is describing their management and performance fee
    structure to investors, they typically will state them in a format with the management
    fee first and then the performance fee. For example, a crypto fund with a 1% management
    fee and a 20% performance fee would typically be referred to as being a “1 and
    20 fund.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To illustrate the way these fees are calculated in practice consider an investor
    who gives a crypto fund manager $100 to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum equally
    using the above referenced 1 and 20 fund fee structure. Let us further add that
    throughout the year the fund’s total investments rise in value to $220\. At the
    end of the year the management fee would be 1% of the $220 or $2.20\. The performance
    fee would be calculated based on the gain throughout the year which would be $120
    (i.e.- $220 - $100 = $120), and not the full year-end value (i.e.- $220). 20%
    of the $120 gain is $24\. In total therefore, the manager earned $26.20 from the
    combination of the management and performance fee. While this figure represents
    the gross profit for the manager, this is not likely what the fund manager will
    take home because the manager would have to subtract the aforementioned management
    company expenses from these figures. Once expenses are taken out the remainder
    would be the profit to the fund manager.

- en: Performance Fee Variations
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common variation with regard to the ways fees are charged relates to
    performance fees. In some instances, investors may with pursue a structure with
    a crypto fund manager who will only charge a performance fee after the fund reaches
    a certain level of profitability. This is known as a ***performance hurdle***,
    and the rate of profitability that must be achieved is known as a ***hurdle rate***.
    For example, let us assume that a fund grows 15% over the course of a year but
    is subject to a 4% hurdle rate. The performance fee would then only be charged
    to the 11% growth difference, as opposed to the entire 15% had a hurdle rate not
    been applied. Another variation to performance fees is a mechanism known as a
    ***high-water mark***. The presence of a high-water mark is to prevent a fund
    manager from earning a performance fee in the event the net asset value (NAV)
    of the fund does not exceed the previous period’s NAV. This protects investors
    from paying performance fees to poorly performing managers.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It should also be noted that not every investor in a crypto fund may necessarily
    pay the same performance fees. There may be different versions of shares, called
    share classes, that designate different rights and fees for different investors.
    The creation of these different share classes is in the discretion of the fund
    manager at the time of the creation of the fund. The fund manager may wish to
    create a ***founders share class*** for initial investors in the fund that would
    be subjected to lower fees. Another common variation would be for a manager to
    maintain a regular share class for those that meet the fund’s minimum subscription
    requirements, and a separate ***institutional share class*** for investors that
    opt to invest a larger amount of money into a crypto fund above a certain predetermined
    higher minimum.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It should also be noted that the previous example was a simplified one. In practice,
    a crypto fund may have a number of additional variations and complexities regarding
    the way fees are charged and their calculations. For example, in some instances
    a manager may opt to not charge any performance fee but instead only charge a
    management fee. The reasons for this could be that a manager is simply aggregating
    capital and passively managing exposure to a crypto index or indices. While this
    still could be considered active management of capital, the manager is in effective
    simply rebalancing assets under management to mirror indices. In these instances,
    many investors are only willing to pay a management fee and therefore, to attract
    this type of capital some crypto fund managers are willing to forgo a performance
    fee.

- en: Sales Charges
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A fund manager may charge a variety of other fees in addition to a management
    and performance fee. One common type of other fee is known as a sales charge.
    In a crypto context, a sales charge can be thought of as a referral fee that a
    crypto fund manager pays to a third party for referring investors to their fund.
    The sales fee is commonly charged to the investors that were referred on top of
    any fees that the investor would otherwise normally pay to the fund manager had
    they instead gone directly to the crypto fund manager. This sales fee provides
    a commission to the salesperson and is also sometimes referred to as a ***load***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important that a crypto fund manager make the appropriate disclosures
    to investors when a sales fee is charged regarding not only the presence of a
    sales charge, but to which entities it will be paid, the amount of the sales charge
    and any other relevant terms. These disclosures are important because regulatory
    agencies such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission have regularly pursued
    enforcement actions against fund managers for lack of appropriate sales charge
    disclosures. Other sales charge related violations commonly found in the mutual
    funds space where sales charges are common, include failing to offer investors
    or appropriately apply the terms of a discount mechanism known as a ***sales charge
    waiver*** under which sales charges may be waived for investors in certain circumstances
    and for certain share classes.[¹](#FPar1) As crypto funds increasingly become
    subject to regulatory supervision and increase their offerings toward retail markets
    it is likely that the same regulatory scrutiny applied to sales charges in a more
    traditional mutual fund context will likely be extended to crypto funds.

    people utilizing tumblers is that by breaking up the transaction and then reconstructing
    it with new coins, it makes it much more difficult to track. Tumbler services

    actors who use tumblers. For criminals seeking to launder funds the use of a tumbling
    service would assist them in obfuscating the source of their funds, tracking of
    their transactions and even in hiding their identity. Due to the criminal association
    with tumblers, financial regulators and law enforcement agencies have increasingly
    scrutinized these services. In May 2019 Europol in conjunction with the Dutch

    it is useful to discuss the structure and uses of the Internet. Today everyone
    is generally familiar with the concept of the ***Internet***, also referred to
    as the ***World Wide Web*** or simply ***the web***. In practice the Internet
    can be categorized into several smaller categories of pages. There are those webpages
    that most of us are familiar with and that are commonly indexed by traditional
    browsers, such as Google and Bing, these are known as the ***surface web***. Underneath
    the surface web is the ***deep web***. Pages on the deep web are not indexed by
    traditional search engines, but instead are often intentionally hidden. Examples
    of deep web pages include password protected sites that might be utilized for
    things such as subscription services or private chat rooms. For these reasons
    the dark web is also referred to as the ***invisible web.***

    a collection of web pages that are organized in such a way so that they cannot
    be indexed by traditional search engines, such as Google, and employ a variety
    of encryption technologies in order to provide enhanced end-user privacy and anonymity.[⁹](#FPar1)
    The dark web is also referred to as ***darknet***. A common browser utilized to
    access the dark web is named Tor and allows users to access sites via the Tor
    network. Instead of traditional extensions such as “.com” these sites utilize
    the “.onion” extension and are commonly referred to as hidden services or, “onion

    can range from being very simply organized and run similar to basic message boards
    linking up buyers and sellers, to being very sophisticated. Examples of one area
    of DNMs was their use of escrow service where funds, which in many cases would

    dark web black markets have been launched. What has historically happened with
    the black markets is that new ones are launched, and they begin to then grow in
    popularity. Once they become large enough, they begin to draw the attention of
    law enforcement agencies and then eventually get shut down. Historical efforts
    to take down dark markets and prosecute their customers have often utilized international
    and inter-agency cooperation through groups such as the ***Five Eyes Law Enforcement

    Whole Foods, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord and Taylor and Chipotle.[^(19)](#FPar1) Joker’s

    would allow access to the DNM via Tor.[^(20)](#FPar1) In December 2020 it was
    reported that the US Department of Justice and Interpol collaborated to seize
    some of Joker’s Stash external proxy servers resulting in the taking down of the.bazar
    version of the sites.[^(21)](#FPar1) The site eventually voluntarily announced
    that it was closing down in February 2021 but instead attributed the reason to

    DNMs still function today. One of the largest DNMs that accounts for more than
    75% of worldwide dark net revenue is named Hydra. It is popular in Russia and
    had reported sales of over $1.4 billion in 2020.[^(23)](#FPar1) DNMs are also
    increasingly reported to continue to offer an even wider array of illegal good
    and services than they have historically. These include a wider array of illegal
    items such as intellectual property, explosives, chemical weapons, biological
    weapons and nuclear materials. Additionally, as the cryptocurrency space has expanded,
    black market transactions and associated money laundering opportunities are no
    longer limited to just Bitcoin and many black markets support a wide variety of
    crypto transactions. Some DNMs also offer for sale direct money laundering services.

    from 2018 – 2019 total DNM sales grew 70% to over $790 million worth of cryptocurrency.[^(24)](#FPar1)
    In 2021 this figure grew even more to where Darknet markets brought in $1.7 billion
    in cryptocurrency.[^(25)](#FPar1) Despite many media narratives to the contrary,
    the share of overall cryptocurrency transactions represented by criminal activity
    has continued to decline representing just 2.1% in 2019 and then falling to 0.34%
    in 2020.[^(26)](#FPar1) These figures comport with broader historical research
    that showed from 2016 to 2019 the proportion of Bitcoin associated with illegal
    activity has declined while the absolute amount has increased.[^(27)](#FPar1)
    Although this research also acknowledges that a migration to so-called ***shadow
    cryptocurrencies*** that focus on better concealing user’s activity such as Dash,
    Monero and ZCash may have also contributed to the specific use of Bitcoin in illegal
    activities.

    down different aspects of the DNM ecosystem. One example has been when law enforcement
    themselves pose as sellers of items, such as an illegal firearm, on a DNM. Once
    they complete the sale of the item and a decoy weapon has been delivered to the
    unsuspecting purchaser, they then can typically execute a search warrant on the
    purchasers premises for signs of other criminal activity. In the US, this is typically
    known as a ***Rule 41 premise search warrant***.

- en: Law enforcement agencies and prosecutors have increasingly focused on locating
    any cryptocurrency holdings that these DNM purchasers and sellers. Similar to
    criminal investigations involving the use of fiat currency, once the cryptocurrency
    holdings have been located an investigation is then conducted to determine if
    any of the cryptocurrency holdings of the DNM purchaser or seller was utilized
    in criminal activity. If it was then it can often be seized by law enforcement
    however, there are a number of procedures that must be properly followed to ensure
    that the cryptocurrency can be legally seized.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To facilitate these investigations and potential seizures, a key focus has been
    on educating field agents on how to prevent the unwanted transfer of cryptocurrencies
    by the individual that has been arrested or their criminal accomplishes even after
    law enforcement believes they have secured it. This education has included training
    on developing a plan as to how to properly seize cryptocurrency prior to executing
    a search warrant, as well as specific techniques to conduct real world and digital
    searches for items such as cryptocurrency wallet private keys and pneumonic seed
    phrases. To be clear these keys are not always simply written down on paper or
    saved in a text file, but criminals may hide this information in a variety of
    less obvious ways including via QR codes, mixed into image data, in hardware wallets
    and on smartphones.[^(36)](#FPar1)

    enforcement activities when utilizing cryptocurrencies to commit illegal acts.
    An increasingly popular scheme that criminal hackers have pursued with success
    in recent years is known as a ***ransomware attack***. Under this type of attack
    criminals place a malicious type of computer software known as ***malware***,
    on a computer or other network device such as a server or cellphone. This malware
    then typically infects the entire network and restricts legitimate users from
    accessing the devices, network and underlying data. In order to remove the malware
    and unlock the devices the criminals demand a ransom. Once the ransom is paid
    the key is provided to unlock the malware.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These ransoms are typically demanded in the form of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.
    One reason for this is that a criminal does not have to show up in person to collect
    cryptocurrency as they would a large amount of cash. Furthermore, criminals take
    advantage of the increased anonymity afforded by cryptocurrency. Ransomware attacks
    have continued to grow in popularity and the average ransomware payment across
    Canada, the US and Europe tripled from $115,000 in 2019 to $312,000 in 2020.[^(38)](#FPar1)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scope of targets of ransomware attacks runs a wide gamut from individuals
    and small companies to professional sports teams, police departments, large corporations
    and government entities. When providing details on how to pay the ransom to victims,
    the criminals provide a wallet address to which the cryptocurrency is to be transferred.
    Many times, these criminal organizations are so sophisticated and well organized
    that they even have technical support personnel to assist in the payment of the
    ransom and unlocking of the infected systems.

    space. We began with a discussion of considerations related to management and
    performance fees charged by the funds managed by crypto asset managers. As part
    of this conversation, we discussed performance fee variability among crypto funds,
    share class variations and sales charges. Next, we discussed the anti-money laundering
    procedures involved for crypto exchanges. The chapter then turned to a discussion
    of the use of crypto tumblers in money laundering including regulatory case studies.
    Finally, the chapter concluded with a discussion of the interaction of cryptocurrencies
    and the dark web and the use of cryptocurrency for ransomware attack payments.
    In the next chapter we will discuss trends emerging in the cryptocurrency and
    digital asset spaces.
