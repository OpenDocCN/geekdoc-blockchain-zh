  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a decentralised digital ledger, blockchain has become a buzzword in the recent
    years, due to its advantageous characteristics. The application of blockchain
    has been associated with different implications, ranging from trust generator
    to increased efficiency. Recently, blockchain application has gained momentum
    by being implemented by different governments and public bodies, as a solution
    for tackling different issues, with the intent of providing more efficient public
    policies. Different blockchain-based systems and platforms have been increasingly
    introduced as a more secure and orderly alternative of delivering various public
    functions and services. Given the expansion of use cases in different countries
    and the scattered information in this regard, this chapter develops a taxonomy
    of blockchain outcomes in the public domain by identifying the emerging patterns
    and subcategories. The proposed taxonomy can support decision makers and researchers
    to better identify the various blockchain applications, alongside their benefits,
    implications, and possible associated risks.

- en: Blockchain is a decentralized data management technology that, through a distributed
    ledger, provides new ways of managing, governing, storing, and distributing information
    (Iansiti and Lakhami, 2017; SunYin et al, 2019). At the core of blockchain, there
    is a computer protocol acting as an automatic contract enforcing exchanges between
    parties by means of irreversible and secure transactions (Cong et al., 2017).
    Blockchain’s novel technology also presents a new way of establishing trust through
    its different consensus protocols and cryptography that make transactions verifiable
    and fault tolerant (Beck et al.,2016; Shin, 2019). The advantage of blockchain
    is that it also has different architectural configurations allowing for better
    fitting the application of blockchain to different objectives. The different architectural
    dispositions, such as network access, type of consensus mechanism, data control
    and network type, offer the opportunity to allow or restrict access while also
    offering elevated security (Zhang and Lee, 2020).

    blockchain into numerous different applications and sectors that go beyond the
    financial sector and cryptocurrency (Alharby and Moorsel, 2017). The diversity
    of blockchain applications in terms of scope is not only related to the multi-purpose
    nature of such technology, but also to various needs. Governments today continue
    to face the need to be more open and transparent in the eyes of the society (Hollyer
    et al., 2011). In turn, openness and transparency are considered to be the main
    components that lead to building strong accountability and trust in a society
    (Gaventa, 2013; Johnston, 2001). Considering that the root to most of the public
    policies failure is due to incompetence, corruption, or inefficient governance
    (Mueller, 2020), this gives reason to explore blockchain as a possible solution
    to such issues (Hyvarinen, 2017). In fact, blockchain has been adopted in the
    public domain to enforce existing or new policies through a digital transformation
    process that offers a rapid accomplishment to multiple societal goals by different
    governmental bodies (Berryhill, 2018).

    the digital transformation rationale behind the adoption of blockchain in public
    domain, and secondly, to provide a classification of what blockchain outcomes
    derive from different applications. In this regard, we believe that, under specific
    conditions, blockchain can be an enabler of digital transformation (Vial, 2019),
    since it is a technology that creates disruption. Additionally, we agree that
    digital transformation is more often than ever a byproduct of the need to address
    different societal challenges (Majchrzak et al., 2016). By highlighting the value
    created by digital transformation processes when societal challenges are addressed,
    we are interested in looking at the blockchain applications in the public domain
    that demonstrate to have achieved improvements that go beyond the efficiency of
    a specific service. Therefore, we develop a taxonomy (Nickerson et al., 2013)
    that answers the following research question: “What are the observed dimensions
    of blockchain initiatives in the public domain?”.'

    By creating a map of successful applications and the various public functions
    that blockchain could be taken advantage of, we expect to create a better overview
    for decision-makers in the sector who may be interested in blockchain adoption
    or organizations seeking to improve their performances through digital transformation.
    Also, considering the lack of blockchain studies the process of adoption of this
    technology, we expect our findings to identify new research perspectives that
    could pave the way to future studies on blockchain-based systems design and implementation.

- en: In recent years, blockchain has gained popularity in the public domain due to
    successful implementations ranging from public administration to public policy
    and from public offices to supporting whole e-government transformation. For the
    purpose of this study, we incorporate such blockchain applications under the term
    “public domain”. According to OECD, the public domain includes services owned
    or controlled by the government in addition to services that, despite being private,
    are funded by the government or similar authorities (Pilichowski and Turkisch,
    2018).

- en: As regards the wide range of blockchain applications in public domain, from
    notary services to voting (Alketbi et al., 2019; European Commission, 2018), an
    important role has been played by the introduction of smart contracts, a main
    feature of the blockchain technology, as a guarantor of full automation of process
    without the need of intermediaries or even human interaction (Qi et al, 2017).
    A particular area where blockchain has gained momentum is digital government or
    e-government (Hou, 2018; Terzi et al.,2019). Sobolewski and Allesie (2021) show
    that Europe in particular has been quick in exploring and pioneering different
    projects in this regard, but real-life applications have been on the rise even
    in other countries, such as in India, China, UK, and Brazil, etc. (Hou, 2017;
    Ojo and Adebayo, 2017; Deloitte, 2018).

- en: Public administrations as an operational unit in the public domain have proven
    to be a good basis for the application of blockchain, since the very nature of
    their practices is based on data certification, traceability, and transparency
    (Rot et al, 2020), and blockchain does not change the nature of services, rather
    it is expected to facilitate the way in which they are provided (Casino et al.,
    2019). Distinctive features such as citizen trust, privacy and record keeping
    make blockchain a potentially pervasive technology that can be adopted at different
    levels in public administrations (Carter and Ubacht, 2014). Subsequently, studies
    have gone so far as to look at blockchain as the initiator of new governance models
    in the public administration (Olnes, 2016; Hou, 2017; Konashevyc, 2017).

    implemented in the public domain, most of them continue to be hypothetical in
    nature about how blockchain can contribute and its potential in various services.
    Additionally, most of these paper focus on individual cases and do not offer a
    generalized overview of the outcomes. In order for policy makers to have a better
    overview of what to expect from blockchain in the light of their needs, it would
    be important to classify the blockchain applications and link them to different
    dimensions and implications by looking at various initiatives. This would also
    allow for the emergence of the societal challenges that this technology is inherited
    to face.

- en: The versatility of blockchain technology, the application domains of blockchain
    and the different types of blockchain that could be associated with each application,
    have offered a good opportunity for various studies contributing to the classification
    of blockchain and the creation of a diversity of taxonomies. Each taxonomy is
    considered to be a separate category and would provide a way of structuring knowledge
    in a particular field (Glass and Vessey, 1995). Sarkitundu et al., (2016) are
    among the first to study the possibility of creating a taxonomy on the basis of
    blockchain platforms, as a first step into creating a wider taxonomy that would
    encompass the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem. Other early studies, such as Xu
    et al (2017) and Tasca and Tessone (2018), focus on a way of classifying, different
    blockchains on the basis of their architectural design. Wieninger et al. (2019)
    develop a blockchain taxonomy based on blockchain characteristics and how different
    types of blockchain interact. Weking et al. (2019) study the impact of blockchain
    technology on business models by either affecting existing ones or creating new
    ones altogether. Labazova et al. (2019) highlight the importance of developing
    a taxonomy of blockchain applications that categorize all blockchain characteristics
    across different applications and create a taxonomy encompassing the main technical
    components of various blockchains. Recently, Alkhalifah et al. (2020) propose
    a taxonomy based on cybersecurity threats and the possible vulnerabilities, as
    a way of classifying certain aspects of blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite the increase of blockchain studies aiming at classifying it, it is worth
    mentioning that, so far, the resulting taxonomies mainly focus on the technical
    characteristics of blockchain and its various architectural settings. Also, the
    purpose of any taxonomy is based on its intended use, thus with a concrete idea
    of the users to be addressed. From the extensively technical nature of the aforementioned
    studies, it could be inherited that the focus so far has been on technology experts
    and developers. There is a shortcoming in current literature regarding blockchain
    with regard to implications, which makes it important classifying blockchain applications
    adopting this new lens, addressing decision-makers.

    various nature in the public domain and even managers who are primarily concerned
    with the expected benefits that can be gained from a successful implementation.
    Our taxonomy’s user pool also includes researchers and scholars wishing to underpin
    the advantages and limits of blockchain as assessed from real cases: this could
    be the starting point of further research in managerial and governmental studies
    regarding blockchain. Thus, the objective of our study is to classify the effects
    of blockchain applications in public domain: consequently, the meta-characteristics
    in our study relate to consequences and implications, with minimal interference
    to the characteristics of applied blockchain.'

    from the very beginning as an evolutionary step towards a new way of thinking
    about information systems (Brando, 2016; Beck et al., 2017). Research continues
    to draw comparisons between blockchain and traditional information systems (Rossi
    et al., 2019), and goes as far as to consider blockchain as a new infrastructure
    and platform in information systems research (Costantinides et al., 2018). Under
    this perspective, we adopt the Nickerson et al. (2013) taxonomy development method
    especially designed for studies concerning Information Systems. This method proposes
    a process starting with presenting as a first step the meta-characteristics, followed
    by the determination of ending conditions and the approach as summarized in Figure

    of the research is to look at observations and evidence coming from real-life
    case studies. The taxonomy was developed through two inductive iterations. For
    the first iteration, we compiled the list of dimensions, characteristics and applications
    that resulted from the list of publications we reviewed from SCOPUS. In the second
    iteration we did the same thing, this time analyzing the national and international
    governmental reports, which were identified through the first literature review.
    Since no dimension was added following this new iteration, the method was not
    repeated.

    by Nickerson et al., (2013) are fulfilled. Each dimension highlights the main
    features of interest in the taxonomy: they are mutually exclusive and there were
    no dimensions added or merged/split in the last iteration. There is no cell duplication
    and at least one object is classified under each characteristic. Additionally,
    all the application cases in our domain of interest can be classified in the taxonomy
    making it comprehensive, and if a new application case would arise, the taxonomy
    is extensible enough for a new dimension to be added.'

    as the value that a successful blockchain application may contribute to the society.
    It could be considered as a benefit with a wider scope. Differently from Cledou
    et al. (2018) who simply link public value to different benefits perceived by
    users through smart mobility services but do not consider it a taxonomy dimension
    of its own, we consider public value as a separate dimension according to the
    high presence in the application cases and literature reviewed. Table 6 depicts
    the five different public values identified by this study.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The diffusion of an emergent technology, especially until there is a high uncertainty
    around it, is always associated with comparing incremental benefits that would
    come with a successful adoption and the cost attached to such a move (Hall and
    Khan, 2003). Similarly, two main dimensions emerging in our taxonomy are benefits
    and risks. Comprehending the various gains witnessed in different initiatives
    around the world would aid in an easier acceptance of the technology. As regards
    benefits, it should be specified though that the benefits, despite being generalized
    and coming from different sources, should not be taken at face value. De Giovanni
    (2019) in his study regarding the application of blockchain in eco-digital supply
    chains makes a point in stating that advantages of implementing blockchain, despite
    being theoretically evident, should be accompanied by detailed analysis in terms
    of the involved costs or the real convenience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, the second important emerging dimension are the constraints and challenges
    coming along with this technology. Risk identification is considered the first
    step in managing risks and minimizing any hiccups that may arise (Tchankova, 2002).
    This makes it possible for some risk to be mitigated and addressed already at
    a pre-implementation phase. In addition, considering that some risks recognized
    in literature are associated with technical aspects of blockchain, their identification
    should also motivate developers at looking into blockchain to recognize possible
    improvements. This would elevate the status of blockchain and help further applications
    of blockchain, not only in the public domain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Public value is another important dimension considering the domain under consideration.
    For Moore (1995), public value is one of the main components of his famous triangle
    depicting the main elements for a strategic management in the public sector. Similarly,
    Meynhardt et al., (2017) states that the value of public administrations is closely
    connected to the public value they provide through their services. It should be
    also underlined that any system change aimed at public service transformation
    should put public value at the top of the change process in the public domain
    (Tonurist et al., 2019). Therefore, by evidencing the various public values that
    blockchain is able to contribute to could be expected to help in delineating the
    importance of this technology in the public domain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This taxonomy aims to establish a better understanding of blockchain applications
    and facilitate the sharing of knowledge about blockchain initiatives and their
    outcomes. We expect its main findings and classifications to support both decision-makers
    and academic researchers wishing to explore the topic. The implications are both
    for practice and research and can be summarized as following.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For policy makers in the public domain interested in implementing blockchain
    in their practices and institutions, this taxonomy is a starting point for understanding
    the variety of scopes a blockchain adoption relate to, also through several use
    cases presented. Also, it aids policy makers to consider the benefits and risks
    associated with its application, and the possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We believe this taxonomy to have important implications for academic research.
    Considering that the taxonomies created around blockchain have predominantly focused
    on the technical characteristics, an outcome-based taxonomy defines a new mapping
    and standardization of information regarding blockchain. In addition, this study
    bridges the need for investigation of blockchain in public domain and the limited
    research encompassing different areas of the public domain.

- en: 'The main challenge observed during this study refers to the scarcity of detailed
    data on the results of the blockchain applications in the various sectors provided
    in most studies. Very often, the blockchain application is associated with what
    can be considered as expected benefits and implications, yet not supplemented
    with empirical findings certifying the claims. Another challenge regards the lack
    of a repository regarding blockchain initiatives per country. Some countries have
    indeed written reports on some of their initiatives, but such reports are still
    impaired due to different reasons. The first reason being that they are not yearly
    reports, thus do not offer a follow-up on important initiatives. Additionally,
    such reports mostly aim at studying successful cases: despite their importance,
    they do not cover pilot projects or prototypes that, albeit having failed, would
    offer an insightful view on the reasons behind such failures.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of possible limitations, this study focuses on applications undertaken
    in the public domain. Being the blockchain adopted in many fields, it is important
    to consider that results could differentiate based on the domain of study. Furthermore,
    new blockchain applications are being deployed every day, which may raise the
    need to extend the taxonomy or compress it in case some of the issues have been
    addressed. Still referring to the need of progressing research on blockchain,
    this study creates the opportunity for further investigations looking more specifically
    to possible connections between our taxonomy and technical values researched by
    previous studies. This would shed light on possible links between blockchain outcomes
    and some technical characteristic, such as type of blockchain, consensus mechanisms,
    encryption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, it would be interesting a similar study adapted to the private
    sector, to see whether there exist differentiations based on the nature of the
    industry blockchain is applied to. Also, considering that most research on blockchain
    today aims at improving the limitations of the technology from an architecture
    and security point, future studies could shift the attention on challenges going
    beyond the technical perspective.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since its introduction, blockchain has become an ever-growing topic of interest
    and has seen a surge in applications in various domains. There has been an increase
    in governmental initiatives around the world to explore further this technology,
    with many institutions and organizations in the public domain already having started
    to implement blockchain for various scopes and purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this paper we propose a taxonomy able of classifying the outcomes of the
    aforementioned initiatives in the public domain. Different from previous taxonomies,
    our study shifts the focus from the technical characteristics of blockchain to
    the implications regarding its adoption. Along the process, we recognized six
    different dimensions, each with its own characteristics and features. In addition,
    through extensive literature research, this study provides a list of some important
    initiatives in public domain and matches these initiatives with the dimensions
    recognized in the taxonomy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This study contributes to the current state of research on blockchain by providing
    a new way of classifying blockchain applications and, more specifically, by focusing
    on the public domain where such studies lack. The proposed taxonomy offers valuable
    insight to policy makers considering adopting blockchain, by offering an overview
    of the lessons learned from previous applications. It also enables decision makers
    to understand the possible challenges, offering the opportunity of tackling potential
    constraints in an initial phase.
