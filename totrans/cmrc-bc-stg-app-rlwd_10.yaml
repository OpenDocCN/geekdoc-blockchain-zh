    Adoption: The User Interface'

- en: The biggest barrier to Blockchain adoption will be the user interface – the
    way that a human interacts with Blockchain technology will be critical to adoption.
    If we look at the current applications of Blockchain (namely cryptocurrencies)
    you will see that we have a concept of ‘wallets’.
  id: totrans-9

- en: A wallet is the interface between the Blockchain technology (the transactions)
    and the human interface. This is often very basic and complex for the end user
    to make use of and benefit from. Wallets are evolving quickly, and the technology
    is improving to allow the wallet to be more intuitive and customer friendly.

    must operate ‘like normal technology’. If you look at the enterprise Blockchain
    solutions, the large organizations are integrating the technology into current
    systems, or alongside current systems and retaining the same user ‘look and feel’;
    this ensures the end user is able to maximize the use and benefits of the Blockchain
    technology.  ### Smartphone as ID'

    We use our phones to pay bills, order food, book time off, submit expenses, watch
    a movie, chat with our friends, video chat with our colleagues, and sometimes
    we even use them to chat to another human!

    of birth, IP address, etc. – all our interactions are based on an ID. With Blockchain
    technology, we can securely use our smartphone as an ID device. We can keep our
    data secured, and use Blockchain technology to secure our transactions with other
    parties.
  id: totrans-14

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    organizations and governments around the world are looking to implement. Imagine

    technology – your ID will be safe, and you can interact more quickly and simply
    compared to today.

    data.

    a QR code; they are secure and there are billions of possible combinations (to
    prevent fraud). I can envisage a world where we scan a QR code on our phone to
    open the door to our home, pay for the taxi and order the takeaway food. All the
    transactions will be seamless for the user, but the data will be safe and secured
    – ensuring the safety of the customer identity, but delivering the service they
    expect.

    technology? These are two questions I am often asked and often reflect on.
  id: totrans-29

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's tackle the first question. Do people understand Blockchain technology?
    My answer is a categorical – ‘no’. We are in a world of ‘fake news’ and misinformation
    where Blockchain is frequently misrepresented. Most press coverage of Blockchain
    technology surrounds Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies. In January 2018, the value
    of these hit a record high due to the ‘mass hysteria’ around the potential of
    this technology.
  id: totrans-30

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of pounds were raised by over a thousand projects to fund ‘Blockchain ideas’.
    As I will discuss in [Chapter 8](c08.xhtml), most of this was raised for ideas
    and not real projects; often there was not even a need for Blockchain technology.
  id: totrans-31
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 2019, this hysteria has calmed down. I hear more and more people discussing
    Blockchain technology and that it is more than just Bitcoin and the crypto market.
    The conversations are often misinformed and often take the Bitcoin price graph
    as a reflection that Blockchain technology is dead.
  id: totrans-32

    technology is not dead; in fact, it is quite the opposite and the start of the

    And the answer to this is again a categorical ‘no’. Why do people need to understand
    how this works? Do you know how a database works? Or how your car works? Or how
    the 5G network operates? In most cases we do not – and, more importantly, we do
    not need to – we just need to know it works.'
  id: totrans-35

    used for? Not so much about how it works. As you will know, this book is written
    for that exact reason – to inform people as to what, how, and where Blockchain
    technology can be used, and why Blockchain is at the start of a revolution.
  id: totrans-36

    adopt it quickly. Once we see the impacts of Blockchain technology, we will naturally
    adopt this and take it for granted that it works.
  id: totrans-37

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My last point is that, because trust is replaced by technology, we need to rethink
    what this means and how this affects our lives. Trust is an emotional word, and
    is linked to our deep seated beliefs and culture. To suggest that this can be
    replaced by technology is a fundamental shift in our understanding of trust and
    its emotional impact.
  id: totrans-38
