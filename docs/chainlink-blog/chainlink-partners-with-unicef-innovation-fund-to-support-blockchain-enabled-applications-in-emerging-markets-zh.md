[T0】 Chainlink Community Incentive Program provides financial support for many development teams and researchers, helping them to further improve the function, usability and social influence of Chainlink network. Excellent developers and development teams in our community [are welcome to click here](https://chainlinkgrants.typeform.com/to/efEbsq) to apply for the incentive plan. If you are a researcher and want to cooperate with us, please contact us [](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e4c5b4d5b5f4c5d567e5d565f575052575055525f5c4d105d5153).

Our vision is to use smart contracts to create a more economical and fair world. Around this vision, we launched the [Social Impact Plan](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-expands-grant-program-to-support-social-impact-projects/) , actively supported projects with the same goal, built an encryption system to gradually get rid of the influence of brand endorsement, and paid more attention to the real value provided by institutions and individuals. To further promote this project, we are pleased to announce our donation to the Innovation Fund and CryptoFund of UNICEF. UNICEF Innovation Fund provides funds for start-ups to develop early-stage, open-source technologies to solve key global challenges; The cryptocurrency fund is a new financing channel of UNICEF, which is used to receive, hold and pay cryptocurrency. Chainlink community incentive bonus will be used for blockchain solution start-ups supported by UNICEF, providing them with funds, guidance and expertise.

Some uses of the bonus provided by Chainlink for UNICEF Innovation Fund and Cryptocurrency Fund include:

*   Fund early, free and open-source blockchain software, which is developed for emerging markets and aims to help emerging markets achieve technological leapfrogging and greatly improve people's quality of life.
*   Provide specific domain expertise and additional resources for blockchain start-ups supported by UNICEF cryptocurrency fund.
*   Improve the ability of start-ups to develop solutions to provide them to those who need innovative applications most, and accelerate the promotion of blockchain as a force for good.

UNICEF started the Innovation Fund in 2016 to understand and participate in the development of emerging technologies by investing and supporting start-ups in blockchain, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence. The cryptocurrency fund and innovation fund provide legal tender and cryptocurrency financial support for early start-ups.

By donating to UNICEF's cryptocurrency fund, Chainlink will further help early start-ups expand their operation scale and enhance the social benefits of the project. Some projects supported by encryption fund include: using AI to analyze data, improving public services in Argentina, making sensitive medical data in Mexico portable while ensuring privacy, using interactive voice response, popularizing COVID-19's epidemic prevention knowledge in Cambodia, and improving food and vaccine distribution in India.

Chainlink incentive program covers many social impact projects, and UNICEF's crypto fund is just one of them. Chainlink also helps small farmers buy agricultural insurance, improves the transparency of state lottery, sets up Hacker Pine Awards and funds educational projects, rewards smart contracts that promote government innovation, and lets the world know more about the power of blockchain technology. We will continue to make every effort to build an economic and fair world, continue to help developers use hybrid smart contracts to achieve major technological leapfrogging in emerging markets, and significantly reduce systemic risks in developed markets.

Thomas Davin, head of UNICEF Innovation Office, said: "We are grateful to Chainlink for funding us. Open source technology to solve the most pressing challenges faced by children can obtain more transparent global investment through blockchain and cryptocurrency. Our job is to show this. With additional funding, the Innovation Fund can expand its scale and support more innovative projects aimed at improving the global quality of life.

We hope to continuously empower more and more teams, researchers and socially influential projects in Chainlink Ecology through Chainlink Community Incentive Program, help them to research and develop key tools and infrastructure, accelerate the development of universal connected intelligent contracts, ensure the security of Oracle network and fully realize the influence of technology, so as to make the world a better place. We will continue to support the community to provide key assistance for the rapid growth of Chainlink ecology. Only by cooperating with the community can we develop the universal connected smart contract into a mainstream digital protocol.
