    technologies and the implications that these emerging technologies will have on
    different aspects of the finance and accounting. Such an analysis and examination,
    however, would be incomplete without at least mentioning how these changes are
    being viewed from a bigger picture and macroeconomic level. Data and other quantitative
    information are, as has been discussed both in this text as well as numerous others,
    may very well represent the next competitive advantage for organizations both
    now and going forward. Stepping outside of the financial services arena for a
    brief minute this trend is arguably more evident in search, social media, and
    the entertainment spaces. Technology giants such as Google, Facebook, Alibaba,
    Amazon, and Netflix have access – and use – the vast quantities of information
    available to them to generate new insights, improve business models, and increase
    margins. These advances and business improvements, however, have not come without
    costs and increased regulatory scrutiny. One need merely to look at the hearings
    that Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Apple have had to contend with during 2017
    and beyond to see that as corporate power increases governments across the globe
    will become increasingly interested.

    from what is already occurring in the financial services space as emerging technology
    play an increasingly important role. Drilling down specifically, and returning
    the conversation to the financial services space, the regulatory pressure facing
    organizations is already high and set to increase. Taking publicly available statements
    and memos, it does seem that financial organizations are going to come under increased
    regulatory scrutiny – at least in the United States – as Democrats consolidate
    power and assume various positions of leadership in the U.S. Congress. Not entirely
    unfounded as a result of both memories of the Great Recession and the increases
    in consolidation that have followed, blockchain and other emerging technologies
    may actually increase the pace of consolidation and market concentration. This
    might seem like a contraction to the underlying ethos of blockchain, which supporters
    contend will eventually disrupt the financial system entirely, but upon future
    examination it does indeed make sense. Information itself, including but not limited

    or failure of different firms, requires scale and professional competency.

- en: Blockchain may actually increase the risk associated with the financial system.
    Many of the proponents and advocates for increased blockchain adoption and integration
    emphasize the benefits, including reduced risk associated with financial transactions
    and data storage. The combination of a virtually immutable record with unhackable
    (until this point) encryption means that data will in fact be more secure than
    under previous systems. Even with these benefits, however, the centralized system
    and model that currently underpins the financial system does generate numerous
    efficiencies and protections, especially for consumers. Thinking back to the origin
    of the current financial system and construct, the centralization trend that dominates
    the marketplace means that consumers are protected, insurance and other risk reducing
    strategies are possible, and that risk can be shared between counterparties. A
    distributed and decentralized financial system, lacking a centralized clearinghouse,
    could expose counterparties and institutions to risk that is currently offset
    and contained by regulations and frameworks. Certainly, a distributed and decentralized
    model can, and already is, allowing more and more participants access to capital
    markets and information, but there is also a risk from an institutional perspective
    that must be assessed as well.

  zh: 区块链实际上可能会增加与金融系统相关的风险。许多支持者和倡导者支持增加区块链采用和整合，并强调其益处，包括减少与金融交易和数据存储相关的风险。几乎不可变的记录与不可破解（至此为止）的加密相结合，意味着数据实际上将比以前的系统更安全。然而，目前支撑金融系统的集中化系统和模型确实带来了许多效率和保护措施，特别是对于消费者来说。回想一下目前金融系统和结构的起源，主导市场的集中化趋势意味着消费者受到保护，保险和其他降低风险的策略是可能的，并且风险可以在交易对手之间共担。分布式和去中心化的金融系统，缺乏集中的清算所，可能会暴露交易对手和机构面临的目前通过法规和框架抵消和控制的风险。当然，分布式和去中心化的模型可以，而且已经正在让越来越多的参与者进入资本市场和信息，但从制度角度来看，也存在一定的风险，必须进行评估。
- en: Corporate governance, as discussed throughout this text in both Parts 1 and
    2, is an important fiduciary role that financial professionals must play and fulfill
    in the marketplace. Specifically, and in accordance with the responsibility professionals
    have to protect investors, financial and accounting professionals have a duty
    to examine, contest, and hold the data reported by management to a certain level
    of scrutiny. Although the blockchain concept, at the core of the idea, emphasizes
    transparency and encryption; this paradox exposes a flaw in the model that could
    eventually undermine the validity of corporate governance initiatives.

    its very nature, creates opportunities for professionals who understand not only
    how the cryptography functions on an operational level, but also how the impact
    of cryptography drives other business process improvements. For example, if consumers
    and organizations are more confident in the security and protection over financial
    information, it becomes simpler to engage in cross border and cross industry transactions.
    Taking a look at actual examples, imagine an entrepreneur or small business owner
    looking to access capital markets, but being unable to do so; something financial

    does pose a unique set of challenges for practitioners. The primary driver of
    this challenge returns to exactly what some of the benefits of blockchain and

    is an often cited benefit and positive attributed associated of blockchain, but
    not every business situation calls for or is appropriate for anonymous communication.
    Counterparty risk, the same type of risk that threatened to undermine the global
    financial system during the Great Recession, can actually be amplified in a situation
    or landscape with increased anonymity. The entirety of trade finance and the flowing
    of funds between different institutions and organizations relies on a sophisticated
    system and infrastructure of insurance, identity verification, and risk reducing
    tools that could possibly be undermined due to the identities of certain individuals
    or associated organizations being obscured. This is not new news or information;

  zh: Lex cryptographica，虽然并非代表一种全新的技术或操作模式 - 毕竟加密技术已存在数百年 - 但对从业者提出了一套独特的挑战。这一挑战的主要驱动力恰恰在于区块链和加密货币在业务流程和运营环境中的一些益处。匿名性经常被引用为区块链的一个优势和积极属性，但并不是每种商业情况都需要或适合匿名通信。对手方风险，也就是在大萧条期间有可能破坏全球金融体系的那种风险，实际上在具有更高匿名性的情况或环境中可能会被放大。整个贸易金融和不同机构和组织之间资金流动依赖于一个复杂的保险系统和基础设施，该系统包括身份验证、降低风险的工具，而这一切可能会因某些个人或相关组织的身份被掩盖而受到损害。这并不是新闻或信息；这些与区块链相关的特征和潜在风险自从加密货币和区块链引入主流商业讨论以来就已被相对充分地记录下来。
- en: Focusing back to the financial services profession, however, there are several
    different implications that have an effect directly on various aspects of the
    financial services profession and landscape. First, from an accounting perspective
    there are multiple situations in which increased anonymity or encryption connected
    to different types of data and information, and a few of these are linked directly
    to audit and attestation services. For example, how would an auditor and audit
    team be able to accurately assess the value and ownership of various assets that
    are stored or governed by a blockchain based model of storage and transmission.
    Verifying valuation and different types of information and data, especially those
    connected to assets owned or controlled by an entity, form an important point

  zh: 焦点回到金融服务行业，然而，有几个问题会直接对金融服务行业和环境的各个方面产生影响。首先，从会计的角度来看，存在多种情况增加了匿名性或与不同类型数据和信息相关的加密，其中有一些直接与审计和验证服务相关。例如，如何使审计员和审计团队能够准确评估由基于区块链的存储和传输模型存储或管理的各种资产的价值和所有权。验证估值和与实体拥有或控制的资产相关的各种信息和数据，对于任何审计或验证业务来说都是一个重要的问题。然而，如果资产的保管、转移和价值通过不同层次的加密被掩盖或隐藏，这将为讨论增加额外的复杂性。

    on a purely domestic basis or engages in international trade and commerce, businesses
    must be able to confirm that balances – from an investment, payable, and receivable
    side – are accurately accounted for and reported. While the transparency affiliated
    with information and data stored on a blockchain model certainly helps with the
    communication of data, but that same transparency can actually pose issues and

- en: First, teams of practitioners and professionals will need to become more diverse,
    both in terms of personnel and the skill sets that are brought to the conversation.
    These skills are going to include a variety of different factors, including but
    not limited to legal, technical, communicative, and analytical problem solving
    competencies. While this might not seem like news or a piece of information that
    is new to anyone who is actually working in the profession, the implications are
    just beginning to be understood. At the core of this shift is the underlying market
    reality that, even at the Top 100 accounting firms, CPAs only account for approximately
    20% of staff that deal with client issues, down from approximately 33% of staff
    just a decade ago. If even the largest CPA firms, with long held (and deserved)
    expertise for financial reporting, tax, and attestation engagements are only employing
    a relatively small percentage of employees that are CPAs this demonstrates serious
    implications for the rest of the financial services landscape.

  zh: 首先，从业者和专业人士团队需要变得更加多样化，无论是在人员还是带入讨论的技能方面。这些技能将包括各种不同的因素，包括但不限于法律、技术、交际和分析问题解决能力。虽然这可能听起来不像是对实际从业人员有什么新闻或信息，但其潜在影响才刚刚开始被理解。这一转变的核心是市场的基本现实，即在排名前100的会计事务所，仅有大约20%的员工是处理客户问题的执业会计师（CPAs），这一比例从大约10年前的33%下降。即使是最大的会计事务所，长期以来在财务报告、税收和审计业务上拥有（并且理应拥有）专业知识，其员工中执业会计师的比例只占很小的一部分，这对于金融服务行业的其他领域产生了严重的影响。
- en: Second, but connected to this shift occurring under the surface at the largest
    accounting organizations, is the fact that a similar shift is already underway
    in trading, investment, and capital market firms. Some of the most high profile
    hedge funds and investment pools in the world, including those based in the United
    States and internationally, are increasingly driven and managed by quantitative
    analysts and traders versus traditional financial analysts. The CFA designation
    is, and still remains, a robust and very much respected credential in the marketplace,
    but is not necessary anymore to launch a trading organization. The real question
    is, and will continue to be, that even if venerable designations such as the CPA
    and CFA designations are ceding ground to technology and quantitative professionals,
    what does this mean for professionals working without said credentials and experience.
    Not meant to inspire anxiety, but simply meant as a reality check for practitioners
    or firms that are not appreciating the disruptive nature of these emerging technologies;
    they are already in the marketplace and are driving change across different organizations.
    Such change, however disruptive it may be, also creates opportunities for organizations
    and firms willing to drill down, engage in new market areas, and be proactive
    members of the financial technology community.

    to take a step back and to frame the conversation before drilling down into specific
    business implications. The view from the top should be thought of as an opportunity
    to research, view, and frame out the specific business implications of emerging
    technologies on financial services. While not always specifically applicable to
    every financial services role or professional, being able to see and understand
    how emerging technologies fit into the business landscape at large is an integral
    part of how finance can play a more strategic role in the business decision making
    process. Offering strategic advice and guidance to clients across any number of
    sector lines means that professionals must understand from a technical and operational
    perspective. This is what is addressed in this next section of the book; applications
    and implications of emerging technology tools. Part II of this book attempts to
    break down, and provide actionable business intelligence, related to how emerging
    can – and already is – being used across different industry lines. This section
    of the book should be thought of as a tool and framework to help professionals
    see how these technologies are being used, understand what future applications
    can be developed, and learn from leading firms in the space.

  zh: 在了解正在推动更广泛的金融服务行业变革的一些技术术语和概念后，很有必要在深入讨论具体的业务影响之前，退一步来构想对话。从高层视角来看待这个问题，应该被视为一个机会，可以研究、观察并构建出新兴技术对金融服务的具体业务影响。虽然并不总是具体适用于每个金融服务角色或专业人士，但能够看到并理解新兴技术如何融入业务格局是金融在业务决策过程中成为更具战略性角色的一个重要部分。向在各个行业中为各种部门提供战略建议和指导，意味着专业人士必须从技术和运营角度来理解。这就是本书的下一节要讨论的内容；新兴技术工具的应用和影响。本书的第二部分试图分解并提供与新兴技术如何，在不同行业线上被应用以及可以被开发出什么未来应用，以及从空间领先公司学习的相关的可操作的业务情报。本书的这部分应该被视为一个辅助工具和框架，帮助专业人士了解这些技术正在如何被使用，理解未来的应用场景，并从该领域的领先公司中学习。
