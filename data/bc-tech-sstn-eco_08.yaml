  zh: 摘要
- en: As a new economic paradigm, circular economy (CE) has recently gained attention.
    CE aims to detect, recover, sustain or increase value by transitioning from a
    ‘take, make and waste’ approach of production system to an ecosystem economy,
    thus restraining the environmental effect and waste of resources throughout the
    product economy, providing profitability and flexibility and creating value of
    what is considered a waste. Cities’ role in driving CE forward has been observed
    as being increasingly important to reach Sustainable Development. For this reason,
    there is an urgency to understand what a circular city is and how it might be
    composed. On the other side, blockchain is a method of recording information in
    a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack or cheat the system.
    This chapter initially explores the definition and characteristics of blockchain
    in detail. Then, several application scenarios of blockchain technology for a
    CE with focus on Singapore while transitioning to a CE are put forward. Finally,
    some of the challenges including energy consumption, lack of adequate skill set,
    the cost associated with the advanced technology and the need for raising awareness
    of circular business models, that still exist when applying the current blockchain
    technology to the CE, are discussed and analysed.

  zh: 作为一种新的经济范式，循环经济（CE）最近受到了关注。CE旨在通过从生产系统的“取、制、废”方法向生态系统经济过渡，检测、恢复、维持或增加价值，从而限制产品经济过程中的环境影响和资源浪费，提供盈利性和灵活性，并创造被认为是废物的价值。城市在推动CE向前发展的作用观察到越来越重要，以实现可持续发展。因此，迫切需要了解循环城市是什么以及它可能如何组成。另一方面，区块链是一种记录信息的方式，使其难以或无法更改、黑客攻击或欺诈系统。本章首先详细探讨了区块链的定义和特点。然后，在过渡到循环经济的过程中，提出了几个关注新加坡的区块链技术应用场景。最后，讨论和分析了在将当前区块链技术应用于CE时仍然存在的挑战，包括能源消耗、缺乏适当的技能集、与先进技术相关的成本以及提高循环商业模式意识的必要性。

    of a new economic period [[9](#CR9)]. Technology supporters discuss that blockchain
    creates the base for trustworthy distributed record systems that could be essential
    to how personal and inter-organizational relationships are planned [[7](#CR7)].
    It is likely to have special effect on relationship, which is mainly caused by
    the ability of the technology to allow unaffectedly trust-free social and economic
    transactions that are imposed via a confirmed and transparent record and value
    exchange mechanisms without the support of a central authority [[8](#CR8)].

    [[68](#CR68), [84](#CR84), [85](#CR85), [93](#CR93)]. The demand to set blockchain
    in such type of circumstances not only outlines the point that the technology
    reduces the use of intermediaries, in fact it is usually anticipated to develop
    the security of particular infrastructures and records, to expedite transparency

    of these design studies. Actually, the outcomes of the IT articles are usually
    built upon a group of assumptions related to sociotechnical subjects, namely through
    disregarding the governance and coordination cost, neglecting the privacy issues
    along with the risk factors concerning the efficiency and efficacy of a clever

    acute viewpoints on blockchain in the IS researches (e.g. [[7](#CR7), [68](#CR68),

    of the special effects of the particular parts of the blockchain and an analysis

    are based on theory outside the blockchain’s primary use situation as the practical
    support of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin is limited [[25](#CR25), [93](#CR93)]. This
    could be due to the scholars’ shortage of knowledge on how to group data for effective

    specific to the extremely technical. For instance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency
    exchange, Coinbase, describes blockchain as follows: ‘a distributed, public ledger
    that contains the history of every bitcoin transaction’ [[20](#CR20)]. From an
    application-specific definition, this description does not reflect the point that
    blockchain could be reprocessed for other cryptocurrencies and industry applications
    autonomously. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the definition of the
    blockchain is slightly broader and described as follows: ‘a digital ledger in
    which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically
    and publicly’ (Oxford [[87](#CR87)]). According to Sulan [[108](#CR108)], this
    definition is also limited as blockchain technology could be used independently
    from cryptocurrencies and Bitcoins. The above-mentioned definitions focus on the
    role of a blockchain as a digital ledger, yet this field is still rising and growing
    fast. The usage of the ledger is one of the features of the blockchain but not
    its core. This feature mainly affects blockchain application that emphasizes on
    the interchange of value management in case of virtual assets.'

  zh: 对于区块链存在不同的定义，从特定应用到非常技术性的都有。例如，世界上最大的加密货币交易所Coinbase，这样描述区块链：“一个分布式、公共账本，包含了每一个比特币交易的历史”
    [[20](#CR20)]. 从特定应用的定义来看，这个描述没有反映出区块链可以被重新处理用于其他加密货币和行业应用的自主性。根据《牛津英语词典》，区块链的定义稍微广泛一些，如下所述：“一个数字账本，在其中比特币或其他加密货币的交易按时间顺序和公开记录”
    (Oxford [[87](#CR87)]). 根据Sulan [[108](#CR108)]，这个定义也是有限的，因为区块链技术可以独立于加密货币和比特币使用。上述定义主要关注区块链作为数字账本的角色，然而这个领域仍在兴起并快速发展。账本的使用是区块链的一个特点，但不是其核心。这一特点主要影响强调虚拟资产价值管理的区块链应用。
- en: 'Another wider definition by Webopedia defines blockchain as follows: ‘a type
    of data structure that enables identifying and tracking transactions digitally
    and sharing this information across a distributed network of computers. The distributed
    ledger technology offered by blockchain provides a transparent and secure means
    for tracking the ownership and transfer of assets’ [[106](#CR106)].'

    [[106](#CR106)].
- en: Even though this description prospers the main characteristic of the blockchain,
    it focuses on the distribution as the core feature of the blockchain computing,
    yet lacks the acknowledgement that blockchains are not only a distributed technology,

    (Wright 和 De Filippi 2015)。
- en: According to Sulan [[108](#CR108)], the main distinction here is that the distributed
    system divides the task among contributors in an ideal manner while a blockchain
    demands from every contributor to sustain a full bulge of the system and impose
    its regulations autonomously. In a system which bulges function on domestic information
    to achieve goals instead of the result of the central assembling impact, this
    decentralization guarantees that dragging the plug is almost not possible. In
    order for the network to operate, only one node is needed to continue functioning.
    Clearly, there is a demand for a strong and brief definition of blockchain. Taking
    into account previous definitions, blockchain can be defined as a ‘a decentralized
    database containing sequential, cryptographically linked blocks of digitally signed
    asset transactions, governed by a consensus model.’

  zh: 根据苏兰 [[108](#CR108)] 的观点，主要的区别在于，分布式系统理想地将在各个贡献者之间分配任务，而区块链则要求每个贡献者维持系统的完整膨胀并自主实施其规定。在一个通过国内信息实现目标而不是中央汇编影响的膨胀系统中，这种去中心化确保了几乎不可能拔掉插头。为了使网络运行，只需要一个节点继续工作。显然，需要一个强大而简洁的区块链定义。考虑到之前的定义，区块链可以被定义为“一个去中心化的数据库，包含一系列通过加密链接的、数字签名的资产交易块，由共识模型管理。”
- en: Sulan [[108](#CR108)] believes that this definition aims to focus on the core
    elements for blockchain technology where it is a peer-to-peer network database
    ruled by set of regulations. In addition, blockchains embody a moving away from
    a conventional trust agent and shift towards transparency. Blockchain allows applications

- en: Transactions and Smart Contracts—Transaction occurs via exchange of assets which
    are managed through the company services’ guidelines. These guidelines are reflected
    via scripting languages (e.g. Bitcoin’s forth) and are operated for progressive
    transactions that need to be implemented, where they also build the foundation
    for smart contract. In order to manage a transaction, a smart contract, which
    is a group of logic guidelines in the form of a coded script, needs to be inserted.
    The contract is implemented independently and is used to manage the transaction
    [[15](#CR15)]. In this method, contract performs like smart software agents [[104](#CR104)].
    After a smart contract is implemented in the blockchain, it turns into an independent
    agent that is unable to be tampered. Following this stage, an application then
    recites the codes when executing a transaction, perform and process the outcomes.
    The nature of the smart contract is not limited to an application-specific code.
    It is also used to classify the condition and terms of a contract into the workflow
    of the transaction. Ethereum (the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin)
    is an alt-coin technology that has been developed to support smart contracts.

  zh: 交易和智能合约——交易通过资产的交换进行，这些资产是通过公司服务指南进行管理的。这些指南通过脚本语言（例如比特币的四则运算）体现出来，并为需要实施的渐进式交易构建基础，同时也构建了智能合约的基础。为了管理一项交易，需要插入一个智能合约，它是一组以编码脚本形式呈现的逻辑指南。合约独立实施，并用于管理交易[[15](#CR15)]。在这种方法中，合约像智能软件代理[[104](#CR104)]一样执行。在区块链上实施智能合约后，它变成一个无法被篡改的独立代理。在这个阶段之后，应用程序在执行交易时会读取代码，执行并处理结果。智能合约的性质不仅限于特定应用程序的代码。它还用于将合同的条件和条款分类到交易的工作流程中。以太坊（继比特币之后的第二大加密货币）是一种支持智能合约的alt-coin技术。
- en: Consensus and Trust—Blockchain is trusted by agreement as all related parties
    should have the same copies of the blockchain, yet each member still have to validate
    it. The core strength of the blockchain is in its decentralization aspect taking
    into account its database is owned by all members. To make sure that each copy
    is reliable, an agreed algorithm is needed. The agreed algorithm permits the public
    to confirm that every single added block is authentic. It also stops the attackers
    from bargaining and splitting the chain [[21](#CR21)]. Another approach recommended
    was to use proof-of-work method where a hard cryptographic puzzle needs to be
    resolved by miners [[79](#CR79)]. Miners consume resources and are acknowledged
    for their work through several motivations. There are also other models, namely
    proof-of-burn, proof-of-elapsed-time, proof-of-stake and proof-of-capacity which
    have been recommended in the literature to handle the flaws of the initial proof-of-work
    model by trying to equalize objectivity and source spending [[57](#CR57)]. According
    to Sulan [[108](#CR108)], blockchain by nature is suspicious. It has been created
    to reduce the necessity for any object to enter transactions. It builds a reliable
    model according to a group agreement, as the network confirms the transactions
    and approved their adding to the chain. There is no intermediary, hence the idea
    of trust continues to be inherent as every record in the blockchain is confirmed
    by the public that carries serval copies of the blockchain. When trust mediators
    are eliminated from transactions, blockchain is capable of interrupting several
    main businesses. The customary transaction models count on dominant expert to
    perform in the clearinghouse character. Trust is given to the dominant expert
    with a probability that it will continue to be truthful during clearing transactions
    and validation. The occurrences of records are included with the dominant expert.
    In case the dominant expert is cooperated deliberately, such as hacking, then
    the interlocutor has the ability to inflict a widespread chaos into the system.
    The blockchain model reduces the dominant expert through distributing copies of
    the records to all related parties (Fig. [1](#Fig1)). Every single contributor
    keeps their own case of the blockchain. They transmit the variations through creating
    fresh blocks and ask for confirmation as per the agreed model rules. As soon as
    it is confirmed, the block would be added to everyone’s chain. The method is likely
    more secure than the customary model, and the intermediary agent is not needed
    anymore, which raises an interruption to the current situation.![../images/520662_1_En_8_Chapter/520662_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_8_Chapter/520662_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png)

  zh: 共识与信任——区块链之所以被信任，是因为所有相关方都应拥有相同版本的区块链，但每个成员仍需对其进行验证。区块链的核心优势在于其去中心化特点，考虑到其数据库由所有成员共同拥有。为确保每个副本都可靠，需要一个共识算法。共识算法允许公众验证每个添加的区块是否真实。它还阻止了攻击者进行讨价还价和分裂链的行为[[21](#CR21)]。另一种推荐的方法是使用工作量证明（proof-of-work）方法，矿工需要解决一个困难的加密谜题[[79](#CR79)]。矿工消耗资源，并通过多种激励措施获得认可。还有其他模型，即证明燃烧（proof-of-burn）、证明流逝时间（proof-of-elapsed-time）、证明股份（proof-of-stake）和证明容量（proof-of-capacity），已经在文献中推荐，试图通过平衡客观性和源支出来处理原始工作量证明模型的缺陷[[57](#CR57)]。根据Sulan的观点[[108](#CR108)]，区块链本质上是有嫌疑的。它被设计用来减少任何对象进入交易的必要性。它根据群体协议建立一个可靠的模型，因为网络确认交易并批准将其添加到链上。没有中介，因此信任的概念仍然是内在的，因为区块链上的每个记录都由持有多个副本的人群所确认。当信任中介从交易中被消除时，区块链有能力中断多个主要业务。传统的交易模型依赖于主导专家在清算所的角色。信任是赋予主导专家的，前提是它在清算交易和验证过程中继续诚实。记录的发生与主导专家一起包含。如果主导专家被故意合作，比如被黑客攻击，那么对方有能力对系统造成广泛混乱。区块链模型通过将记录副本分发给所有相关方来减少主导专家（见图[1](#Fig1)]）。每个贡献者都保留他们自己的区块链案例。他们通过创建新块来传递变化，并按照约定的模型规则请求确认。一旦得到确认，该区块将被添加到每个人的链上。这种方法可能比传统模型更安全，不再需要中介代理，这改变了现状。![../images/520662_1_En_8_Chapter/520662_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/520662_1_En_8_Chapter/520662_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.png)

    of blocks, called blockchain, and is confirmed via an agreed model that includes
    major computing assets. Since the blockchain is a file with open-access feature
    and simulated on several full nodes of the system, there is no object that can
    control the list of transaction. As each block is shredded and implanted into
    the chain, it is undeniable and acts as the last record of the previous transactions.
    An object is not able to modify the chain unless it changes all the other blocks
    that are after it, and this is a hard and costly computational effort. Hence,
    this safeguards the blockchain and builds a truthful autonomous of a dominant

    six pillars that businesses should apply for a shift towards circular economy.
    Such method was not initially planned for CE application in cities yet some of
    its principles add towards a circular city as long as they are implemented thoroughly.
    One of the pillars ‘Regenerate’ aims to reinstate the natural capital and escalate
    the ecosystems’ flexibility through recurring the precious biological nutrients
    carefully to the environment either through anaerobic absorption or composting.
    This is facilitated through the support to support viewpoint which indicates that
    technical and biological beneficial need to be dispersed during the product’s
    lifespan from the early design stage onwards. In the constructed environment,
    this pillar indorses the use of renewable energy to influence construction. On
    the other side, the ‘Share’ pillar follows the extreme use of modules, products
    or resources during sharing systems or give and take platforms. As for the ‘Optimize’
    pillar, it is more related to improving the efficiency and the functioning of
    the product, automation and distance sensing and so as eliminating the excesses
    in the production. Regarding the ‘Loop’ pillar, it has four core goals, which
    are as follows: to reuse material, to remove biochemical from biological excesses,
    to abstract excesses anaerobically and to obtain the production of modules and
    products. One of the other pillars ‘Virtualise’ concentrates on two kinds of dematerialization,
    which are direct and indirect dematerialization. The preceding pillar is ‘Exchange’
    pillar which has three main categories including new technologies; innovation
    by choosing new goods or services; or the replacement of old materials with new

    Blockchain intends to prompt the confidence of the stakeholders via its distributed

    as the reliable third-party authenticator of transactions. Since all the archived

- en: There exist a complex link and massive possibility of blockchain technology
    to positively contribute to the circular economy via sustainability and social
    responsibility plan. Blockchain is supporting applications in many sectors via
    its ability to enhance tracking. Blockchain implementation is analysed in several
    sectors and how it is aligned with social responsibility and sustainability matters.
    The analysis reveals that blockchain plays a role in the circular economy via
    its decentralization, ability to distribute with high security features. Moreover,
    the same analysis reveals that blockchain participates in the circular economy
    through aiding to decrease the transaction cost, improves performance and communication
    along the chain of supply and makes sure that the human rights are protected.
    Furthermore, it improves the confidentiality and welfare of the patients in the
    health care and decreases the carbon footprint. There is a possible upfront cost
    intricate in the implementation of blockchain technology, even though the benefits
    are more likely to outweigh the challenges. According to a study, a narrative
    review approach was adopted to collect two relatively new fields of study. Yet,
    taking into consideration the exponential rate at which the studies related to
    blockchain are prepared and published, more reviews would benefit from a more
    quantitative perspective. There are several articles examining how blockchain
    technology can play a role in the circular economy. Furthermore, there is a shortage
    of studies emphasizing on social responsibility within the circular economy model.
    In addition, regulation in diverse countries is most probably going to impact
    the growth and implementation of the blockchain. More studies on the policies
    and regulatory implication for blockchain and circular economy development along
    with studies related to developing countries with challenges in their infrastructures
    are recommended [[3](#CR3)].
