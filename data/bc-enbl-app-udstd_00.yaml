    Andrew for their patience during the extended hours and effort while putting the
    book together and colleagues and students at UCF and through the NSF I-Corps program
    that identified the power of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology years ago and shared
    their knowledge and future strategies that inspired us to pursue this area of
    research early. Thank you to my coauthors and our outside collaborators and contributors,
    and of course to God for the wisdom, ability and grit to bring this effort to
    life.Max Hooper would like to thank his co-authors and colleagues at UCF/METIL
    Lab, along with special thanks to Mindy Hooper for her help and support. Additionally,
    for God''s inspiration, guidance, direction and wisdom, I would like to acknowledge
    His leadership.IntroductionBlockchain technology is poised to fundamentally change
    our online world. This is not some kind of miraculous, cure-all, money-making
    solution. One specific use of blockchain such as Bitcoin, but rather the fundamental
    shift for the offline world ushered in by the web with easy to use access to information
    and the ability to make digital copies of data or content in an unprecedented
    ease for distribution across the globe. Hence the name, the World Wide Web. That
    interconnectivity has suffered fundamental problems when it comes to transactions
    - TRUST.The fundamental shift that blockchain technology represents is a method
    for moving away from an attempt to have a central trusted authority in a massively
    distributed network. But instead to have multiple sources of trust that must all
    agree, based on an algorithm that this transaction can be trusted as valid. Furthermore,
    most blockchain solutions offer an immutable and enduring record of a transaction
    as it is hard for any trusted or untrusted source to change or modify. This presents
    a completely new level of security, privacy, and TRUST to our online world. As
    you will see throughout this book, a variety of uses, protocols, and standards
    make up the current blockchain ecosystem.We also strive to strike the perfect
    balance between being a technical reference and a how-to handbook that shows practical
    examples of both current and future state use cases. While not comprehensive,
    we do select for several high promise areas where blockchain technology is beginning
    to enable applications for an entirely new industry segment. We hope this book
    will inform you and provides a roadmap to your success leveraging blockchain technology
    to enable new applications for your business.Throughout the book, you will see
    many examples of applications to reinforce key points. Early examples extend beyond
    financial transactions to cover other aspects of FinTech, RegTech (regulation),
    InsuranceTech, GovTech (eVoting, licensing, records and certification), HealthTech,
    and many others.In order to understand these early examples, it is necessary to
    explore the Blockchain history; fundamentals of distributed trust; consensus;
    hardware, software and encryption in the early chapters. Next, you’ll learn about
    the network transactions and simplified payments in Blockchain fundamentals. We’ll
    compare this with the extended capabilities if Ethereum and specific characteristics
    like how gas works and distributed apps along with examples of Blockchain as a
    Service. To further extend these capabilities, two chapters are devoted to DAO/Decentralized
    Organizations and the details and examples in these areas. In Chapter [7](A430562_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml)
    , Ethereum Tokens are highlighted for value creation with various technology and
    business sector examples that highlight the power of Smart Contracts to allow
    multiple sources of value and rules to be embedded in the transactions directly.
    The next three chapters- [8](A430562_1_En_8_Chapter.xhtml) , [9](A430562_1_En_9_Chapter.xhtml)
    and [10](A430562_1_En_10_Chapter.xhtml) segment examples into Blockchain in Science,
    Blockchain in Healthcare, and details on the structure of the Hyperledger Project,
    respectively. The final two chapters, [11](A430562_1_En_11_Chapter.xhtml) and
    [12](A430562_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml) explore many recent developments and future
    trends, particularly in ICOs and the effect on financial markets and processes.
    Don’t miss the late-breaking Appendix with a detailed interview with the Hashed
    Health leadership team and their insights on Blockchain in Healthcare. We hope
    you find the information in this book useful as well as enjoyable as you explore
    The fundamentals, current best practices and future potential of Blockchain Enabled
    Applications. We welcome your feedback at info@metil.org .AcknowledgmentsThe authors

    a research fellow in the Institute of Simulation and Training at the University
    of Central Florida where he studies the integration of emerging technologies into
    existing infrastructure. The focus of his recent work has been on decentralized
    ledger technologies. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Molecular Biology
    from the University of Central Florida, where his focus was bioinformatics. Currently,
    he is a DO-MBA candidate at the College of Medicine, Nova Southeastern University.
    He is the author of several scientific papers in computational genomics and two
    books, the most recent one on blockchain enabled applications. He has also written
    in-depth articles for the Bitcoin Magazine and letters for the New York Times.
    He was previously funded by the National Science Foundation through the Innovation
    Corps program to study customer discovery and apply it to commercialize high-risk
    startup ideas. He is a member of the Linux Foundation and has been active in open
    source projects and initiatives for the past several years. He often speaks at
    local conferences and meetups about programming, design, security, and entrepreneurship.

    blog at opsbug.com .David Metcalfhas more than 20 years of experience in the design
    and research of Web-based and mobile technologies converging to enable learning
    and health care. Dr. Metcalf is Director of the Mixed Emerging Technology Integration
    Lab (METIL) at UCF’s Institute for Simulation and Training. The team has built
    mHealth solutions, simulations, games, eLearning, mobile and enterprise IT systems
    for Google, J&J, the Veterans Administration, U.S. military, and the UCF College
    of Medicine among others. Recent projects include Lake Nona’s Intelligent Home
    prototype and SignificantTechnology, a mobile-enabled online degree and eResource
    kit. Dr. Metcalf encourages spin-offs from the lab as part of the innovation process
    and has launched Moving Knowledge and several other for-profit and nonprofit ventures
    as examples. In addition to research and commercial investments, he supports social
    entrepreneurship in education and health. Dr. Metcalf continues to bridge the
    gap between corporate learning and simulation techniques and nonprofit and social
    entrepreneurship. Simulation, mobilization, mobile patient records and medical
    decision support systems, visualization systems, scalability models, secure mobile
    data communications, gaming, innovation management, and operational excellence
    are his current research topics. Dr. Metcalf frequently presents at industry and
    research events shaping business strategy and use of technology to improve learning,
    health, and human performance. He is the coeditor and author of Connected Health
