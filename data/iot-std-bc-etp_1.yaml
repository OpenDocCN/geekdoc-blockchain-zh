    zero tolerance toward downtime, errors, and safety. This is one of the core reasons
    why OT has always operated in a highly risk-averse manner. Another aspect of OT
    is that the machineries deployed at the factories cannot be upgraded or replaced
    at the same pace as IT systems, and these are the ones that will remain for years
    once purchased. This becomes a hurdle to deploy new innovative ideas on these
    machineries to make them more efficient. On the other hand, most of the machineries
    operate 24/7 and 365 days a year, and stopping these machineries for any desired
    upgrades or modification is an almost impossible task.

    uranium enrichment plant in Iran noticed that filters used to enrich uranium gas
    were failing at an unprecedented rate. The cause was a complete mystery, and Iranian
    technicians replaced the filters. Five months later, a seemingly unrelated event
    occurred. A computer security firm in Belarus was called in to troubleshoot a
    series of computers in Iran that were crashing and rebooting repeatedly. The researchers
    found a handful of malicious files on one of the systems and discovered the Stuxnet
    virus. Another more recent event occurred last year in Germany, where hackers
    used malware to gain access to the control system of a steel mill, which they
    disrupted to such a degree that it could not be shut down. Thankfully, there was

    inspection by the staff of airplanes. We have also seen Process Transformations
    in the customer experience, where Domino’s Pizza, for example, completely reimagined
    the notion of food ordering, with the introduction of “AnyWare” which allowed
    customers to order their meals from any device. This innovation increased customer
    convenience so much that it helped push the company to overtake Pizza Hut in sales.
    We have also seen that manufacturing companies have learned that traditional manufacturing
    management software, such as an MES platform, that relies on humans to input data
    cannot keep pace with a modern manufacturing environment. Every input by a person
    has a cost, whether that be a labor cost, a lost production cost, or an accuracy
    cost. By connecting software directly to sensors that measure production parameters
    (temperature, pressure, speed, off/on states, etc.) along with machinery outputs
    and RFID chips, enterprises can collect data and analyze them in real time, thereby
    allowing them to save millions of dollars with predictive maintenance.

    assets with other business entities or users. A clear example of an asset sharing
    model is the electric scooters that are now on the streets of the UK. IoT-connected
    devices combined with consumers’ pay-per-use for a product is the model that is
    getting more prevalent in the world. The organization sharing the asset can charge
    for the asset based on the usage, time for the usage, and nature of the usage,
    which is similar to the outcome business model. In this model, a customer rents
    assets, but whatever they do not use is then fed back into the system. Instead
    of renting out an equipment to one customer, with asset sharing the customer has
    the asset for a specific amount of time. In this way, the products are circulating
    the market quicker, and the product is benefitting from full utilization across
    several customers. This also determines how long the asset is lying idle and not
    in use. In this use case, rather than taking the asset and only paying for the
    time customers use it or the outputs, customers rent the asset for a set amount
    of time, and when they are finished, it is then passed on to the next customer.
    With an IoT system, the assets are connected to the Internet to ensure they are
    not stolen and can be easily tracked for usage and wear and tear.

    for ABC Retail, where a salesman can retrieve specific data about a customer,
    using which he can serve his customers better. As an example, customer A walks
    into the store and tells a salesman that he is looking for some new trousers and
    shoes. The salesman comes back in a few minutes with a few dark blue trousers
    and a few pointed black shoes which are exactly of the same size and favorite
    colors of customer A. This is not a magic. The salesman was able to do that because
    of the capabilities that ABC Retail has created under him. ABC Retail created
    a totally transparent supply chain capability where each salesman within ABC Retail
    has access to the past events and purchases of their customers. Based on these
    insights, the salesman in this specific example understood that customer A has
    got a new job. Based on the past one-year buying patterns, he also got to know
    customer A’s shoe and dress sizes and favorite colors, based on which he was able
    to track the right size and favorite color of customer A. This is the kind of
    customer experience we are talking about at ABC Retail that is enabled via technology.

    their abilities, without compromising the quality of services they provide. Today,

- en: Cost optimization is one of the drivers enterprises consider for digital transformation,
    and indeed IoT is playing a major role. However, it is important to understand
    that the digital transformation journey should not be embarked just for optimizing
    costs in an enterprise. Digital transformation journeys are embarked by a need
    for enterprises to do business differently and adapt to any changing business
    needs in the most agile way. Business transformation means changing the way enterprises
    interact with their customers or businesses and at the same time improving operations

    pursuing large-scale change efforts to capture the benefits of these trends or
    simply to survive in the market. It is critical to embrace the dynamic landscape,
    as new economic opportunities are continually opening for organizations that need
    to quickly build and scale robust environments. Transforming the entire operations
    of an enterprise is extremely complex and can present a significant risk if not
    executed correctly. Without the right guidance and experience, it is all too easy
    to focus purely on technology adoption to drive the successful implementation
    of digital transformation strategy, overlooking the impact the changes will have
    on the rest of the organization. The result is high implementation costs, missed
    project deadlines, and an inability to see a return on investment. The concepts
    laid out in this book provide enterprises with the knowledge and direction necessary
    to achieve the business strategy by leading technology transformation using IoT.

- en: A digital transformation journey is a top-down rather than a bottom-up approach

    What this means is that digital transformation should be embarked by utilizing
    a well-defined enterprise-level digital transformation methodology. Without an
    enterprise-level methodology, enterprises cannot succeed in their efforts toward
    digital transformation, and IoT Standards addresses just this. IoT Standards is
    an enterprise-wide digital transformation model that empowers all types of organizations
    to embark on digital transformation journeys using IoT, thereby allowing enterprises
    to achieve the full benefits of digital at scale by first understanding the business
    drivers behind the transformation and then enabling transformation using IoT.
    The results of IoT Standards implementation are achieving greater alignment and

    cost and complexity are placed in the Hot zone. These are use cases that can be
    implemented for faster business results and are ideal candidates for pilots. My
    advice for young enterprises (less than 15 years in business) is to first implement
    use cases in the Hot zone to gain faster business and board confidence on the
    success that IoT can generate to their business. Use cases which have high impact
    on the business strategy but come with high implementation cost and complexity
    are placed in the Warm zone. For large or legacy enterprises, a combination of
    use cases in Hot and Warm zones is recommended for implementation to gain business
    and board confidence on the success of IoT to their business. This is because
    for large enterprises, there will be very limited use cases that can fit into
    the Hot zone.

- en: Many companies become frustrated when they do not see early signs of transformative
    impact from an IoT pilot. We all need to understand that a single use case just
    would not prove the benefits of IoT. It has to be implemented at scale both in
    terms of the number of use cases and the breadth to demonstrate the impact. More
    widespread implementation of IoT use cases forces a cultural shift and provides
    new perspectives to the board and business on the benefits of IoT. In a ripple
    effect, this momentum often also exposes weakness in technology along with gaps
    in talent, both in terms of in-house IoT skill levels and the numbers of experts
    needed to implement IoT at scale. The “go big” approach may seem counterintuitive,
    particularly among enterprises that have fewer resources to deploy and feel more
    comfortable focusing on a small number of use cases. While a smaller scale may
    be good for very early days, there is a clear learning curve that companies achieve
    as they add use cases, and the sooner the learnings are achieved, the better it
    is for the enterprise. I have personally experienced that a greater number of
    use cases correlate with economic success regardless of the use case or type of
    company.

    the board level executives supported me when I realized and told them that the
    IoT deployment strategy which we originally designed is not bold enough. We initially
    decided to deploy IoT with six use cases (called minimum viable products  or MVPs
    in this organization) from the Hot zone, but soon I realized that this narrow
    focus will not improve performance as much as expected, neither will we be able
    to achieve the outcomes that the board will appreciate. A few leaders from across
    the enterprise pushed against voices of caution and expanded the number of MVPs
    to 15, and we went to an extent to select a few MVPs from the Warm zone. Executives
    also found that giving managers a larger number of IoT use cases to oversee focused
    their attention on creating a bias to make IoT a success. That momentum built
    on itself as the company’s best talent wanted to be part of the innovative push
    using IoT. A strong base of 21 IoT scrum teams was formed for these 15 MVPs which
    helped loosen bureaucratic decision-making rules. Finally, unexpected efficiencies
    turned up as engineers were able to reuse similar data architectures for multiple
    MVPs and found numerous synergies with each other. At the end, such an aggressive
    IoT use case strategy produced new revenue streams as well as improved the business
    process efficiencies between 60% and 80% and reduced costs between 28% and 67%
