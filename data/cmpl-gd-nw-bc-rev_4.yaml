- en: While blockchain is poised to do a great many different things in the near future,
    for now, the most important thing you will want to keep in mind is that blockchains
    make cryptocurrency possible. Bitcoin jumped in price to more than $19,000 during
    2017\. While this price has pushed it out of the league of many amateur investors,
    there are more than 1,000 different cryptocurrencies on the market these days,
    so there are plenty of opportunities out there for those who are interested in
    a potentially profitable investment. This is not to say that there isn’t risk
    involved as well, however; it is important to keep the risks of cryptocurrency
    investment in mind as well before making any investments in the space.

  zh: 虽然区块链在未来可能会做很多不同的事情，但现在，您需要记住的最重要的事情是，区块链使加密货币成为可能。比特币在2017年的价格飙升超过19,000美元。尽管这个价格使它超出了许多业余投资者的行列，但现在市场上有很多不同的加密货币，所以对于那些对潜在有利可图的投资感兴趣的人来说，有很多机会。然而，这并不意味着没有风险涉及；在进入该领域之前，记住加密货币投资的风险是很重要的。

- en: As cryptocurrencies are an all-digital currency, this means there is less likelihood
    of fraud taking place around them; they cannot be counterfeited, and there is
    no way for one member of the transaction to reverse it once a transaction has
    taken place.

- en: Currently, there are three billion people in the world who have access to the
    internet but do not have regular access to any form of exchange. This leaves the
    cryptocurrency market with a lot of room to maneuver, and it is expected to see
    significant growth as it gains wider acceptance. This means that an increasing
    amount of business will take place purely through digital currencies, which means
    those who invest in cryptocurrency now aren’t just likely to see an increase;
    they are likely to see a dramatic increase.

  zh: 目前，全球有30亿人可以访问互联网但没有定期访问任何形式的交易所。这使得加密货币市场有很大的操作空间，随着更广泛的接受，预计将看到显著增长。这意味着越来越多的业务将纯粹通过数字货币进行，这意味着现在投资加密货币的人不仅可能会看到增长；他们可能会看到剧烈的增长。

- en: Once you have bought into a cryptocurrency, there is less chance that you will
    have to worry about identity theft than when working with traditional online exchanges.
    This is a concern in traditional instances, as credit or debit cards are charged
    with each new transaction, which means that there is a far greater opportunity
    for identity thieves to find a way to crack the system and make off with personal
    information.

  zh: 一旦你购买了加密货币，你担心身份盗窃的可能性会比你使用传统在线交易所时要低。在传统情况下这是一个担忧，因为每次新交易都会对信用卡或借记卡收费，这意味着身份盗贼有更大的机会找到破解系统的方法并窃取个人信息。

- en: While Bitcoin has proved to be a winning investment for the past eight years,
    and Ethereum has grown year over year since its inception, despite some down times
    in-between, that doesn’t mean that this will continue to be the case in the long-term.
    There simply not enough past data to say with any real degree of certainty what
    the market will look like in a year from now, much less 5 or 10, which means that
    both the potential for loss and the potential for gain are virtually limitless.
    Basically, what this means is that up until the time that the cryptocurrency market
    stabilizes, any dollar you put into Ethereum is just as likely to be worth more
    next year than it is today as it is to be completely worthless.

  zh: 虽然比特币在过去八年里被证明是一项成功的投资，以太坊自成立以来每年都在增长，尽管期间有些下跌，但这并不意味着长期来看情况会是这样。过去的数据不够多，无法确切地说市场在未来一年或五年、十年后会是什么样子，这意味着潜在的损失和潜在的收益几乎是无限的。基本上，这意味着在加密货币市场稳定之前，你投入以太坊的每一美元，明年可能比今天更有价值，也可能完全一文不值。

  zh: 完全数字化
- en: While the digital nature of cryptocurrency is often touted as a positive, it
    is important to consider its negative aspects as well. For example, as a purely
    digital construct, if you were keeping your cryptocurrency in an exchange that
    had a server error that resulted in a loss of all its backup drives, what would
    happen to your currency then? Likewise, what were to happen if you put your coins
    into a physical wallet that then stopped reading on your computer?
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 虽然加密货币的数字化经常被吹捧为一种积极因素，但考虑其负面影响也同样重要。例如，作为一种纯粹的数字化构件，如果你的加密货币储存在一个由于服务器错误而丢失所有备份驱动器的交易所里，你的货币会发生什么？同样，如果你把你的硬币放进一个然后在电脑上无法读取的实体钱包里又会怎样？
- en: Both of these cases are unlikely to happen, but if they were, then your cryptocurrency
    would be gone as if it had never existed in the first place. Furthermore, the
    massive potential for profits means that hackers are never going to stop trying
    to access these exchanges, so eventually, they will succeed. When investing in
    cryptocurrency, it is important to value security as highly as possible because
    there is very little standing between your investments and the void.

  zh: 这两种情况都不太可能发生，但如果它们发生了，那么你的加密货币就会消失，就像它从未存在过一样。此外，巨大的利润潜力意味着黑客永远不会停止尝试访问这些交易所，所以最终他们肯定会成功。在投资加密货币时，重视安全至关重要，因为几乎没有什么能保护你的投资不受损失。

  zh: 极度波动
- en: While bitcoin can be thought of as the most stable cryptocurrency, it is still
    six times as volatile than investing in the S&P 500 and five times as volatile
    as investing in gold. While this means there is an increased chance of profit,
    it also means there is an increased chance for risk as well. A vast majority of
    all cryptocurrency transactions are currently speculative in nature, which means
    that investors are buying and holding them. This, in turn, creates a bubble that
    has to eventually burst sooner or later. The trick with the bubble is to get in
    as early as possible and keep an eye out for signs that it will burst so you can
    get while the getting is good.

  zh: 尽管可以认为比特币是最稳定的加密货币，但它仍然比投资标普500的波动性高六倍，比投资黄金的波动性高五倍。这意味着虽然利润增加，风险也随之增加。目前绝大多数加密货币交易都是投机的，这意味着投资者正在买入并持有它们。这反过来又形成了一个泡沫，这个泡沫迟早会破裂。对于泡沫来说，关键是尽可能早地进入，并留心它何时会破裂，这样你才能在破裂前获利。

    the price is naturally going to be fairly limited. The opposite is true for cryptocurrencies,
    however, it is difficult to tell what will set investors off before it happens.
    Any currency news anywhere has the potential to set prices shifting dramatically;
    in fact, several of Bitcoin’s most significant moves have come about due to the
    introduction of controls for capital in Greece and when China devalued the Yuan.

- en: This can also be seen as a negative, depending on your tolerance for risk, as
    these factors can be enough to generate large swings on a daily basis. In fact,
    price shifts of more than 5 percent are common on most days for the larger cryptocurrencies,
    and the smaller ones aren’t surprised if they see 15 percent movement or more.

    anywhere can lead to essentially unexpected movement, all combine to create an
    extremely volatile market. Swings of more than 5 percent in a single day are not
    uncommon for several different types of cryptocurrency, and the smaller currencies
    are capable of swinging with even greater frequency and to larger degrees.

    to improving the quality of the blockchain experience as a whole is Ethereum.
    While its cryptocurrency, ether, sees a fair amount of speculation, it is mainly
    used to pay for transactions with smart contracts and applications designed to
    run on the Ethereum platform. It has already seen about half as many transactions
    as Bitcoin, despite only being around for a third of the time. It is also more
    firmly focused on the future, with its improved interactions with smart contracts
    and its decentralized app platform, as well.

- en: Perhaps more importantly, if you look at the transaction chart for Bitcoin,

- en: The final feather in ether’s cap is the fact that the Ethereum blockchain is
    all done on smart contract technology. Smart contracts are simple programs that
    can be added to blocks and then activated once a specific set of circumstances
    occur. While they are currently primarily being used for financial purposes, there
    is already interest in them for everything from monitoring patients in hospitals
    to providing notary services. In fact, one of the stated goals of Ethereum is
    to simplify the way that traditional contracts work, thus reducing the costs of
    such services significantly.

- en: The Ethereum platform can process a total of 25 transactions per second, though
    additional scalability is also possible. This process can lead to additional orphaned
