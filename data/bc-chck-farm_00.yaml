    worms that roil and roll along white ceramic tile. A child’s socks and underwear
    are hung out to dry on a small rack next to the sink. It’s been raining all day.
    I’m in a small village in southern China, at the border of Jiangxi and Guangdong.
    I arrived in the village to try to understand how e-commerce has affected life
    here, with farmers selling goods directly to consumers, using WeChat’s robust
    mobile payment system. After missing the last bus back to the nearest city, I
    am now on an involuntary meditation retreat.

  zh: 今晚，我站在洗手间刷牙，四周都是几十条针尖大小的黑色蠕虫，它们在白色的陶瓷瓷砖上翻滚。一个孩子的袜子和内衣挂在洗手池旁的小衣架上晾晒着。今天一整天都在下雨。我在中国南方的一个小村庄，位于江西和广东的交界处。我来到这个村庄是为了试图了解电子商务是如何影响这里的生活的，农民直接向消费者出售商品，使用微信强大的移动支付系统。由于错过了回到最近城市的最后一班公交车，我现在被迫进行一次闭门静思。
- en: Since I’m American, my hosts have assumed I need spacious, extraordinarily comfortable
    conditions, which is why I’m staying at the most modern house in the village,
    by myself. It’s a two-story concrete building with an outhouse that has a ceramic
    squat toilet, just a few convenient steps away from the front door.

    a small plastic space heater that defeatedly wheezes lukewarm air. It’s the only

    I am unused to this kind of solitude, as someone who spends most of my time in
    cities, and I am scared—stuck in a new place with only the worms to talk to, maybe
    a ghost or two, replaying supernatural horror movies in my mind. Without the stimulation
    of light and sound, my mind turns over thoughts and stories on repeat, revisiting
    inconsequentially boring past moments like a mantra: Did Xinghai think I was a
    jerk because I didn’t say thank you earlier when he dropped me off? Did I end
    my e-mail to Gu in the wrong tone? What if I get stuck in this village forever?

    a night-light app on my phone after scrolling through pages of App Store reviews.'

- en: I felt the pull of rural China about three years ago, after visiting villages
    in Guizhou, seeing a side of China very different from the one portrayed in most
    forms of media. This pull was amplified by my need to challenge my own *metronormativity*—a
    portmanteau of “metropolitan” and “normative,” coined by the theorist and scholar
    Jack Halberstam.

  zh: 大约三年前，我被中国的乡村吸引住了，这是在贵州的村庄之后，看到了与大多数媒体呈现的中国形象截然不同的一面。我的这种吸引力被我挑战自己的*都市规范性*强化了，这是理论家、学者杰克·哈尔伯斯塔姆创造的词语，由“都市”和“规范性”组成。
- en: Metronormativity is pervasive—it’s the normative, standard idea that somehow
    rural culture and rural people are backward, conservative, and intolerant, and
    that the only way to live with freedom is to leave the countryside for highly
    connected urban oases. Metronormativity fuels the notion that the internet, technology,
    and media literacy will somehow “save” or “educate” rural people, either by allowing
    them to experience the broader world, offering new livelihoods, or reducing misinformation.

  zh: 都市规范是无处不在的——它认为农村文化和农村人民都很落后、保守和不包容，而自由生活的唯一方法就是离开乡村去高度联系的都市绿洲。都市规范助长了这样一种观念，认为互联网、技术和媒体素养将以某种方式“拯救”或“教育”农村人，要么让他们接触到更广阔的世界，要么提供新的生计，或者减少误导信息。
- en: For me, challenging this metronormativity is crucial. So much of the extended
    crises and the rise of authoritarian populism throughout the world has been a
    result of globalization. The urban-rural dynamic is central to globalization,
    with rural areas serving as the engine, the site of extractive industries from
    industrial agriculture to rare earth mining. I believe our ability to confront
    metronormativity will determine our shared future. We are intertwined across cities,
    villages, and national boundaries, bound by material circumstance.

  zh: 对我来说，挑战这种都市规范至关重要。全世界范围内延续的危机和威权民粹主义的崛起很大程度上是全球化的结果。城乡动态对全球化至关重要，农村地区成为了抽取性产业的发动机所在，从工业农业到稀土矿业。我相信我们对抗都市规范的能力将决定我们共同的未来。我们在城市、乡村和国界上面互相联系，受物质环境所约束。
- en: I have traveled to rare earth and copper mines in Inner Mongolia, driven along
    dusty highways past wind turbines and data centers, visited villages where artificial
    intelligence training data is made, and seen empty villages where all the young
    people have left for electronics factory jobs in cities. Rather than seeing the
    way technology has shifted or produced new livelihoods in rural China, I have
    been humbled to see the ways rural China fuels the technology we use every day,
    around the world.

- en: Questioning metronormativity means demanding something outside the strict binaries
    of rural versus urban, natural versus man-made, digital versus physical, and remote
    as disengaged versus metropolitan as connected. To question metronormativity demands
    a vision of living that serves life itself, and not just life in cities. Embarking

- en: The dynamics of rural China are not isolated to China itself. Yet because of
    its geographic distance from the United States, it remains a kind of periphery.
    These rural peripheries, the edges of the world, hidden from view, enable our
    existence in cities. These areas produce everything from the cotton in the clothes
    we wear to the minerals that create the computers in data centers. They also produce
    the food we eat. It is impossible to disentangle the countryside from food—food
    is at the core of the dynamic between the rural and the global. As humans, we
    eat to survive, and our appetite for food has carved new geographies and technologies
    into the world. Urbanite appetites, especially, have shifted rural economies,
    ecologies, and societies over the past three decades.

- en: I have a difficult time grasping the full dynamics of complex concepts like
    climate change, which creates economic and ecological relationships at a dizzying
    array of scales throughout the world. Yet agriculture and what we eat are tangible
    manifestations of these entangled global issues that affect all of us. According
    to a recent United Nations report, a third of human greenhouse gas emissions stem
    from industrial agricultural practices. These same industrial agriculture practices
    have rearranged the way rural communities live, fomenting political change around

- en: Conducting research in rural China meant that I could, selfishly, return to
    villages that I love being in. There was an allure to living at a pace and scale
    that felt comprehensible, to living in a place that felt grounded. It is easy
    to romanticize rural Chinese villages as idyllic scenes of nature, small and disengaged—yet
    many of them are sites of economies and agricultural practices that are foundational
    to our world. And as numerous historians, such as Robert Brenner and Sue Headlee,
    have shown, shifts in agriculture and rural politics were crucial for the transition
    into industrialization and capitalism throughout the world. In thinking through
    agriculture, through a sense of place and belonging, I was influenced by the writings
    of bell hooks and Wendell Berry, for whom being and belonging acquire a sense
    of urgency—especially in a political and economic system that dislocates people
    from place and community. It would have been easy to attribute the loss of belonging,
    of place, to just technology accelerating us into the singularity of despondency.
    But challenging my metronormativity meant challenging these ideas of the digital
    world versus the physical world, and pulling back the idea that becoming a Luddite
    and disengaging is the only way to reclaim a sense of belonging.

  zh: 在中国农村进行研究意味着我可以自私地回到我喜欢的村庄。以一种感知到的节奏和规模生活，住在一个感觉真实的地方有着无法抗拒的诱惑。很容易将中国农村村庄浪漫化为天然的田园风光，小而与外界脱节，然而其中许多地方是我们世界根基性的经济和农业实践的场所。正如许多历史学家所示，比如罗伯特·布伦纳和苏·海德利，农业和农村政治的转变对全球工业化和资本主义的转型至关重要。在思考农业，思考归属和归属感时，我受到贝尔·胡克斯和温德尔·贝里的著作的影响，对他们来说，存在和归属感显得格外紧迫，尤其是在一个旧的政治和经济体系将人们从地方和社区中分离出来的情况下。很容易将归属感和地方失去归因于科技将我们加速推入绝望的境地。但挑战我的节拍正常化意味着挑战这些数字世界与物理世界的观念，并推翻成为卢德派和脱离的想法是重新获得归属感的唯一途径。
- en: '“Why are you here?” I am here because looking at technology in rural China,
    in places that produce the technology we use, places that show how globally entangled
    we are with one another, allows me to confront the scarier question that technology
    poses: What does it mean to live, to be human right now? Looking at tech in rural
    China forced me to examine the ideologies that drive engineers and companies to
    build everything from AI farming systems and blockchain food projects to shopping
    sites and payment platforms. These assumptions about humans and the way the world
    *should* work are more powerful than sheer technical curiosity in driving the
    creation of new technologies and platforms. Embedded in these tools are their
    makers’ and builders’ assumptions about what humans need, and how humans *should*
    interact. It is not enough to critique these assumptions, because in simply critiquing,
    we remain caught in the long list of binaries: Tech is dehumanizing, tech brings
    liberation. Tech dragged the world into the mess it’s in, tech frees it from this
    mess. Tech creates isolation, tech connects marginalized communities. The difficult
    work that we face is to live and thrive beyond binaries and assumptions, and to
    aid and enable others to do so. How do we begin this work?'

- en: 'At the age of ninety-five, five years before her death, the activist Grace
    Lee Boggs wrote *The Next American Revolution*. Published in 2010, the book sounded
    an alarm bell for our present condition—a time when politics was no longer politics
    as usual, where traditional forms of protest were not enough to induce change,
    and when ecological disaster wrought by unfettered material and technological
    growth was looming. Despite all this, she pointed to a source of hope: “the great
    turning.” The great turning, a term borrowed from Buddhism, refers to a growing
    tidal wave of people now taking the first step toward change: addressing spiritual
    impoverishment. “These are the times to grow our souls,” she writes. The way to
    respond to crisis is to practice compassion and change the cycle of suffering.
    We can all actively practice compassion in our own way, whether we are doctors,
    teachers, or businesspeople. Engineers and makers and builders of technology have
    this opportunity; I hope this book sparks something for you. After all, code is
    words made executable—we must take care in what we say. And for those of us who
    see code as an apocryphal text, who see technology as indeed accelerating us toward
    a despondent, tightly controlled world, I hope this book reaffirms the power that
    you hold in *being human*, and demonstrates ways certain technologies might actually
    serve open systems. To spark the great turning, we need to transform our compassion,
    our imagination, and our society—we cannot focus on reforming our technologies
    alone. Most of all, I hope that this book brings you to parts of China that you
    might never visit, takes you beyond a map of abstractions, a flat map made by
    metronormativity.'

  zh: 九十五岁时，激进主义者格雷斯·李·博格斯在去世前五年写下了《下一个美国革命》。这本书于2010年出版，为我们目前的状态敲响了警钟：这是一个政治已不再是一如既往的政治的时代，传统的抗议形式已不足以引发变革的时代，也是由放纵不受控制的物质和技术增长带来的生态灾难即将来临的时代。尽管如此，她指出了一丝希望：
    “重大转变”。重大转变，这个从佛教借来的术语指的是越来越多的人正在迈出迈向变革的第一步：解决精神贫困。她写道：“现在是培育我们灵魂的时候。” 应对危机的方法是练习同情心，改变痛苦的循环。我们每个人都可以以自己的方式积极地实践同情心，无论我们是医生、老师还是商人。技术的工程师、制造商和建造者有这个机会；我希望这本书能为你点燃一些火花。毕竟，代码是可执行的文字
