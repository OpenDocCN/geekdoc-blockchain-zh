    artificial intelligence will invariably lead to anxiety, stress, and potentially
    misunderstanding of just what these technologies represent for financial services.
    Blockchain, hopefully, at this point has been demystified to a certain extent,
    but the idea of artificial intelligence may appear and seem like a more amorphous
    concept that is both difficult to understand but potentially disruptive in nature.
    While artificial intelligence has been featured in numerous media outlets, movies,
    and T.V. shows, the image that is most often presented to audiences and market
    actors is one that, almost invariably, has negative connotations and implications
    for the developers and users. Fortunately, while there have been numerous advances
    in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence, the limits of
    current iterations are still substantial. In other words there is no need to fear
    the Terminator coming for financial practitioner roles. Prior to diving into what
    the applications and implications of AI may very well be, however, it seems appropriate
    to first put forward a definition that makes sense in the context of this discussion.
    Not meant to be overly technical, but rather a working definition to assist financial
    professionals seeking to understand and explain the implications of AI, a working
    definition as follows is a workable option:'

    and cryptocurrency may also be difficult to understand and appear to be a relatively
    new concept in and of itself, but even in spite of this initial confusion and
    analysis there are similarities between these technology tools and preexisting
    options. A decentralized ledger system, otherwise labeled as a decentralized ledger
    technology (DLT) platform is, of course, different from current centralized options,
    but underlying components can be related to tools like Excel and Access. Additionally,
    cryptocurrencies are simply a representation of how several technology tools and

    advising, financial planning, and charting an investment strategy to contend with
    different market forces have traditionally remained in the realm of individuals

    in the current marketplace. Drilling down, the sheer volume of information and
    data that is produced and generated by both organizations and the broader market
    dovetail exactly with the attributes of artificial intelligence. Analyzing large
    amounts of information, gleaning patterns and insights from quantitative information,
    and creating outputs and results as a result of these analyses link directly to
    what investment professionals are paid to do. Digesting market information, interpreting
    market trends and forces, and translating the bigger picture into investment advice

    on a combination of periodic quantitative examination, qualitative conversations

    analytical procedures to help answer additional questions arising during the process.
    While this model and process for auditing organizations has served numerous organizations,
    firms, and practitioners very well, there are substantial flaws that have been
    exploited time and again. The time lag, a primary points of concern, between when
    the information being audited was actually generated and when the data is tested

    it is increasingly clear that core functions of how accounting work will change
    over time. For example, if certain classes of information and data have been secured

    be leveraged to analyze these continuously increasing quantities of information,
    enabling the tools to augment rather than supplant human participants (Briggs

    data does not appear appropriate. Additionally, verifying the physical existence
    of assets, namely inventory, is an important part of any entry level auditors
    training and on-the-job experience, but may not add much in the way of value to
    the organization. On top of the financial impact that having an accurate count
    of inventory generates, it is also an area where fraud and other unethical activity
    has occurred with frightening occurrence. Better control, more up-to-date information
    linked both to inventory and the ramifications of inventory levels will, invariably,
    create opportunities for more efficient deployment of capital.

    24/7 信息时代和业务发生的加速化的情况下，依赖这种繁琐且耗时的流程来确认数据似乎不太合适。此外，验证资产的实际存在，特别是存货，是任何初级审计师培训和在职经验中的重要部分，但可能对组织的价值贡献不大。除了准确计算存货产生的财务影响外，诚实活动和其他不道德活动发生的地方也是一个令人恐惧的领域。更好的控制，与存货和存货水平相关的更及时的信息，必然会为更有效地配置资本创造机会。

    at least at the current moment, driven by various qualitative factors. When dealing
    with a global and digitized environment, complete with different streams of information
    coming into the organization, a rather obvious problem can become more pronounced.
    Every different technology system and platform, clearly, has data formatting protocols
    and systems that have been built around the needs of those individual users. This
    may make sense from a specific perspective, such for utilizing a unique system
    within an organization or arrangement of organizations, but when trying to transfer
    data between different firm or partner organizations this represents a substantial
    problem. Any professional who has ever spent time trying to manually format and

    attempting to correct these issues.

- en: In addition to absorbing the time and mental energy of different employees this
    also increases the time spent making decisions, which can cost organizations potential
    opportunities. Manually reconciling files and format types when performing a bank
    reconciliation might only take a few minutes, but for larger organizations, or
    with firms interacting with global counterparties, these reconciliations can add
    hours or days to the processing of information. Artificial intelligence tools
    and processes, by automating or being trained to translate and automate the translation
    and standardization, can – and already are – adding speed and efficiency to how
    data is processes and communicated. On the flip side, however, as the speed with
    which data is processed and communicated continues to increase and accelerate,
    it becomes even more important to establish internal controls over how data is
    handled. Controls may seem like an afterthought in a business environment where
    the improvement of technology is the primary conversation topic, but that does
    not mean it should be overlooked. Much like dominos can be arranged so that one
    can initiate a much larger cascading series of events, if bad information is entered
    into an AI-augmented or AI-driven process the ramifications of this bad data can
    quickly escalate out of control.

    key point to remember during this conversation is that, as computers become increasingly
    sophisticated there will also be drawbacks. As increasing amounts of trading are
    connected to computers, programs, and algorithms that operate without direct human
    oversight and intervention there is a possibility that large swings in the market

- en: First, while volatility while judged by historically levels, has been at low
    levels in the 2015–2018 time period this does not provide the entire picture.
    The decrease in volatility may not, as some has speculated, be associated with
    the increased efficiency generated by algorithmic trading programs, but rather
    a related trend. ETFs, passive investing tools, and the growing (trillions as
    of this writing) assets invested in these options may also be having an outsized
    impact on volatility and training patterns. Put simply, as larger and larger percentages
    of investors and funds are investing in similar, if not identical, trading tools
    and platforms, this may very well have a depressive impact on market volatility.
    This may very well seem like a positive effect to retail investors with jitters
    linked to increases in market volatility, but masks an underlying problem. If
    investing decisions are made outside of human oversight and supervision this can
    inadvertently lead to market selloffs, runoffs, and other actions that do not

    forms a plurality of work performed by many accounting professionals and a way
    that professionals can quantitatively add value to the organization. Despite of
    this, one of the key issues raised and problems associated with internal management
    reporting, or ad hoc reporting, is that data is not generated consistently, systems
    do not communicate with each other, and there are inevitably time lags between
    when different classes of information are generated. Even worse, in the context
    of accounting professionals seeking to elevate both themselves and the work performed
    internally, the amount of time spent correcting errors, manually adjusting entries
    and information deprives professionals of the time necessary to instead focus

- en: This chapter focuses on a topic and idea that is simultaneously discussed very
    often, but is also one of the most misunderstood ideas on the emerging technology
    spectrum; artificial intelligence. A key point for practitioners to understand
    is that, even if they themselves of their organizations are not particularly interested
    in using artificial intelligence for business purposes at this point in time is
    that clients and customers are potentially already doing so. Drilling down specifically
    to the topics covered in this text, practitioners need to be able to understand
    and communicate the reality that there are different classes of intelligence that
    may be applicable to different industry lines. To that end, this chapter also
    breaks down the different types of artificial intelligence that are available
    in the marketplace at this point in time. Clearly not an all-inclusive listing
    or analysis of the types of artificial intelligence that exist, the types of intelligence
    documented within this chapter should instead serve as an appropriate jumping
    off point for future conversations and analyses. Additionally, and applicable
    for all users and readers of this text and associated materials is the differentiation
    between AI, RPA, and other automation tools that are currently available and in
    use by practitioners. Understanding what artificial intelligence means from both
    a technical and application perspective will be important not only in the current
    marketplace but as well as the future as automation moves from emerging topics
    idea to mainstream business practice.
