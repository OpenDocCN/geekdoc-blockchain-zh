- en: Integrated reporting, at the basis of the idea, is a comprehensive reporting
    framework that reflects both the increasing interest from stakeholders in understanding
    both how an organization generates results, but also how these results are created
    (Zhou et al. [2017](#CR8)). Without diving too much into the technical weeds and
    details associated with integrated reporting, it can be summarized as a methodology
    to report financial and operational data to external stakeholders. The core of
    this reporting framework, which has been adopted by a variety of organizations
    across industry lines on an international basis, can be summarized and highlighted
    via the multiple capital model. Even the name of the multiple capital model itself
    appears to connect the concept of more comprehensive reporting to the financial
    services profession, and includes a wide variety of information. Drilling down
    into the multiple capital model itself is logical, both from a tactical approach
    for financial services professionals as well as a strategic headset (Fig. [14.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_14_Chapter/467992_1_En_14_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_14_Chapter/467992_1_En_14_Fig1_HTML.png)

    however, it appears important to acknowledge just what exactly such a framework
    may very well mean for accounting and finance professionals moving forward. Traditionally,
    the view of capital is something akin to a simplistic model only connected to
    the financial resources and assets at the disposal of the management team. While
    such a perspective and view point appears logical in nature, especially with the
    emphasis placed on meeting quarterly earnings targets by the marketplace, that
    generates an incomplete view of just how organizations are increasingly evaluated.
    Even sticking to the evidence offered by financial assets, records, and news updates
    it does appear logical to conclude that there is a growing interest in the following
    two forces, or rather a differentiated emphasis on what these two forces mean
    in the current market landscape (Avery [2017](#CR1)).

  zh: 但在进一步研究多元资本模型的各个组成部分之前，承认这样一个框架对于财会和金融专业人员未来的意义似乎是很重要的。 传统上，资本的观点类似于只与管理团队的财务资源和资产相关联的一个简单模型。虽然这样的观点和观点在本质上似乎是合理的，特别是市场强调满足季度盈利目标时，这产生了一个对组织如何被评估的不完整观点。即使仅仅依据财务资产、记录和新闻更新所提供的证据，似乎可以得出结论，对以下两个力量越来越感兴趣，或者更确切地说是对这两个力量在当前市场格局中意味着什么进行了更多的强调（Avery
    [2017](#CR1)）。
- en: Financial results are, clearly, the basis by which organizations and management
    teams are usually evaluated, but that is only part of the story, as any well educated
    and experienced financial services professional realizes. Specifically, the sustainability
    of operations, including but not limited individual sustainability projects but
    also the ability of the organization to generate results on a continuous basis,
    are both of interest to financial and nonfinancial stakeholders. Taking this into
    account, the development of more comprehensive and robust frameworks to fulfill
    the needs of end users appears logical (Moy Huber and Comstock [2017](#CR6)).
    While no reporting framework or methodology of doing business will ever be foolproof,
    nor address every possible contingency, the shift toward integrated reporting
    is a logical first step. Technology will invariably assist with this process,
    the more continuous and comprehensive reporting of data to end users, but it is
    also important to understand the underlying fundamentals, and be able to compare
    the data that is reported by any single organization to other comparable organizations
    (Chender [2019](#CR2)). Stated another way, while tools such as AI and blockchain
    may very well assist in the gathering and analysis of different types of information,
    financial professionals will need to understand both the technology and the underlying
    concepts in order to effectively advocate for, and lead, the necessary changes
    to keep pace with evolving market expectations.

    Huber and Comstock [2017](#CR6)）。虽然任何报告框架或从事商业的方法永远不会是绝对可靠的，也不能涵盖一切可能发生的情况, 但向集成报告的转变是一个合理的第一步。技术必定会协助这一过程，更连续和全面地向最终用户报告数据，但理解基础原理并能够比较任何单个组织所报告的数据与其他可比组织的数据同样重要（Chender

    times throughout this book, but that is because an industry such as insurance
    is almost tailor made for blockchain implementation. At the core of the idea of
    insurance is that it is a series of contracts and agreements made between unrelated
    parties or institutions that entitles one party (the insurer) to consistent compensation
    to finance payouts that the other party (the customers) is entitled to if certain
    conditions are met. In addition to the fiduciary duty that is embodied in any
    financial institution in charge of managing funds on behalf of others, insurance
    contracts and organizations also must deal with a fundamental lack of trust involved
    in the underlying business process. While fraud represents a relatively small
    percentage of total claims filed on an annual basis, the total amount estimated
    to be paid out in fraudulent claims totaled billions of dollars during the last
    several years. On top of the obvious financial implications and bottom line costs

    contamination, poor communication, and the lack of ability to trace back goods
    and good services back to the point of origin represent clear issues that must
    be addressed going forward. This also represents an intersection between how technology
    forces may be driving innovation directly with the financial services profession
    as well as being driven by implications and applications outside of the finance
    space. In the U.S. alone the food and restaurant industry is worth billions and

    market for advisory work in this space is significant.

    so. Specifically, the sharing of information and data between different stakeholder
    groups may be common in some situations – such as between Walmart and suppliers –
    but may not be common between other firms and suppliers. Layering blockchain solutions
    and protocols on top of and alongside current technology solutions such as RFID
    and EDI may seem contrary to the underlying promise of blockchain technology,
    but upon further reflection is apparently logical. This raises another issue that
    must be addressed during any consultative engagement; the reality that organizations
    have already invested millions – if not billions – in developing and maintaining
    current technology solutions. Introducing blockchain as a complementary and incremental
    solution, especially at first, may help lessen and reduce the potential push back
