    how information is approved, verified, and added to existing blocks to form the

    over ten million members as of 2018\. The size of the network itself, however,

    size and data verification method that can complicate the utilization process.

    compared to the amount of data that can be processed or approved by existing credit
    card and other financial intermediaries, the significant short comings of Bitcoin
    as a tool for purchasing becomes apparent. In addition to not being as efficient
    or as fast as existing approval methodologies, the proof of work methodology utilized
    by the Bitcoin blockchain has two other issues worthy of note. First, the sheer
    amount of computing power and servers required to process and confirm different
    transactions and information means that, as the blockchain becomes larger, ever
    larger and more complex computing power is necessary to become a proactive part
    of the network. Second, and on top of the array of computing power and infrastructure

    also means, that in addition to being more efficient and practical for business
    use, a private blockchain may actually be a more environmentally conscious option.
    Since, as a result of the oversight of the organizing firm, any approval and verification

    and operating of the blockchain model creates several benefits in terms of information
    transparency, but also raises issues connected to data governance as well as liability
    concerns as well. Especially as it links to personally identifiable information
    the responsibility is increasing shifting to the organization collecting and utilizing
    this information to establish and maintain safeguards over access to this information.
    Despite the operational and potential privacy driven challenges linked with this

    a consortium model of blockchain development and operation does seem to emerging

    it does appear that increased blockchain adoption and integrated continues to
    drive innovation and product development both in the United States and abroad
    (Lewis, McPartland and Ranjan [2017](#CR5)). An ICO, although it may sound like
    an overtly technical or abstract idea, does not differ in any substantive form,
    at a basic level, from an initial public offering. Financial services professionals
    are, almost universally, comfortable and familiar with the concept of an IPO,
    in which an organization trades ownership stakes in an organization in exchange
    for cash to fund continuing operations. An ICO operates in a similar fashion in
    terms of the implications for the organization, cash is exchanged for something
    issued by the organization, but that is where the similarities end. Instead of
    exchanging an ownership stake directly with an investor for cash, the issuing
    organization trades something a different type of asset.

    和 Ranjan [2017](#CR5)）。 尽管 ICO 听起来可能像是一个过于技术化或抽象的概念，但在基本层面上，与首次公开发行（IPO）并没有实质性的不同。
    金融服务专业人员几乎普遍熟悉并熟悉 IPO 的概念，这种概念中，一个组织以交换现金来筹集持续运营的所有权份额。 ICO 就组织的影响而言以类似方式运作，现金与组织发行的东西进行交换，但相似之处止步于此。
    发行组织与投资者直接交换所有权份额以换取现金不同，发行组织交易的是一种不同类型的资产。

    2018 is that cash raised by the organization is exchanged for a token. The technical
    details of how a token specifically works is not the purpose of this book, but
    a basic working definition of what a token represents can be as follows. A token
    is simply an option to a right, product, service, or eventually ownership is a
    firm that has raised money via an ICO at some point in the future. In other words,
    tokens can be thought of as options, which may make it easier to understand than
    simply drilling deeper into the technical weeds. A more thorough analysis is conducted

    regulatory attention and focus also continued to increase and develop. This increased
    scrutiny was also evident in the 2018 annual report of the S.E.C., where specific
    mention was made both of ICOs in general as well as the increased enforcement
    actions that the Commission was planning to bring to bear on the market in 2019
    and beyond. Such increased regulatory attention is, of course, a logical byproduct

    as a halfway point between a traditional IPO process and an initial coin offering
    that many blockchain based organizations have chosen to utilize. From a compliance
    and reporting perspective, the implementation and adoption of STOs in the cryptocurrency
    market may help resolve some of the current outstanding issues that currently
    may make the cryptocurrency space troublesome, confusing, or higher risk than
    other markets. A core difference between an ICO and an STO is that the token that
    is issued as a result of the STO process is backed by an underlying asset, share
    of an organization, or right to a share of organizational profits. Regardless
    of the label assigned to the tool, however, there are several key points that
    need to be considered when analyzing the STO space. Prior to examining some of
    these key points, however, one salient point that must be a part of every conversation
    regarding STO is the fact that these activities are approved by the S.E.C. Additionally,
    while many ICOs do not – in fact -grant investors any protections or share in
    management of the organization, the STO concept embraces both of these aspects.
    This may seem like a relatively simple delineation, but is a powerful difference

    options will have on the financial conversation.

    流程结果发行的代币由基础资产支持，组织的股份或组织利润的权利。然而，无论给该工具分配了什么标签，当分析 STO 空间时，有几个关键点需要考虑。然而，在检验其中一些关键点之前，必须谈论
    STO 的一个显著点是这些活动得到了证券交易委员会的批准。此外，虽然许多 ICO 实际上不给投资者提供任何保护或分享管理组织的机会，但 STO 的概念包含了这两个方面。这可能看起来是一个相对简单的区分，但在市场确定性和这些投资选项将对金融谈话带来的影响方面，这是一个强大的区别。

    these enforcement actions were guilty verdicts and multimillion dollar fines levied

    those organizations, indicating the seriousness with which regulators and oversight
    institutions are evaluating this emerging area. A secured token offering appears

    information is, almost by default, driven by the interpretation and analysis of
    contracts, agreements, and interpretation of standards. Whether these agreements
    and contracts are based off of agreements with suppliers, customers, and partners,
    or are driven by new FASB regulations and standards the underlying trends are
    the same. CPAs and other accounting professionals often, whether working in public
    practice or employed within private industry, spend a majority of time trying
    to understand agreements and translate those agreements into financial reports.
    Second, financial markets and financial services professionals employed in the
    full spectrum of market activities (commercial lending, investment banking, trading,
    credit trading) are increasingly driven by complicated agreements between originators,
    lenders, and third parties.

  zh: 然而，在深入分析和讨论金融服务确实与合同、协议以及对这些协议的解释如何紧密相连之前，让我们退一步。首先，会计信息几乎默认情况下是由对合同、协议和标准的解释和分析驱动的。无论这些协议和合同是基于与供应商、客户和合作伙伴的协议，还是受到新的FASB法规和标准的驱动，其潜在趋势是相同的。注册会计师和其他会计专业人士经常（无论是在公共实践中还是在私营行业内）花费大部分时间试图理解协议，并将这些协议转化为财务报告。其次，在原始人、贷款人和第三方之间的复杂协议越来越驱动着金融市场和从事全面市场活动的金融服务专业人员（商业贷款、投资银行业、交易业、信用交易业）。

    complexity of financial services is a value add or not, the fact remains that
    it continues to occur, and this complexity is potentially amplified by the intersection
    cryptocurrency with current outstanding accounting questions (Bruno and Gift [2019](#CR2)).
    Interpreting agreements, explaining agreements to third parties, and making sure
    that the financial ramifications are clear are core roles of any responsible fiduciary.
    This also connects this conversation back to the implications of smart contracts
    on the financial services environment; increased compliance and scrutiny. It is
    no secret that, across the globe, financial regulation has emerged as an increasingly
    hot button issue in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008\. There is an
    abundance of blame to go around, and has gone around, but something that is beyond
    dispute is that, in hindsight, there was a misunderstanding and misinterpretation
    of just what was contained within certain financial instruments. This connection
    between financial services, risk, and compliance form the basis for just how powerful
    the evolution of a smart contract market may very well be.

    recording of information between different organizations. For industries and situations
    that involve multiple counterparties, large amounts of paperwork, and the approval
    of multiple organizations to finalize transactions, the implementation of smart
    contracts can be a game changer. Data is what ultimately drives the decision making
    process, and the capability of different firms to process, analyze, and act on
    different pieces of data on a continuous basis may very well mean the difference

    the idea of contracts as a combination of (IF, THEN) statements, the core functionalities
    of blockchain appear to create a situation where contract applications become
    readily apparent. Blockchain technology, virtually by the very nature of how the
    technology platform functions, provides a real time platform for the communication
    and distribution of information between network members. At the current stage,
    blockchain has been developed to primarily track and monitor the flow of information
    between parties who may not necessarily trust each other. Blockchain has often
    been called the “internet of trust” or some other variation on that same theme,
    and that circles back to the consensus based model of verification at the heart
    of the platform. Contracts are, even in the friendliest of situations, between

    parties there is a lower risk of misunderstanding and potential future arguments
    than if agreements are simply oral in nature. Blockchain enable smart contracts
    can also help address this trust issue by requiring that all involved parties
    in the contract verify and approve the terms and conditions that have been uploaded
    onto the platform. In addition to this required verification, which by default
    increases the level of trust in the final document, access to different types
    of information can be restricted in a private blockchain environment. This might
    have seemed like a relatively small detail previously, but in the context of potentially
    sensitive contract information it is a huge issue. Since many contracts have clauses,
    amendments, and involve different organizations at a variety of levels, the ability
    to disclose only certain amounts of data to certain users is of paramount importance.
    Maintaining confidentiality over both proprietary processes as well as intellectual
    assets is of increasing importance with regards to not only how business is conducted,

    terms of processing routine contracts and agreements as well as dealing with litigation
    issues, are an issue that law firms and legal experts are already seeking to improve
    with various technology options. While the focus and implementation of technology
    tools have currently been focused on artificial intelligence options (more on
    that later) to date, blockchain technology is also beginning to emerge as a viable
    option. Transmission of information, both in terms of improving law firm and legal
    expert efficiency as well as improving the client experience are two distinct
    and quantitative benefits that can, and should be, realized both by individual
    lawyers and law firms. Reducing or even eliminating altogether the internal float

    gain the underlying realities remain the same. As soon as data is breached and/or
    exposed to the broader marketplace there are negative consequences for both the
    institutions that have been hacked and the individuals whose information has exposed
    to nefarious actors. As the blockchain itself, in its various iterations, has
    not been hacked to date, this extra layer of security and encryption will invariably
    add security and protection to legal transactions. It important to draw a fine

    transactions. Identifying the parties, be they individuals or institutions, involved
    in the transactions in question also allows blockchain to be in more compliance

    the payment channel is closed. Such a channel could remain open for hours, days,
    weeks, or even years; the specific time allotted is irrelevant. Only at the closing
    of this channel, whenever that may occur, would a final tallying of transactions
    be recorded onto the blockchain itself. Now, this does undermine some of the very
    security and privacy options that make using blockchain attractive and the focus

    channel is an off-chain network that runs parallel to the blockchain itself. In
    other words, these transactions and the associated information linked to these
    transactions are not directly stored on the blockchain at every single instant.
    Such an arrangement addresses some of the current shortcomings associated with
    this technology, including the lag in processing speed and the amount of time
    that is spent processing certain transactions. Using smart contracts (remember
    those are automated agreements that have been embedded into the blockchain chain),
    it allows two or more connected parties to perform transactions without having
    to broadcast every transactions to the network. Conversely, during the lifetime
    of the payment channel – which again can range from days to years – the individual
    transactions are stored off-chain. When the chain is closed, the final balance
    is mined/confirmed, and then added to the blockchain itself.

  zh: 付款渠道的核心理念与区块链技术的技术方面的名称并非毫无关联。简而言之，付款渠道是一个与区块链并行运行的离链网络。换句话说，这些交易及与这些交易相关的信息并非在每一时刻直接存储在区块链上。这样的安排解决了目前与这项技术相关的一些不足之处，包括处理速度的滞后和处理某些交易所花费的时间。通过使用智能合约（记住那些被嵌入到区块链的自动协议），它允许两个或多个相连的当事方在无需向网络广播每笔交易的情况下执行交易。相反，在付款渠道的生存期内（可以是从几天到几年），单个交易被存储在离链上。当渠道关闭时，最终余额会被挖掘/确认，然后加入到区块链中。
- en: Putting this concept into practice represents the next logical step in the payment
    channel conversation. Namely, how does a firm or individual actually go about
    putting this concept into practice? If two individuals or institutions would like
    to arrange and use a payment channel the first step in that process is to deposit
    funds into the channel. Sticking with Bitcoin, which supports the lightning network,
    the individuals or institutions would deposit BTC into the channel. Using the
    “multi-sig” address, allowing the multiple parties to send and receive BTC or
    other information between each other, and waiting until the transactions have
    concluded before broadcasting these changes to the network itself would complete
    the establishment of a channel. Potentially even more profound for the finance
    and transactions landscape is the individuals or institutions do not need to have
    direct channels between each other for the payment channel to function properly.
    As long as there is a path, using existing channels, that already exists for the
    individual or institution to transact with someone else, the payment channel protocol
    is something that can be used. The closing process itself, of any payment channel
    that has been constructed and used by multiple organizations or individuals, can
    be accomplished by any single entity that is a part of that channel. Contrasted
    with using the full blockchain to verify and post blocks of transactions, there
    are several benefits readily apparent from the utilization of a lightning based
    network.

  zh: 将这个概念付诸实践代表了支付通道对话中的下一个逻辑步骤。也就是说，一个公司或个人如何实际着手实践这个概念呢？如果两个个人或机构想要安排并使用支付通道，那么这个过程的第一步就是将资金存入通道中。以比特币为例，支持闪电网络，个人或机构将比特币存入通道。使用“多签”地址，允许多个参与方之间发送和接收比特币或其他信息，并在交易结束之前等待，然后才将这些变化广播到网络本身，以完成通道的建立。对于金融和交易行业来说，另一个可能更深远的影响是，个人或机构不需要直接之间进行通道交易才能使支付通道正常运作。只要有一条路径，利用已存在的通道，个人或机构就可以与他人进行交易，支付通道协议就可以派上用场。已被多个组织或个人构建并使用的任何支付通道的关闭过程都可以由该通道的任何单个参与方完成。与使用完整的区块链来验证和发布交易块相比，利用基于闪电的网络有几个明显的好处。

    post each block of transactions, and do not forget that each block (on the Bitcoin
    blockchain at least) can only be 1 MB in size, the members of payment channel
    only have to pay when the channel is opened or closed. For entities conducting
    hundreds and possible thousands of transactions via the payment channel, this
    can represent a significant savings opportunity.

    network, the processing speed per block of transactions can take up to 10 min
    (or longer) to verify and post to the blockchain. Via a payment channel protocol,
    however, the only limit of the speed with which transactions can be processed
    is the speed of the internet connection used by the involved entities.

    traditional blockchain, whether it is the Bitcoin blockchain or the Ethereum blockchain,
    is that neither one of these options is very scalable. The slow transaction processing
    speed, and the cost to both establish and maintain these networks means that,
    with the exception of some of the largest organizations in the market, scaling
    blockchains has not been a feasible goal. With the implementation and utilization
    of payment channels, however, such scaling is not only possible, but very practical.

    multi-sig protocol that requires all parties to sign off on a transaction before
    its validated, and hashed time lock contracts (HTLCs), to help ensure only intended
    recipients get intended coins, payment channels represent a secure option in the
    marketplace. HTLCs are time limited in nature, so the parties involved in your
    transactions have to declare receipt of nodes or other information in order for
    the transaction to actually take place and be recorded.

- en: Although the primary vehicle for introducing new cryptocurrencies or tokens
    into the marketplace has been via the Initial Coin Offering process, the increased
    regulatory scrutiny in this area has led to individuals and organizations to seek
    alternatives to this process. Specifically, the S.E.C., which is still relying
    on the Howey Test from 1946 to determine and guide the classification and transaction
    process surrounding token issuance, is seeking to temper enthusiasm surrounding
    this area. Although numerous discussions and debates have been held around the
    topic of improving and updating regulations in this space, it remains a murky
    area that is attracting the attention of numerous regulators. In addition to the
    regulatory conversations, there were numerous roundtables, debates, and hearings
    during 2018 on the status of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and the impact these
    will have on the financial services landscape at large. Now, even though airdrops
    are specifically related to the issuance of new or emerging cryptocurrencies,
    this entire process – like the cryptoasset economy at large – is dependent on
    the underlying blockchain technology.

  zh: 尽管向市场引入新加密货币或代币的主要方式是通过首次代币发行（ICO）过程，但是对这一领域的增加监管审查导致个人和组织寻求该过程的替代方案。具体而言，仍在依赖1946年的豪伊测试来确定和指导代币发行的分类和交易过程的美国证监会（S.E.C.）试图遏制该领域周围的热情。虽然围绕改进和更新该领域法规的许多讨论和辩论已经进行，但它仍然是一个模糊的领域，吸引了众多监管机构的关注。除了监管对话外，2018年还就区块链、加密货币的现状以及这些对整个金融服务领域的影响进行了许多圆桌会议、辩论和听证会。而现在，尽管空投活动特指发行新兴加密货币，但整个过程 -
    如同整个加密资产经济一样 - 都依赖于基础的区块链技术。
- en: Without diving too much into the technical underpinnings of how an airdrop intersects
    with the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, let’s walk through a relatively
    simple example of how an Airdrop may occur. It is also important to keep in mind
    that the vast majority of airdrops occur or are led by organizations that are
    seeking to launch a new coin and/or raise funding from the marketplace. For example,
    an organization seeking to launch a new cryptocurrency – let’s call it NewCoin –
    wants to gain users, increase awareness of their product, and create a market
    for future trading. They might airdrop a certain number coins (1,10, or 100 would
    all work the same way) – to the public address of bitcoin holders on the bitcoin
    blockchain. Through no action on the part of bitcoin holders, these holders now
    have access to these new coins; which all should seem like a relatively simple
    process. Now, items that might be driving questions and considerations as airdrops
    have been receiving more and more coverage in the marketplace, the following questions
    are inevitably being asked.

    interested in the intersection of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, is something
    that is of particular importance for financial services professionals. Taxes,
    although not usually something that is a fun or enjoyable conversation between
    financial professionals and clients, is a part of any accounting or advisory engagement.
    Drilling down, as airdrops become more and more commonplace in the marketplace,
    both as an alternative to ICOs and as a method for creating markets for cryptocurrencies,
    the tax regulation in this space will become an increasingly important issue.
    One of the most important questions to address is as follows is how these emerging
    topics are going to intersect and engage with the blockchain ecosystem.

  zh: 章节 4 总结
- en: Chapter [4](467992_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml) dives right into one of the most important
    topics and characteristics as it connects to blockchain and crypro to both broader
    technology trends as well as the implications these technologies have for accounting
    and other financial services. Blockchain is arguably the hottest and highest profile
    topics that has entered the finance and accounting vernacular during the last
    several years, but even with this significant amount of coverage there seems to
    remain a gap in understanding and comprehension on the side of both clients and
    practitioners. This chapter seeks to differentiate the different types of blockchain
    options available in the marketplace as well the methods by which data can be
    validated and verified by the network itself. Establishing these differences is
    important since these form the core of the platform and do make it stand out in
    an objective and quantifiable way from other databased options. Versus almost
    every other data entry or storage system in the world, which operates on a centralized
    basis, uploading and the storing of data onto a blockchain platform requires that
    at least a portion of the network members approve and verify the data as it is
    uploaded. The specifics will vary from blockchain to blockchain, but the overall
    common theme of group based data verification are consistent across blockchain
    platforms. This chapter drills into the specific types of consensus approval methodologies
    that exist in the marketplace as well as analyzing what these different methodologies
    mean for business transactions.
