    blockchain. The first step is to determine whether existing legacy solutions are
    unsatisfactory and need replacing. If so, firms need to assess whether blockchain
    is the answer. Then, they should map out the business case for developing blockchain-based
    solutions to gain support and resources (capital, personnel, time, etc.) to develop
    and test the project. This leads to designing the blockchain solution, which should
    capitalize on blockchain’s unique features and capabilities. The last step is
    preparing the organization to work with blockchain so that managers, technologists,
    and other employees unite to become successful with it.

    be little need to move to a blockchain-based solution. Before blockchains, firms
    used centralized databases to secure data and control access. The centralized
    firm controlled subordinate units and managed suppliers. A control tower or dashboard

    has served top management and key decision-makers well in the past and may be

- en: As an industry expert at Capital One commented, “keep in mind that a chain is
    only as strong as its weakest link, which is equally true of blockchains. If one
    node has performance, scale or security problems, they can impact the other nodes.
    A blockchain can be a powerful solution, but organizations should use it only
    when they have challenges that aren’t addressed well by existing technology.”[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en269)
    It is when industry structure changes so that the firm has to collaborate to satisfy
    customers—and needs accurate, timely data from independent parties—that blockchain
    becomes attractive. I have previously referred to the credit scoring industry,
    with three dominant firms in the US market, including Equifax. And as noted, centrally
    controlled deep repositories, as at Equifax, can and have been hacked, creating
    considerable collateral damage to customers. In such circumstances, blockchain-based
    decentralized creditworthiness determination, with individuals in control of their
    credit data, is the disruptive innovation with long-term potential.

    steps, including timely ordering and positioning of key spare parts at the relevant
    site. Enterprises moving to blockchain might still need to combine legacy solutions
    with blockchain, as an intermediate stage, with blockchain complementing legacy
    solutions. For example, Santander Bank was an early adopter of Ripple to lower
    cross-border remittance costs for its customers but still had to continue using
    legacy remittance transfer systems. Some customers did not or were not able to

    events, payments, and settlement of credit default swaps to the blockchain platform,
    yielding a single set of records for regulators and counterparties.[12](14085-0014.xhtml#en280)

    and can direct the future of their blockchain networks. They can shape new member
    entry, transaction fees, monetization strategies, and member rewards to suit their
    needs. They can also approve erasure of past transactions by fiat, contravening
    the immutability of a blockchain, and grant varying levels of control to different
    network nodes over issues such as changing blockchain architecture, standards
    setting, features evolution, and acceptance of future protocol changes. Other
    ecosystem members might then be less willing to join the network in a subordinate
    position. Viewing blockchains as encompassing entire ecosystems and drawing on
    ecosystem governance principles can help resolve some of the tension surrounding
    dominant member control and create greater decentralized autonomy.[23](14085-0014.xhtml#en291)

    to ascertain when the transaction would be completed or the exchange rate used
    for conversion. Blockchain applications aim to resolve these problems, with the
    goal of faster fulfillment, lower costs, and greater transparency. However, implementing
    successful cross-border remittance applications needs timely cooperation from
    multiple governments, whose jurisdictions are involved in cross-border money transfers.
    Governments have to be persuaded to collaborate with each other and accept harmonized
    cross-national regulations. And enterprises and their banks must work alongside
    central banks, regulators, and payments infrastructure operators, in a slow and

    States declined dramatically after the SEC stepped in and held that ICOs could
    be subject to, and be required to, comply with US securities law. For example,
    Telegram Group, an ICO, was forced by the SEC to return $1.2 billion to US investors

    might choose not to participate in the blockchain to avoid such governmental oversight.
    Another example of the impact of regulatory uncertainty is the debate over the
    fiduciary role and responsibility of blockchain programmers and project leaders.[27](14085-0014.xhtml#en295)
    The debate is whether or not developers of blockchain networks maintain a governance
    role that should have a fiduciary obligation toward the network’s digital asset

    premined XRP, creating one hundred billion XRP at the firm’s outset in 2012, and
    released (gifted) eighty billion XRP to the Ripple company for use in funding

    finality. It relied on blockchain’s ability to continuously update the ledger
    with transaction state and account balances to offer clients immutability and
    a timestamped audit trail. And as XRP use grows, network effects could persuade
    clients to use the Ripple network over the incumbent SWIFT solution. This would

- en: Governments are getting in on the act, with China making a national commitment
    to becoming the global leader in blockchain development and use. Not only has
    China launched a national digital currency, but it has also developed and offered
    a low-cost blockchain infrastructure,[35](14085-0014.xhtml#en303) the Blockchain-Based
    Service Network (BSN), with low-cost servers, programming tools, and standard
    templates to promote interoperability. BSN is available to both Chinese and foreign
    firms, which could host their blockchain nodes and information transmission on
    this network. The Chinese government’s control of servers in BSN is fundamentally
    different from permissionless and decentralized classic DLT as it is fully centralized,
    with the government visibility into blockchain operations taking precedence over
    privacy. An open question is the degree to which China’s oversight of BSN would
    allow it to control access and thus deny BSN use permission to individuals and
    enterprises it deemed inappropriate.

- en: Blockchain has been unleashed for some time and is taking off in different directions.
    Startups such as Audius are attempting to more amply reward musicians and other
    creators at the expense of central intermediaries. With the introduction of the
    digital Chinese yuan, stablecoins and CBDCs are even more likely to become a means
    of payment, sidelining volatile cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, although dominant
    in business blockchain applications, is losing ground because of higher processing
    costs (“gas”) and slower processing speed at higher transaction volumes, making
    room for newer protocols such as Polygon, Polkadot, Algorand, Avalanche, and others.
    *Axie Infinity*’s Ronin blockchain is one such effort, seeking to become the blockchain
    standard for other game developers, with its RON token serving as the basis for
    decentralized Ronin governance. As dissatisfaction with the internet increases,
    stemming from poor privacy controls, the spread of false information, the rise
    of dominant oligopolies, and misbehavior such as cyberbullying and hiding behind
    anonymity, blockchain shows promise as the bedrock on which Web 3.0 can be built,
    centered on secure, decentralized peer-to-peer interaction, freed from control
    by centralized entities.

  zh: 区块链已经被释放出来，并且在不同的方向上迅速发展。像Audius这样的初创公司试图通过减少中心化中介来更充分地奖励音乐家和其他创作者。随着数字人民币的引入，稳定币和CBDC甚至更有可能成为支付手段，使波动性加密货币边缘化。尽管以太坊在商业区块链应用中占据主导地位，但由于处理成本（“燃料”）更高以及在高交易量下的处理速度更慢，它正在失去优势，为像Polygon、Polkadot、Algorand、Avalanche等新兴协议让路。*Axie
    Infinity*的Ronin区块链就是这样的努力，试图成为其他游戏开发者的区块链标准，其RON代币作为去中心化Ronin治理的基础。随着对互联网的不满日益增加，这源于拙劣的隐私控制、虚假信息的传播、主导寡头的崛起以及网络欺凌和匿名等不当行为，区块链显示出作为构建以安全、去中心化的点对点互动为中心的Web
    3.0的基石的潜力，摆脱中心化实体的控制。

    report, “when done right, blockchain is all about rethinking business models,
    rethinking relationships between companies and between companies and customers,
    and is, at its heart, a strategic change effort.”[36](14085-0014.xhtml#en304)
    Experimentation allows enterprises to assess different alternative configurations
    for their proposed solution, such as choosing between open-source and customized
    blockchain protocols. They can resort to sandboxes, with a limited number of participants,
    separated from mainstream legacy operations, to control risk. They can try out
    different governance arrangements to pinpoint accountability and maintain quality
    and equity. They can also explore the implications of instant settlement with
    different payment rails, ranging from accepting cryptocurrency payments to private
    stablecoins such as USDC or DAI as well as CBDCs, as they become available.

    实验允许企业评估他们提出的解决方案的不同替代配置，例如在开源和定制区块链协议之间进行选择。他们可以求助于沙箱，参与人数有限，与主流传统运营分离，以控制风险。他们可以尝试不同的治理安排，以确定责任并保持质量和公平。他们还可以探索即时结算的不同支付轨道的影响，从接受加密货币支付到私人稳定币如USDC或DAI，以及随着CBDC的推出而出现的其他选项。
- en: Experimentation also allows enterprises to give attention to regulatory acceptance
    and compliance, for example, blockchain compatibility with privacy regulations,
    such as the EU’s GDPR and the “right to be forgotten,” which would seem to be
    at odds with blockchain’s tamperproof and immutable nature. Balance-based blockchains
    that validate the updated account balances, such as Algorand, provide one approach
    to complying with right-to-be-forgotten privacy demands.[37](14085-0014.xhtml#en305)
    Such experimentation, with evaluating different protocols and with issues such
    as instant settlement, is essential, and urgent, if enterprises are to learn about
    the nuances of blockchain development and implementation and to keep abreast of
    a rapidly evolving technology, one in which both start-up challengers and their
