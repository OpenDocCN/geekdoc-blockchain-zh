    quick to forget all that happened over the previous ten years, which leads them
    to underestimate the potential change that will come in the next decade thanks
    to new technology. In previous chapters, we’ve looked at the remarkable changes
    that blockchain technology has made possible. In the years to come, I believe
    a whole new financial ecosystem built and centered around blockchain and cryptocurrency
    will become the norm. This brand-new system will exist detached from the dominant
    fiat money systems that will still be in place but will have regulation under
    the government closer to that of fiat money. It will pose a challenge to the regulators
    as governments are forced to make adjustments to adapt to this new, other financial
    ecosystem. The crypto economy currently stands at around $300 billion. Though
    it still can’t compare to the fiat money-based economies of the world, it’s still
    enormous and undeniable. In this last chapter, I’m going to let my imagination
    run wild a little bit and explore the potential innovations that I think could
    make crypto and blockchain explode even more dramatically in the years to come.

  zh: 我喜欢这个原因，因为它说明了人性的一些特点。人们很快就会忘记过去十年发生的一切，这导致他们低估了新技术带来的潜在变革。在之前的章节中，我们探讨了区块链技术所可能带来的惊人变化。在未来几年，我相信一个以区块链和加密货币为中心全新的金融生态系统将成为常态。这个全新的系统将与仍然存在的主权货币系统分离，但受政府的监管，类似于主权货币。它将对监管机构构成挑战，因为政府不得不做出调整以适应这个新的、其他的金融生态系统。目前，加密货币经济总量约为3000亿美元。虽然它仍然不能与世界上基于主权货币的经济相提并论，但这个数字仍然巨大且不可忽视。在最后一章，我将让我的想象力稍微放纵一点，探索我认为可能在未来的几年里使加密货币和区块链更加戏剧性地爆发的创新潜力。

- en: Crime has been associated with Bitcoin since the day it was born. Due to the
    convenience and anonymity it adds to transactions, Bitcoin has been one of the
    easiest way for criminals to undertake illegal financial activities. Illegal transactions
    and trading have generated considerable amount of wealth for certain individuals.
    One well-known example is the Silk Road that was a Dark Web website that sold
    everything from drugs to stolen goods to Mafia “hits.” It was designed to allow
    users to browse anonymously and securely with no potential for monitoring. Bitcoin
    was the chief currency used on the Silk Road. The FBI initially seized 26,000
    Bitcoins from accounts associated with the Silk Road, worth approximately $3.6
    million at the time. The site was ultimately shut down, and the mastermind behind
    it was sentenced to life in prison.

  zh: 自从比特币诞生之日起，犯罪就与比特币联系在一起。由于它为交易带来了便利和匿名性，比特币一直是犯罪分子进行非法金融活动最容易的方式之一。非法交易和贸易为某些人创造了相当的财富。一个著名的例子就是丝绸之路，它是一个暗网网站，出售从毒品到被盗商品再到黑手党“暗杀”服务的各种物品。该网站旨在使用户能够匿名且安全地浏览，没有任何被监控的可能性。比特币是丝绸之路的主要货币。联邦调查局（FBI）最初从与丝绸之路关联的账户中没收了26,000个比特币，当时价值约为360万美元。该网站最终被关闭，其背后的主谋被判处终身监禁。
- en: Though the Silk Road fiasco happened in the early days of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency
    is still associated in the public’s mind with money laundering and other illegal
    activities. As I’ve noted, different countries have different attitudes toward
    cryptocurrency and related financial tools. China and South Korea have banned
    ICOs, yet in some Mediterranean counties like Malta, cryptocurrency receives a
    warm welcome. The USA is still on the fence. The CFTC and the SEC—as well as individual
    states—have imposed some regulations on cryptocurrency and shut down some bad
    actors. For technology enthusiasts, the concern is that governments will shut
    down crypto everywhere if it is being used for illegal activity anywhere. For
    now, as the rapid growth of cryptocurrency continues, the shutting down of crypto
    entirely remains a very remote possibility.

  zh: 尽管丝绸之路的丑闻发生在比特币的早期阶段，但在公众的脑海中，加密货币仍然与洗钱和其他非法活动联系在一起。正如我提到的，不同国家对加密货币及其相关金融工具有不同的态度。中国和韩国已经禁止了ICO，但在一些地中海国家，如马耳他，加密货币受到了热烈的欢迎。美国仍然在观望。商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）和证券交易委员会（SEC）以及个别州已经对加密货币实施了一些监管措施，并关闭了一些不良分子。对于技术爱好者来说，担忧的是，如果加密货币在任何地方被用于非法活动，政府将会在世界各地关闭加密货币。目前，随着加密货币的快速增长，彻底关闭加密货币的可能性仍然非常遥远。
- en: Bitcoin and Ether have been acknowledged as commodities by CFTC, and Bitcoin
    futures have been accepted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago
    Board of Exchange (CBOE). As to the true “value” of Bitcoin, we can reasonably
    compare it to gold. (To be clear, I’m not encouraging you to invest in Bitcoins
    here.) But two of the early investors in Bitcoin, who went on to become billionaires,
    the Winklevosses, have said they consider Bitcoin like a kind of “Gold 2.0.” A
    place to store value. Personally, I think Bitcoin has the potential to hold stronger
    value than gold. The value of gold comes from its scarcity and durability. But
    Bitcoin equals or surpasses gold when it comes to scarcity, portability, visibility,
    and fungibility. Bitcoin’s portability is an additional benefit over gold. So
    far, Bitcoin has about a $300 billion market cap, while gold is at $6 trillion.
    The Winklevosses believe that Bitcoin could very well increase in value another
    twenty times over what it’s worth today. In an interview with me, Tyler Winklevoss
    said he believes that one day the market cap of Bitcoin will equal or surpass
    that of gold. Still, there are uncertainties concerning Bitcoin as a store of
    value. The biggest among these may simply be the fact that there are still issues
    surrounding all cryptocurrencies. But the future will reveal itself as time goes
    by. We will have to be patient.
