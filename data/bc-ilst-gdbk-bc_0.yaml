- en: The tech world of today changes so quickly, oftentimes at breakneck speed. Internet
    finance had its run for several years, and then Financial Technology (FinTech)
    took its place. After the rise of FinTech plateaued, Bitcoin emerged. Then when
    Bitcoin miners and speculators came together, Blockchain technology thrived, and
    so began a new community. Waves of new concepts—ones that had been previously
    unheard of—captivated us. And with this soaring innovation and progressive technology,
    a surge of unfound anticipation of what the future may hold consumed us—even if
    we didn’t fully understand the technology.

  zh: 今天的科技界变化如此之快，很多时候都是迅雷不及掩耳之势。互联网金融风靡了几年，然后金融科技（FinTech）取而代之。在FinTech崛起之后，比特币问世。随后，当比特币矿工和投机者聚集在一起时，区块链技术蓬勃发展，一个新的社区就此诞生。一波接一波的新概念——之前闻所未闻的概念——让我们着迷。正是这种激增的创新和进步的科技，让我们对未来可能发生的事情充满了前所未有的期待——即使我们并不完全理解这项技术。
- en: 'As this community grew, tech geeks created esoteric terms and lingo to build
    industry barriers against outsiders. Yet, in doing so, these terms—filled with
    technical jargon and gobbledygook—only added to the confusion of those on the
    outside, further isolating them from the world. Over time, an unintended consequence
    occurred: they lost the ability to communicate with the layman. Still, the general
    public is eager to learn more about this growing community and technology, as
    they don’t want to fall too far behind in what they likely see as the inevitable
    future of tech and finance.'

  zh: 随着这个社区的成长，科技极客创造了深奥的术语和行话，以建立行业壁垒，防止外人进入。然而，这样做反而使得这些术语——充满了技术术语和胡言乱语——让外行人更加困惑，进一步将他们与这个世界隔离。随着时间的推移，一个意想不到的后果发生了：他们失去了与普通人的沟通能力。尽管如此，大众仍然渴望了解更多关于这个不断成长的社区和技术，因为他们不想在科技和金融这个看似不可避免的未来中落后太远。
- en: With this kind of growing excitement and curiosity, I paid close attention to
    Bitcoin mining, the algorithmic logic of tech geeks and Blockchain prophets. In
    the face of all the changes in finance, art, science, technology, and society,
    we will closely follow these innovations. And even though this may ultimately
    lead to nowhere, the journey itself—one filled with great unknowns—is worth it
    alone. This is Blockchain.

  zh: 面对这样的增长热情和好奇心，我密切关注着比特币挖矿，这是科技极客和区块链先知的算法逻辑。面对金融、艺术、科学、技术和社会的所有变化，我们将紧跟这些创新。即使这最终可能带我们走向
    nowhere，这段旅程本身——充满了巨大的未知——也是值得的。这就是区块链。
- en: 'In the summer of 2016, I took part in a three-day conference of Blockchain
    held on Necker Island in the Caribbean. Richard Branson, the famous hippie and
    entrepreneur, invited a dozen figures in various fields from different countries
    to discuss the application of Blockchain in the arms of waves and sunny beaches.
    Yes, it was indeed time travel. More than thirty people who had never met one
    another, with the background of governments, courts, intelligent systems, art,
    aerospace, and environmental agencies, came together. We held dozens of discussions
    on various subjects, including the capture of fugitives, prevention of money laundering,
    protection of artistic property rights, validation of transaction authenticity,
    corruption prevention, social elections, earthquake relief, and endangered species
    protection. While vividly feeling the concrete achievements in these fields, we
    were also experiencing a commonly applied logic: all discussions were results
    of spontaneous organization and cross cooperation based on big data analysis,
    without any authoritative organization or enterprise organizing the system and
    process. According to the words of a young man on the site, we were creating a
    brand new trust agreement, with all the participants writing programs restricting
    our own behaviors. There was no condescending god, king, government, or big company
    making central control, the world was still running, and more important, the revolution
    was happening. This young man was Alex Tapscott. He and his father, Don Tapscott,
    the writer of many bet sellers such as Wikinomics, had just published their new
    book Blockchain Revolution, now popular in China. In January of 2017, when Don
    Tapscott and I were guests together at an activity, I invited him to give a speech
    at the Chinese Museum of Finance this summer.'

  zh: 在2016年的夏天，我参加了一个在加勒比海尼克尔岛举行的三天区块链会议。著名的嬉皮士和企业家理查德·布兰森邀请了几位来自不同国家的各领域的知名人士，讨论区块链在波浪和阳光沙滩中的应用。是的，这确实是时空旅行。三十多人从未相互见面，他们有着政府、法院、智能系统、艺术、航天和环保机构的背景，聚集在一起。我们在包括追捕逃犯、预防洗钱、保护艺术产权、验证交易真实性、预防腐败、社会选举、地震救援和保护濒危物种等各个主题上进行了数十次讨论。在感受到这些领域具体的成就的同时，我们也体验到了一种普遍适用的逻辑：所有讨论都是基于大数据分析的自发组织和跨合作的结果，没有权威组织或企业组织系统和流程。根据现场一位年轻人的说法，我们正在创造一个全新的信任协议，所有参与者都在编写程序限制我们自己的行为。没有傲慢的上帝、国王、政府或大公司进行中央控制，世界仍在运转，更重要的是，革命正在发生。这位年轻人是亚历克斯·塔普斯科特。他和他的父亲，唐·塔普斯科特，撰写了许多畅销书，如《维基经济学》的作者，刚刚出版了他们的新书《区块链革命》，在中国很受欢迎。2017年1月，当唐·塔普斯科特和我一起参加一个活动时，我邀请他在今年夏天给中国金融博物馆做一个演讲。
- en: 'Almost none of those who attended the conference on Necker Island were technical
    experts or Bitcoin miners, and they knew nothing about hash algorithm and the
    issue of double spending. But we all discussed Blockchain confidently. The reason
    is simple: TV program producers do not need to know how TV signals are launched
    and displayed, and it is not necessary for mobile phone designers to understand
    technical principles of 4G (the 4-generation mobile communication technology)
    and functions of each component. Also, for consumers to make phone calls or watch
    TV, in-depth technical knowledge reserve is not essential. During the evening
    party on the last night of the conference, the host proposed an interesting game
    in which everyone gave a unique definition of Blockchain. Some friends from Africa
    and Germany even rapped to express their ideas. Several keywords used were “trust,”
    “certificate,” and “transfer of value.” The Blockchain can realize the transfer
    of value and is the second-generation Internet beyond information transfer. Certainly,
    those were the perceptions at that time. Today, we have significantly enriched
    our understanding of Blockchain. Everyone has the right to comprehend Blockchain.
    Specific standard definitions are not required.'

  zh: 在尼克尔岛会议上参加的大部分人并非技术专家或比特币矿工，他们对散列算法和双重支付问题一无所知。但我们所有人都充满信心地讨论区块链。原因很简单：电视节目制作人不需要知道电视信号是如何发射和显示的，手机设计师也不需要理解4G（第四代移动通信技术）的技术原理和各个组件的功能。同样，消费者要打电话或看电视，深入的技术知识储备并非必需。在会议的最后一天晚上晚会上，主持人提出一个有趣的游戏，让每个人都给出区块链的独特定义。一些来自非洲和德国的朋友甚至用说唱来表达他们的观点。所用到的关键词有“信任”，“证书”和“价值转移”。区块链可以实现价值的转移，是超越信息传递的第二代互联网。当然，那是我们当时的认识。今天，我们对区块链的理解已经大大丰富。每个人都有权理解区块链。不需要具体的标准定义。
- en: By March 2017, more than forty Chinese books on Blockchain could be found online.
    It is estimated that another hundred will be published by the end of 2017\. Similar
    to the period when the Internet just entered China, the overflow of books on Blockchain
    is a significant initial signal of this tide. Various translation versions of
    “Internet” appeared at that time, such as ![images](../Images/inl1.jpg) or ![images](../Images/inl2.jpg)
    but they were finally replaced by ![images](../Images/inl3.jpg) Geeks have widely
    used the translation of Blockchain as ![images](../Images/inl4.jpg) but someday
    this translation might also be replaced by a better one. The Museum of Fintech
    initiated two rounds of discussions on its translation in 2016\. Some counterparts
    and I preferred the version of ![images](../Images/inl5.jpg) But I also agree
    with many friends engaging in financial supervision, who think under China’s current
    situation, ![images](../Images/inl6.jpg) or “credibility” in English, may be misused
    by illegal fund-raisers, so it will be better to let regulatory agencies evaluate
    the credibility.

  zh: 到2017年3月，网络上可以找到超过四十本关于区块链的中国书籍。预计到2017年底还将有上百本新书出版。正如互联网刚进入中国时期一样，区块链书籍的大量出现是这一潮流的显著初始信号。当时出现了各种“互联网”的翻译版本，比如![images](../Images/inl1.jpg)或![images](../Images/inl2.jpg)，但最终都被![images](../Images/inl3.jpg)所取代。极客们广泛使用将区块链翻译为![images](../Images/inl4.jpg)，但有一天这个翻译也许也会被更好的翻译所取代。金融科技博物馆在2016年启动了两轮关于其翻译的讨论。一些同行业人士和我倾向于![images](../Images/inl5.jpg)的版本。但我还同意许多从事金融监管的朋友的观点，他们认为在中国当前的情况下，![images](../Images/inl6.jpg)或者“credibility”在英文中，可能会被非法集资者滥用，所以最好由监管机构来评估信用。
- en: Blockchain originated from Bitcoin and was explored and generalized as its underlying
    technology. Bitcoin caused widespread concerns in society, particularly under
    China’s utilitarian atmosphere, which sticks to making profits. It became widely
    used in finance and investment sectors and was also immediately under close supervision.
    Meanwhile, Blockchain technology emerged and formed a more extensive application
    space independently. Like Internet’s TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or IP
    (Internet Protocol), if you are not obsessed with decoding and coding, you will
    be aware that applying Blockchain technology enjoys broader and deeper applications
    than browsing the Internet or conducting e-commerce transactions. Many people
    consider Blockchain to be an enormous distributed ledger system. Everyone gets
    involved in keeping and checking accounts, and no one can tamper with the data.
    It makes sense, but the function of Blockchain is far more than certificate function
    for keeping accounts.

  zh: 区块链起源于比特币，并作为其底层技术被探索和推广。比特币在社会中引起了广泛关注，尤其是在中国功利主义的氛围下，追求利润。它在金融和投资领域被广泛使用，也立即受到严格监管。与此同时，区块链技术独立地形成了更广泛的应用空间。就像互联网的TCP（传输控制协议）或IP（互联网协议）一样，如果你不沉迷于解码和编码，你就会意识到应用区块链技术比浏览互联网或进行电子商务交易有更广泛和更深入的应用。许多人认为区块链是一个巨大的分布式账本系统。每个人都参与记账和查账，没有人能篡改数据。这是有道理的，但区块链的功能远不止于记账的证书功能。
- en: Blockchain is actually a kind of concept that replaces authority control and
    affect-based trust with technical design to establish a network structure in which
    all participants can become nodes and be involved in authentication, right confirmation,
    transaction, review, and adjustment. Features like transparency, low cost, fast
    speed, and broad distribution make it impossible for authorities to modify, forge,
    and ban records. We can imagine that in today’s fields of business, art, law,
    technology, politics, and even society, such a network infrastructure of civilized
    society building on computing ability and technical structure is very different
    from its counterparts. Operating without human feelings, it gets rid of crazy
    dreams, bossy authorities, distorted monopolistic consortia, and blind conspiracies
    concerning populism. Therefore, commercial fraud and emotional deception will
    not apply.

  zh: 区块链实际上是一种用技术设计取代权威控制和情感信任的概念，以建立一个所有参与者都能成为节点并参与认证、权利确认、交易、审查和调整的网络结构。透明性、低成本、高速度和广泛分布等特点使得当局无法修改、伪造和禁止记录。我们可以想象，在今天商业、艺术、法律、科技、政治甚至社会等领域，这样的基于计算能力和技术结构的文明社会网络基础设施与其它社会结构大相径庭。没有人类情感的运作，摆脱了疯狂的梦想、专制的当局、扭曲的垄断集团和民粹主义的盲目阴谋。因此，商业欺诈和情感欺骗将不适用。
- en: Whether we like it or not, a new society driven by Blockchain is forming, which
    not only happens in such fields as Bitcoin and financial technology. This embodies
    the vast change in society and the revolutionary influence referred to by many.
    Although the anonymous person known as Satoshi Nakamoto is the cornerstone of
    this era, the accumulation of social big data, unprecedented breakthroughs in
    computing, a pluralist and complex social network, and especially the life attitude
    and spirit of free choice possessed by people born after the 1980s all contribute
    to the core foundation of the Blockchain society. It might be difficult for us
    to foresee the future pivot of the Blockchain society, but it does disrupt our
    existing lifestyle. Nowadays, the most important thing is not how we define Blockchain,
    but how to understand and enter the Blockchain society.

  zh: 不管我们喜欢与否，一个由区块链驱动的新社会正在形成，这不仅发生在比特币和金融科技等领域。这体现了社会的大变革和许多人所提到的革命性影响。尽管那个匿名人士中本聪是这个时代的基石，但是社会大数据的积累、计算前所未有的突破、多元复杂的社交网络，尤其是1980后所拥有的自由选择的生活态度和精神，都为区块链社会的核心基础做出了贡献。我们可能难以预见区块链社会的未来转折点，但它确实颠覆了我们现有的生活方式。如今，最重要的是不是我们如何定义区块链，而是如何理解和融入区块链社会。

- en: On January 17, 2017, the world’s first Global Blockchain Business Council, which
    involved both governments and commercial organizations, was formally established
    by 25 countries. Jamie Elizabeth Smith, the former spokesperson and special assistant
    of U.S. President Obama, issued the Davos Declaration. The first national team
    members include many influential figures, such as Senior Executive of the World
    Bank Mariana Dahan, former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, former Prime
    Minister of Haiti Laurent Lamont, and former Economy Minister of Ukraine Aivaras
    Abromavičius. As one of the founding members of GBBC, the China Blockchain Representative
    Team serves as the leader of the Training and Accreditation Committee of Blockchain,
    which is a critical chance for China to be involved in setting standards in this
    emerging field. According to the agreement, GBBC is going to compile textbooks
    concerning Blockchain in 2017 and open free training courses to popularize Blockchain
    applications, which are supported by all walks of life. After this news released
    on the WeChat, 170 people across the country signed up for this course in just
    three days. Lecturers included the former Deputy Chairman of the China Insurance
    Regulatory Commission Wei Yingning, the first President of the China Blockchain
    Applied Research Center Xu Mingxing, and the newly appointed President Deng Di.
    The first trainees will be certified with GBBC and the Museum of Internet Finance.
    At present, Shanghai, Zhuhai, and other areas have started the new training program.
    The popularization of the Blockchain concept and successful application of Blockchain
    require the active engagement of the new generation of entrepreneurs and the tolerance
    and care of supervisors. Invited by the compilers of this book to write this preface,
    I’d like to finish by noting that I cherish the valuable opportunity to impart
    cutting-edge technology to trainees. I hope we can work together to lay a solid
    foundation for the Blockchain society.
