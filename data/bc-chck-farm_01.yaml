    ninety-year-old great-uncle understands famine’s words well. When I visit him
    one winter, he takes me on an indulgent trip to the food court near his house,
    at Tianjin’s Kerry Center. He has a small, tidy pension that he spends sparingly;
    he never goes out to eat. Yet he says my visit is special, so I know his affection

    you are stewarding for the government. If you do decide to migrate to the city,
    your children’s access to Beijing’s wonderful schools is limited. The amount you
    get reimbursed for a hospital visit in Beijing is next to nothing, and if you

    It was these enterprises that marked the “rural roots of Chinese capitalism,”
    writes Huang.^([2](notes-ch1.xhtml#notes-ch1-2)) According to Huang, rural residents
    from some of the poorest provinces were undertaking bold entrepreneurship that
    was impossible in cities. These entrepreneurial models, TVEs, were radically different
    from the government-controlled State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Instead, TVEs were
    a decisively indigenous innovation, centered around local, village-level decision-making—an
    *agile* environment of sorts. By 1995, “TVEs accounted for approximately a quarter
    of China’s GDP, two-thirds of the total rural output … and more than one-third
    of China’s export earnings.”^([3](notes-ch1.xhtml#notes-ch1-3)) And with this
    economic boom, free market socialism allowed for another kind of national consciousness
    to emerge. Rather than being at the whim of other countries’ political events,
    global stirrings, and European treaties, perhaps China might gain the freedom
    to define a future on its own terms—the kind of power that had long been afforded

    like the Made in China 2025 strategic plan to cultivate China’s knowledge industries,
    alongside a firm focus on the countryside as a place of technological growth.
    While the countryside and agriculture may seem antithetical to the project of
    industrialization and high-tech work, the balancing act that China is currently
    undertaking emphasizes how intertwined the rural and urban are, with technological
    change threaded throughout. What China faces now is a potential “agrarian transition,”
    a term used by economists and agricultural policy makers. Agrarian transition
    is the process in which farmers are pushed out of the countryside and small-scale
    farming is replaced by industrialized agriculture, which requires less manual
    labor. As a result, there is a surplus of labor as farmers attempt to re-skill
    or find new jobs.

  zh: 同样的脆弱性培育了技术自力更生的民族主义战略，就像“中国制造2025”战略计划一样，该计划旨在培育中国的知识产业，重点放在农村作为技术增长的地方。虽然农村和农业看起来与工业化和高科技工作项目相矛盾，但中国当前正在进行的平衡表明农村与城市的紧密联系，技术变革贯穿其中。中国现在面临的是一个潜在的“农业转型”，这是经济学家和农业政策制定者使用的术语。农业转型是指农民被逼迫离开农村，小规模农业被工业化农业取代，这种农业需要较少的体力劳动。因此，随着农民尝试重新获得技能或找到新工作，劳动力出现了过剩。
- en: The same thing occurred during the Industrial Revolution in the West. As the
    agronomist Eric Holt-Giménez describes, technologies such as the steam engine,
    mills, and the telegraph were only partially responsible for industrialization
    and capitalism. Labor, especially factory labor, played an equally important role,
    and the Industrial Revolution “could have never happened without the agrarian
    transition. The Industrial Revolution displaced people from the countryside and
    created a large reserve army of labor.”^([4](notes-ch1.xhtml#notes-ch1-4)) While
    the transition might sound easy or logical, the social, environmental, and political
    ramifications of an agrarian transition are enormous. And after such transitions,
    when development in urban areas reaches new kinds of peaks, labor finds ways to
    expand and transform under a free market.

    I couldn’t help but compare them to American rural policies. Back home, driving
    down the California I-5, which cuts through the agricultural Central Valley, always
    reveals San Francisco as being a kind of urban delusion. Along the I-5 is a procession
    of Amazon fulfillment warehouses, resource extraction sites, industrial agriculture,
    communities ravaged by the Farm Crisis of the 1980s, and prisons—one of the biggest
    industries in the rural United States, and growing ever larger. A 2001 article
    from *The New York Times* about economic revitalization in rural America said
    that building prisons was more effective than building Walmarts or meatpacking
    plants in stimulating economic growth. As the abolitionist and scholar Ruth Wilson
    Gilmore writes in her book *Golden Gulag: Prisons,* *Surplus, Crisis, and Opposition
    in Globalizing California*, prisons were purposefully constructed in rural California
    throughout the 1990s with an economic agenda. The rural prison industry was fueled
    by policy makers trying to alleviate the economic crisis, because even as crime
    rates declined across America, prison populations grew. Building rural prisons
    would capitalize on the surplus foreclosed land that came from the Farm Crisis,
    and transfer vulnerable urban communities of color into rural prisons just as
    the social services of education, health care, and public assistance were being
    eroded. A 2017 study by the Vera Institute of Justice highlighted how the rural
    incarceration trend continues to grow. According to the study, financial incentives
    encourage the building of more rural prisons, and thousands of rural prisons are
    expanding their capacity—despite drastically declining crime rates and growing
    evidence that rural prison industries fuel national sociopolitical upheaval.'

    沿着I-5是一系列亚马逊仓储中心，资源开采地点，工业农业，80年代农业危机肆虐的社区以及监狱——这是美国农村最大的产业之一，而且还在不断增长。 《纽约时报》2001年的一篇文章关于美国农村经济复苏称，建造监狱比建造沃尔玛或肉类加工厂更有效刺激经济增长。
    正如废奴主义者和学者鲁思·威尔逊·吉尔莫尔在她的著作《金色地狱：监狱，剩余，全球化加利福尼亚的危机和反抗》中写道，20世纪90年代，监狱是有经济目的地在加利福尼亚农村建造的。
    农村监狱产业得到政策制定者的推动，试图缓解经济危机，因为尽管整个美国的犯罪率下降，但监狱人口却在增长。 建造农村监狱会充分利用来自农业危机的被没收土地的剩余，并把城市的有色社区转移到农村监狱，就在教育、卫生保健和公共援助等社会服务正逐渐减少。
    Vera司法研究所2017年的一项研究强调了农村监禁趋势的持续增长。根据该研究，财政激励推动着建造更多农村监狱，并且成千上万农村监狱正在扩大其容量——尽管犯罪率大幅下降，而且越来越多的证据表明农村监狱产业正在助长全国的社会政治动荡。

    to maintain that harmony. This was a sentiment I heard often from farmers as I
    traveled throughout the countryside. One farmer told me that the future is a created

    which controls other organs, the processes that regulate our body, consciousness,
    and emotion. In Chinese medicine, there are eleven vital organs that work holistically
    to sustain life, and this list does not include the brain. Brain functions are
    scattered throughout the body.

  zh: 在2022年冬季，当风险投资资金和公众对AI的热情消失时，一群中国科学家和阿里巴巴AI实验室的研究人员开始了泛化AI模型的任务。他们并没有从西方的心灵哲学出发，而是从中国的身体理论、中医和佛教思想开始。在西方医学中，人体模型以控制其他器官、调节我们身体、意识和情绪的过程的大脑为中心。在中医中，有十一个重要的器官共同维持生命，而这个列表不包括大脑。大脑功能分散在全身。

    and outputs from a combination of artificial and human organs. This hybrid machine
    was able to perform broader tasks without further training data; however, it was
    still not fully sentient. Scientists believe further development is needed to
    better understand what other parts of the body creative and language functions
    reside in. Yet the ability of the machine to extend its thinking was the first
    breakthrough in a long, icy AI winter.

  zh: 研究人员成功地创造了一个带有来自人工和人体器官的电输入输出的预训练神经网络。这种混合机器能够执行更广泛的任务而无需进一步的训练数据；然而，它仍然不是完全有思维的。科学家相信需要进一步发展来更好地理解身体的其他部位在哪里才能创造和语言功能。然而，这台机器扩展思维的能力是长期冰冷的AI冬天的第一个突破。

    in Chinese medicine), such as hair, skin, or muscle, to send to the machine-meat
    hybrid. In order to nourish this system of organs and neural networks, it had
    to be constantly fed tonifying food: foods to nourish the vital organs in the
    system.'

  zh: 系统无法像传统的气（中医定义的力量）传递给机器-肉类混合体的Typical Conduits，比如头发、皮肤或肌肉。为了滋养这套器官和神经网络系统，它必须不断地被喂养提神食物：滋养系统中的重要器官的食物。
- en: This porridge was developed by researchers to nourish and tonify the system.
    It’s quick and easy to make. You can use a pressure cooker, an Instant Pot, or
    a rice cooker with a porridge setting. Make sure the rice-to-soy-milk ratio is
    1:10\. After that, put in the other ingredients (dong quai, goji berries, ginger,
    red dates, dried apricots). Bring the mixture to a boil and then simmer for 1
    hour, or run the porridge setting on your Instant Pot.

  zh: 这种粥是研究人员开发出来滋养身体系统的。它快速又容易制作。你可以使用压力锅、即时锅或带有粥模式的电饭锅。确保米饭和豆浆的比例是1:10。然后，添加其他配料（当归、枸杞、姜、红枣、干杏）。将混合物煮沸然后煮沸1小时，或者在即时锅上运行粥模式。
