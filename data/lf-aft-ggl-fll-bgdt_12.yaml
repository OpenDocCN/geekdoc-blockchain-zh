- en: Wandering the streets of Cypherville, standing on the corner of Bitcoin and
    Gold, peering in all directions, I hankered for a hero for my still hollow tale.
    Forlornly noting no heroines in view on this virtually all-male frontier, I circled
    the cenotaph of what they call the “bitcoin space.” I contemplated the tattoos
    and ponytails, the suits and ties, the electronic cigs and medicinal smokes, the
    credentials and the Cringelys of the worldwide “blockchain community.” They were
    mostly a peer-to-peer display. Marc Andreessen or Gavin Andresen, Naval Ravikant
    or Chamath Palihapitiya, Jed McCaleb or Nick Szabo could move a scene or animate
    a meeting or keynote a CoinSummit. But from venture capitalists to complementary
    coders to bit players or even legendary titans, none seemed to have the proof-of-work
    to hash into the Genesis Block of a heroic bitcoin chain.

  zh: 在赛弗维尔的街道上徘徊，站在比特币和黄金的街角，四处张望，我渴望为我依然空洞的故事找到一个英雄。在这个几乎全是男性的前沿，我失望地注意到没有女英雄在视野中。我绕着所谓的“比特币空间”的纪念碑转了一圈。我思考着这个全球“区块链社区”的纹身和马尾辫、西装和领带、电子香烟和医疗烟草、证件和克林吉利（Cringely）们。他们大多是点对点的展示。从风险投资家到补充编码者再到配角，甚至是传奇巨人，马克·安德森或加文·安德森，纳瓦尔·拉维坎特或查马斯·帕利哈皮蒂亚，杰德·麦卡勒布或尼克·萨波，都似乎没有证据能够在英雄般的比特币链的创世区块中融入工作证明。
- en: Finally I gave up on this accessible circle and resolved to find and interview
    the Genesis man himself. Why not? Satoshi Nakamoto was the architect of bitcoin,
    inventor of the blockchain, and the prime mover of the plot. True, he did not
    mention the blockchain in his paper, though he specified it, and true, no one
    seemed to know who he was or where he had gone. No one could depict his fleshly
    contours or countenance. He was the John Galt of this saga, the source and symbol
    of the new Galt’s Gulch of bitcoin. I decided to mount my steed and ride up the
    arroyo to the ultimate crypts and redoubts, mines and mints of the bitcoin and
    blockchain ideas and their derivatives.

- en: 'Satoshi explained: “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally
    controlled networks like Napster, but pure peer-to-peer networks like Gnutella
    [music] and Tor [The Onion Router for encrypted email and video] seem to be holding
    their own.” Indeed, earlier in the century, the Tor system, originated in the
    NSA and developed by the entrepreneur Bram Cohen, comprised close to half of all
    Internet bits. Tor takes a video file, for example, and splits it up, peer to
    peer, across as many as seven thousand computers on the Net. Encrypting all the
    addresses and decrypting them one at a time as the file is relayed across the
    network, Tor ensures that no one knows the source or path of the file. Each file’s
    set of addresses is an onion that sheds its layers only as needed in passing to
    its destination. Satoshi’s bitcoin system could be said to reverse Cohen’s approach.
    Rather than concealing the information in transactions, bitcoin compiles it in
    blocks, timestamps it, and publishes it across all the nodes of the entire network.
    It is security not by concealment but by publicity. Both bitcoin and Tor are global
    data structures collectively maintained by untrusting participants. Without a
    central point of failure, Tor has been remarkably robust and successful.'

  zh: Satoshi解释道：“政府擅长切断像Napster这样的中心控制网络的头部，但纯粹的点对点网络，如Gnutella[音乐]和Tor[用于加密电子邮件和视频的洋葱路由器]似乎能够自主运行。”事实上，在本世纪早期，Tor系统起源于NSA，由企业家布拉姆·科恩开发，占据了几乎一半的互联网比特。Tor将一个视频文件分割成数千个计算机之间的点对点传输，通过网络。将所有地址加密并逐一解密，以文件在网络上传递时，Tor确保没有人知道文件的来源或路径。每个文件的地址集合就像一个洋葱，在传递到目的地时只会逐步剥开其层。可以说，Satoshi的比特币系统颠覆了Cohen的方法。比特币不是通过隐藏交易信息，而是将其编译成块，加上时间戳，并将其发布到整个网络的所有节点上。这不是通过隐藏而是通过公开来实现安全。比特币和Tor都是由不信任参与者共同维护的全球数据结构。Tor没有中心故障点，因此表现出色并取得了成功。
- en: Bitcoin can be, too, I reflected, if the tantalizing titan Satoshi gets out
    of the way. The Internet as a global copying machine cannot create money or other
    purely digital assets. Any transactions have to use institutions outside the Net,
    whether banks, credit card companies, or PayPal. Any digital item generated on
    the Net alone can be reproduced in unlimited quantities. In bitcoin, Satoshi made
    possible a digital asset that cannot be copied without lots of work, which he
    called “proof of work.” The proof of work is provided by miners laboriously checking
    out all the transactions and compiling them into blocks. Thus Satoshi enabled
    the creation of money on the Net and used the money to pay “miners” to validate
    its transactions. Recorded in a public distributed ledger, the transactions are
    mathematically “hashed” into chains of blocks that form an immutable database
    published across the Internet. Unchangeable records of transactions constitute
    a form of money. But governments do not like private money creation. So Satoshi
    carefully preserved his anonymity.

  zh: 我反思道，比特币也可以，只要诱人的巨人 Satoshi 不挡道。作为一个全球复制机器的互联网无法创造货币或其他纯数字资产。任何交易都必须使用互联网之外的机构，无论是银行、信用卡公司还是
    PayPal。在互联网上独立生成的任何数字物品都可以无限复制。在比特币中，Satoshi 实现了一种不能在没有大量工作的情况下复制的数字资产，他称之为“工作证明”。工作证明由矿工费力地检查所有交易并将它们编译成区块。因此，Satoshi
    实现了在互联网上创造货币，并用这些货币支付“矿工”来验证其交易。交易记录在一个公开的分布式账本中，这些交易被数学上“哈希”成链状区块，形成一个在互联网上发布的不可变数据库。不可更改的交易记录构成了一种货币形式。但政府不喜欢私人创造货币。因此，Satoshi
    谨慎地保护了他的匿名性。

    data from multiple transactions into specific-sized slots, where it is time-stamped
    and verified cryptographically. These mathematical hashes provide virtual fingerprints
    for large bodies of data, enabling every block of verified transactions to contain
    unique traces of all the transactions since Satoshi’s Genesis Block.
