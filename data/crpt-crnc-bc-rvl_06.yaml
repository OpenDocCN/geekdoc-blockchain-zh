- en: 'Where is blockchain today, and where is it going? To its critics, blockchain
    is little more than a speculative bubble—another power grab by technologists,
    a solution in search of a problem, and a system rife with errors. It’s vulnerable
    to thieves and hacks, or otherwise hopelessly compromised. But to its supporters,
    blockchain represents nothing less than a revolution. It establishes what makes
    human affairs work: truth, which leads to trust. It takes control of the internet
    back from the tech companies, gatekeepers, and totalitarian governments. In their
    eyes, the challenges and missteps of the past decade are to be expected given
    the enormity of blockchain’s potential.'

    otherwise 无可救药地受到破坏。但在其支持者看来，区块链代表了一场革命。它确立了人类事务成功的关键：真理，进而导致信任。它将互联网的控制权从科技公司、守门人和极权政府手中夺回。在他们看来，过去十年的挑战和挫折是区块链巨大潜力所预料之中的。

    two vastly different comparisons are inevitable: the tulip bulb and the internet,”
    observed a New York Times reporter. The tulip bulb craze occurred in the seventeenth
    century in the Netherlands, when speculators bid up the price of tulip flower
    bulbs on newly opened markets. The prices reached astronomical levels and then
    abruptly collapsed, and the tulip craze has become shorthand for speculative bubbles.
    The internet, on the other hand, was also a speculative bubble that popped in
    2000\. But it ultimately rewarded investors. “So what is it?” asks the article.

    newly opened markets 上推高了郁金香球茎的价格。价格达到了天文数字般的水平，然后突然崩溃，郁金香狂热成为了投机泡沫的代名词。另一方面，互联网在2000年也曾经是一个破裂的投机泡沫。但它最终给投资者带来了回报。“那么，这是什么？”文章问道。“我们还有几年才能弄清楚这项技术将如何融入世界。”

    of bits of data. Analysts and programs sift through this vast trove to glean insights.

    parties. The exchange can be made in private and is confined specifically to the

    of their data. Without blockchain, users typically log into a website with a specific
    ID name that is verified with a password. The user may think they own this experience.

    that could slow down, or even prevent, the transaction. The electrical company
    could sell its electricity only to individuals within a certain jurisdiction.
    The car company may negotiate to have its cars only serviced at specific charging
    stations. The telecom company may not allow the transaction unless it’s paid a
    special fee. And the current financial system—where exchanges of cash and securities

    or reputation to establish trust. It is easy to understand why totalitarian regimes

  zh: 随着世界对加密货币和区块链的理念的逐渐认同，中本聪大部分时间保持沉默和隐匿。事实上，自2011年12月以来，中本聪基本上已经消失了。在2014年3月6日，他们发送了一条简单的、五个字的信息——“我不是多里安·中本聪”。这是指多里安·中本聪，一个前美国中央情报局计算机编码员，在洛杉矶因为他的名字而被媒体围攻，被指认为比特币的创始人。那是真正的中本聪最后的公开信息。
- en: Many have speculated as to why Nakamoto has withdrawn from any kind of public
    life. The most obvious reason is that Nakamoto could be worth billions of dollars
    and, as such, a target for criminals. Another is that Nakamoto wants to keep as
    much focus on their creation, Bitcoin, as possible so that the system becomes
    more secure and trusted. Finally, however, Nakamoto may fear the collective power
    of governments, states, and financiers who sit atop the current system based on
    fiat currency. Given the threat Bitcoin may pose to this system—and the ways it
    has been useful to non-state actors such as criminals, drug traders, and terrorists—Nakamoto
    may be wise to keep themselves anonymous.

  zh: 许多人猜测中本聪为何从公众生活中退出的原因。最明显的理由是中本聪可能价值数十亿美元，因此成为犯罪分子的目标。另一个原因是中本聪希望将尽可能多的关注点放在他的创造物，比特币上，以便该系统变得更加安全和值得信赖。然而，最后，中本聪可能担心基于法定货币的当前系统的政府、国家和金融家的集体力量。考虑到比特币可能对这个系统构成的威胁——以及它对非国家行为者（如犯罪分子、毒品交易商和恐怖分子）的有用性——中本聪可能明智地保持自己的匿名。

    After falling in value by almost 75 percent in 2018, Bitcoin, against most expectations,

    from the world’s most important central bank: the US Federal Reserve. In January
