    work is eventually broken down into its constituent microtasks and that as these
    tasks become simpler and simpler, the skill set required to do them becomes less.
    As such, the eventual and inescapable conclusion is that there will be little
    to no specialisation as we currently recognise it and that virtually any task
    could be completed by virtually any individual. Complex microtasks can emerge
    from the ABC economy, but again, they will be broken down to simpler forms.

  zh: 我们已经看到，在算法、区块链和加密货币（ABC）经济中，工作最终被分解为其组成的微任务，并且随着这些任务变得越来越简单，完成它们所需的技能也变得越来越少。因此，最终不可避免的结论是，几乎没有我们当前认识的专业化，几乎任何任务都可以由任何个人完成。复杂的微任务可能会从ABC经济中出现，但同样，它们将被分解为更简单的形式。
- en: Surely then, this represents a classic race to the bottom. If any task can be
    completed by any individual to the same standard, then organisations need to only
    pay subsistence wages (or less) to get the microtask completed. This assumes though
    that the power relationships between the organisation and the Bitworker are weighted
    in favour of the organisation. In a microtask world, with the predicted increase
    in the volume of microtask, there will be few (if any) microtasks which will be
    standalone consequential for the Bitworker. In any economy, there are usually
    more workers than work hours to be completed, in a microtask economy this could
    very well be the other way around. Microtasks are expected to increase in number
    following the exponential pattern of the increase in computer power, worker numbers
    (even in the global ABC economy) following the pattern of human procreation are
    not expected to match this growth.

  zh: 那么，这无疑代表了一个典型的“向底部的竞争”。如果任何任务都可以由任何个人以相同的标准完成，那么组织只需要支付基本生活费（或更少）来完成微任务。不过，这假设组织和比特工作者之间的权力关系是偏向于组织的。在微任务世界中，随着预期中微任务量的增加，几乎不会有（如果有的话）对比特工作者具有独立重要性的微任务。在任何经济体中，通常都会有比工作时间更多的工人，但在微任务经济中，情况很可能完全相反。预计微任务数量将按照计算机性能增长的指数模式增加，工人数量（即使在全球ABC经济中也是如此）按照人类繁殖的模式并不预计能够匹配这种增长。

    this book, and remembering that the future we are proposing isn’t too distant,
    being the culmination of existing technologies and trends discussed in [chapter
    1](CH001.html), we need to assume that in terms of organisation the ABC future
    will look broadly similar to today. In a later chapter, we note that the effect

- en: Labour replacing technology has historically been feared, both by workers and
    the elites. Workers feared for their livelihoods and lifestyles and mass unemployment
    of workers and subsequent societal unrest. The Industrial Revolution occurred
    in the UK, when the landed elite was supplemented by the industrial elite, who
    had much to gain from mechanisation. The long-term economic gains of industrialisation
    would not necessarily felt that the workers of the Industrial Revolution. In the
    Industrial Revolution, notions of time, money and work were completely transformed;
    in Britain in 1770, most of the population could not even conceive of the idea
    of a factory, let alone working in one, but by 1830 millions of the population
    did. This societal shift changed the fundamental bedrock of the pre-industrial
    society, in particular, the idea of time. Prior to industrialisation, a craftsmen
    worked from home on their own machines and generally sold their outputs at a weekly
    market. Craftsmen knew there was only one thing to get the job done and they could
    work when they liked. They often worked long hours but they had total control
    over it and freedom that came with it. For this work, they earned middle incomes
    and had a reasonably comfortable traditional lifestyle, very similar to their
    parents and the generations that came before them. Then came mechanisation of
    factories, craftsmen simply couldn’t compete, factories in Adam Smith’s notions
    of specialisation to rapidly increase output. Craftsmen taking the whole product
    was not able to compete, for instance weavers in the Industrial Revolution saw,
    over a 30-year time period, their average wage falling from around 20 Shillings
    a week to around 5 Shillings. Traditional workers could not make sense of the
    factory system. They were being paid to work for a certain amount of hours or
    days, they were being paid for one process and not seeing the output they were
    creating. Ideas of money transferred from outputs to time, machines ran at constant
    levels of outputs and so you were paid for keeping the machine going for a certain
    period of time, again wholly unfamiliar concepts to the craftsmen. Previously,
    the idea of time was simply an endpoint which craftsmen had to get the output
    done by, now it was a regimented broken down technical process which resulted
    in less control, less freedom and less pay. This was a large structural change
    in society, and society needed to be prepared for the new mechanisation world.

  zh: 替代劳动力的技术在历史上一直受到工人和精英阶层的担忧。工人担心他们的生计和生活方式，以及工人的大规模失业和随后的社会动荡。工业革命发生在英国，当时土地上的精英阶层得到了工业精英阶层的补充，后者从机械化中获益匪浅。工业化的长期经济收益未必会被工业革命的工人所感受到。在工业革命中，时间、金钱和工作的观念完全被改变；在1770年的英国，大多数人甚至无法想象工厂的概念，更别说在其中工作了，但到了1830年，数百万人口已经能够了。这种社会转变改变了前工业社会的基本基石，尤其是时间的概念。在工业化之前，工匠们在家里用自己的机器工作，通常在每周的市场上销售他们的产品。工匠知道只有一件事才能完成工作，他们可以随心所欲地工作。他们经常工作很长时间，但他们完全掌握了它和随之而来的自由。为此工作，他们获得中等收入，并过着相当舒适的传统生活方式，与他们的父母和前几代人非常相似。然后工厂机械化，工匠们根本无法竞争，亚当·斯密的专业化概念迅速增加了产量。工匠无法竞争，例如工业革命中的织工在30年的时间里，他们的平均工资从每周约20先令下降到每周约5先令。传统工人无法理解工厂系统。他们被支付工作一定数量的小时或天数，他们被支付一个过程，却看不到他们所创造的产出。金钱的概念从产出转移到了时间上，机器以恒定的产出水平运行，因此你被支付的是保持机器运转一段时间的时间，对工匠来说这些都是完全陌生的概念。以前，时间的概念只是工匠必须在某个时间点完成产出，现在它是一个经过严格分解的技术过程，导致了更少的控制、更少的自由和更少的报酬。这是社会的一次巨大结构性变革，社会需要为新的机械化世界做好准备。周日学校的发展只是为了教导孩子们在特定时间到达特定地点。

    success in campaigning to bring jobs back. In 2013, Frey and Osborne found that
    47% of American jobs are at high risk of automation, we would suggest that risk

    the book, we looked at the journey of finance from traditional institutions and
    notions of finance, to the disruption of FinTech. We can conceptualise this journey
    to the ABC economy, in much the same way. We see TechFin as the final stage in
    this system, a new way of coordinating and generating financial activity, which
    will be replaced by the next systemic development. Likewise, we can conceptualise
    the journey of our economy, from a traditional capitalist system which innovates
    and reinvigorate itself, to automated and knowledge-based economy which shares
    the same foundations, structures and institutions, but with technology making
    the systems become more efficient, which in turn gets replaced, as technology
    doesn’t simply make existing systems more efficient, but wholly reinvents them.
    For a short-term journey than, we can learn lessons both from the Industrial Revolution
    and from much more recent history of automation and industrial decline. We can
    see how in particular, middle income wages can decline, and how those displaced
    by new technology, rarely regain the standards of income and security they had.
    Here of course is one barrier in the way of the eventual ABC economy, in a way
    that seemed unlikely even a few years ago, automation anxiety has entered the

    three or more generations of workers are not worse off. These protections, including
    improved welfare, potentially universal income and advanced and dynamic lifelong
    learning are discussed in the later chapters. Here we see great potential in new
    technology redesigning the world of work, the journey to get there without government

    payments for work from hyper-global organisations, with borderless, real time
    and infinitely divisible instant transactions. We can see that this is a future

    long-term employment, if not a job for life, with specialisms or skills that we
    trade for income, our human and social capital are all fluid ideas, how does one
    prepare for a world where work is constantly changing where the microtask you
    may be adept or highly skilled at disappears. Where the ideas of machine learning,
    big data and advanced analytics take our successful completion of a task process
    and replicate that successful completion and replicate the required skill set.
    What then does the worker in the ABC economy do to prepare to train? Ultimately,
    we need to examine the very notions of education, schooling, training, Further
    Education, Higher Education and developing proficiencies in one or two complementary
    areas and look further towards fundamental skill sets that can be used in the
    completion of a large range of processes and tasks. Total flexibility and adaptability
    is required to provide the outputs needed in the ABC economy, but the fundamental
    question is how to prepare a workforce for this. Instead of training programmes,
    schooling or university degrees in each of the themes we discussed earlier, it
    may be instead of becoming a composer, or an architect, or a web designer, one
    simply becomes a creative. Somebody specialising in coding, or accountancy, or
    banking, do they become a technical and so likewise, do the workers in the physical
    sphere simply train their bodies to become as close to autonomous production styles

  zh: 那么，在这个新的ABC世界中，ABC正在改变我们工作的方式，工作被分解为微任务，区块链提供了一个验证透明信息的平台，企业加密货币意味着我们可以从超级全球组织接受工作报酬，边界无关，实时且可无限细分的即时交易。我们可以看到，这是一个工作世界可能看起来非常不同的未来。如果我们现有的对长期就业的概念，即使不是一份终身工作，拥有我们为收入交换的专业知识或技能，以及我们的人力和社会资本都是流动的观念，那么一个人如何准备迎接一个工作不断变化的世界，其中你可能擅长或高超的微任务会消失呢？在这个ABC经济中，成功完成任务并复制所需技能集的机器学习、大数据和高级分析的思想将如何影响我们。那么，ABC经济中的工作者要如何准备和培训呢？最终，我们需要审视教育、学校教育、培训、继续教育、高等教育以及在一两个互补领域发展熟练技能的概念，并进一步探索在完成大范围的过程和任务时可以使用的基本技能集。在ABC经济中，需要提供所需的产出，但根本问题是如何为这样做的劳动力做好准备。与我们之前讨论的主题中的培训计划、学校教育或大学学位不同，也许成为一个作曲家、建筑师或网页设计师的人，只需成为一位创意人员。一个专门从事编码、会计或银行业务的人，他们会变成技术人员，因此，物理领域的工作者是否只需训练他们的身体，使其尽可能接近自主生产方式？当人类的身体需要与一系列自主微任务相配合时，这可能是必要的。人们可以想象未来，物理工作者将他们的方法与算法相匹配的能力将受到高度重视。

    is in terms of skill development. We postulate a considerable change in the post-school
    education, for advanced training, undergraduate degrees, master’s degrees, or
    even PhDs. We see a significant evolution in the microcourse and Massive Open
    Online Courses (MOOC)-type sphere.

  zh: 当我们看到教育和培训时，与今天相比的一个重大变化在于技能的发展。我们假设在校后教育中有一个相当大的变化，用于高级培训、本科学位、硕士学位，甚至博士学位。我们看到微课程和大规模在线开放课程（MOOC）类型领域的显著演变。
- en: For example, a worker looking at creative work may do free courses or a microcourse
    of values of an organisation, which would then qualify them to complete microtasks
    for that organisation. A car production firm, when wanting microtasks completed
    to support the advertising of their latest product, may require creative microtask
    completed within the attributes of that firm or for general car selling, that
    may in turn require a bit worker to undertake a significant amount of online courses.
    This training, one would expect, following the pattern of the ABC economy to reduce
    processes down to fundamentals, would be quick and concise, and designed to provide
    the human with the skills the algorithm needs. Potentially, with a nod to the
    system and structure we currently have, enough microtask training could accredit
    someone as a BA (Hons) Creative, BSc (Hons) Technical, etc.

- en: In this final section of this chapter, we discuss our personification of a worker
    in the ABC economy, a worker that we call the Bitworker, and one that positively
    interacts with the technological, online and economy. We wish to make it clear
    that we are not prophesying things or predicting the future. The ABC economy and
    the bit worker within it are, we think, possible futures, or possible scenarios.
    It is a fool’s errand to make direct predictions, the one prediction we can relatively
    confident of is that the future as presented in this book, will not look exactly
    like our writings. We are aiming to give an idea of the future of work and the
    future of working in a heavily automated, artificial intelligence (AI), algorithmically
    driven and Blockchain supported future. We hope scholars and practitioners and
    future workers themselves will continue to explore the themes presented. This
    is not the precise future, or even necessarily a probable one, we have looked
    at many aspects of regulation, policy and adaption to this technology, which will
    be required to provide a future similar to what we present. Even when we proposed
    this book, the development of technology has continued to outpace government and
    regulation. We can see anxiety around automation entering into the mainstream
    political debate, workers’ worry for their livelihoods is entering into the political
    discourse. Their arguments being presented around the nationalisation of large
    firms, to protect them (or to protect the worker) from further automation, proposes
    that taxes on robotics, popular warnings against the destructive potential of
    AI (both in the traditional sense and the employment sense), an unexpected election
    and referenda outcomes, which can be traced back to the correct idea of those
    left behind politically and economically, but primarily by the middle income lifestyle,
    being replaced by automation. The political will, protections and support, we
    have argued unnecessary to turn what we have termed the ABC economy, into their
    benefit for all, were not present in these communities or happenings. Workers
    displaced by automation, and an increasing pace in technological developments,
    were not offered sufficient welfare, credible training to regain skills to enter
    the new workplace or even psychological support. Workers in the left behind areas
    and industries rarely regained what they lost. In our future, we are suggesting
    displacements on a massive scale, and policy consideration needs to be given to
    ensure that the potential upside for all, this technological development, is not
    squandered. It is all too easy, too. The future where increasing automation (at
    least in the short term) gives rise to greater profitability and greater inequality.

  zh: 在本章的最后一节中，我们讨论了我们对 ABC 经济中工作者的拟人化，我们称之为比特工作者，并且与技术、在线和经济积极互动。我们希望明确一点，我们不是在预言事情或者预测未来。我们认为
    ABC 经济及其中的比特工作者是可能的未来，或者可能的场景。直接预测是愚蠢的事情，我们相对有信心的一项预测是，按照本书呈现的未来，未来看起来不会完全像我们的文字描述的那样。我们旨在提供未来工作和在高度自动化、人工智能（AI）、算法驱动和区块链支持的未来中工作的概念。我们希望学者、实践者和未来的工作者们能继续探索所呈现的主题。这不是精确的未来，甚至不一定是一个可能的未来，我们已经审视了对这种技术进行监管、政策和适应所需要的许多方面，这些都是为了提供与我们呈现的未来类似的未来。即使在我们提出这本书的时候，技术的发展仍在超越政府和监管。我们可以看到围绕自动化的焦虑进入了主流政治辩论，工人们为他们的生计而担心已经进入了政治话语之中。有关国有化大公司以保护它们（或保护工人）免受进一步自动化侵害的论点，以及对人工智能的破坏潜力（无论是传统意义上还是就业方面的意义）的普遍警告，以及出乎意料的选举和公投结果，都可以追溯到政治上和经济上被落下的人的正确理念，但主要是由于中等收入生活方式被自动化取代。我们已经主张的政治意愿、保护和支持，将
    ABC 经济转变为所有人的利益是不必要的，在这些社区或事件中都没有存在。自动化使工人受到替代，并且技术发展的速度不断加快，但他们没有得到足够的福利、可信的培训来重新获得进入新工作场所所需的技能，甚至连心理支持都没有。被落下的地区和行业的工人们很少能够重新找回失去的东西。在我们的未来中，我们提出了大规模的替代，政策上的考虑需要确保这种技术发展的潜在优势不会被浪费。这也太容易了。未来将会出现自动化程度增加（至少在短期内）导致利润增加和不平等加剧的情况。
- en: In order to convince the reader that the ABC is more than a revolution of the
    economy as we know it, we must explore the argument that the ABC is an institutional
    technology, or convergence of institutional technologies, that the ABC is actually
    a new way of generating and coordinating economic output and activity. This simply
    means the ABC is wholly a new type of economic structure and not simply a production
    exchange efficiency improvement, this is a whole new economic structure, not simply
    improvements to the structure which we currently inhabit.

    ABC 完全是一种新型经济结构，而不仅仅是生产交换效率的改进，这是一个全新的经济结构，而不仅仅是对我们目前居住的结构的改进。
- en: The world of work with the future could be structurally, societally, politically,

    We argue that the ultimate end of the ABC supertrends is a world of work where
    worker from today, where they transported into it, would find little familiarity.
    We hope to position this book in opposition to Amara’s Law, where the effects
    of new technology are overestimated (hype) in the short run and underestimated
    in the long run. We are taking a long position on the effects of algorithms, blockchain
    and critical which attempts to see past their current type and look at their long-term
    effects, in particular the long-term effects of their convergence.

  zh: 未来的工作世界可能在结构、社会、政治、组织和经济上与今天完全不同。很难想象一个不同的未来，而不仅仅是对现在的延伸或变化。我们认为 ABC 超级趋势的最终目标是一个工作世界，在那里，今天的工作者如果被传送进去，会发现几乎没有熟悉的东西。我们希望将这本书定位为与阿玛拉定律相对立，该定律中对新技术的影响被高估（炒作）在短期内，并在长期内被低估。我们对算法、区块链和批判性的影响持有长期看好的立场，试图超越它们当前的类型，并着眼于它们的长期影响，特别是它们的融合的长期影响。

    – in the con joint schemas of Hayek, Williamson, Buchanan, North and Ostrom –
    of firms, markets, Commons, clubs, relational contracts and governments, and that
    these institutions collectively furnish money, war, property rights, contract
    and finance through organisations and networks of production exchange (Hodgson,
    2015). But since 2009, there has been an additional mechanism for groups of people
    to coordinate their economic activity, i.e. through the institutional mechanism
    of a block chain. (Davidson, De Filippi, & Potts, 2018, p. 641 )*'

  zh: 我们的论点是，直到 2009 年，资本主义的经济制度由海耶克、威廉姆森、布坎南、诺斯和奥斯特罗姆的联合模式组成，包括公司、市场、公共领域、俱乐部、关系合同和政府，这些制度通过生产交换的组织和网络提供货币、战争、财产权、合同和金融（霍奇森，2015
    年）。但自 2009 年以来，人们协调经济活动的另一种机制是通过区块链的制度机制。（戴维森，德·菲利皮，波茨，2018 年，第 641 页）
- en: In many ways, our proposal for the ABC economy demonstrates post-industrial
    structures being replaced by new technological ones. Returning to our analogy
    from finance and banking, of (1) traditional institutions, moving to a (2) FinTech
    system which in turn moves to (3) a TechFin system. Remember crucially, whilst
    the aims of one and three are the same, the structures and processes and operations
    of three are unrecognisable to one. If we consider the post-Industrial Revolution
    to structure of economic output to akin to stage I, that is the traditional financial
    institution, we can see that, the stage roughly from 1967 (with the launch of
    the first handheld calculator, and thus the precursor to today’s smart phone)
    to the near future. Stage II is that of FinTech, where often significant technological
    innovations are driving efficiencies and productivity in broadly the traditional
    institutions structure. Then we can postulate a future stage akin to TechFin,
    which results in a potential future characteristics not dissimilar to those described
    in this book. Of course, the journey of activity is dynamic, and we are not suggesting
    that our TechFin stage is the last one, this will probably be a continual journey
    based around the circular pattern of traditional institution, technological efficiency
    to that system, and then fundamental structural developments occurring to produce
    a new system of output, activity and coordination.

  zh: 在很多方面，我们对ABC经济的提议展示了后工业结构被新技术结构所取代。回到我们在金融和银行业中的类比，即(1) 传统机构，转向(2) 金融科技系统，然后再转向(3)
    TechFin系统。关键记住，尽管一和三的目标是相同的，但三的结构、流程和操作对一来说是无法识别的。如果我们将经济产出的后工业革命结构类比为第一阶段，也就是传统金融机构，我们可以看到，从1967年（随着第一台手持计算器的推出，因此是今天智能手机的前身）到近期的阶段。第二阶段是金融科技，其中经常出现重大的技术创新，广泛地提高了传统机构的效率和生产力。然后我们可以假设一个未来类似于TechFin的阶段，这将导致未来特征与本书中描述的特征相似。当然，活动的过程是动态的，我们并不是在暗示我们的TechFin阶段是最后一个阶段，这可能是一个基于传统机构、技术效率到该系统的循环模式，然后产生基本结构发展以产生新的产出、活动和协调的持续旅程。

  zh: 结论
- en: This chapter imagines the future of work from the perspective of the worker,
    or as we term them, the ‘Bitworker’, in this new global economy. We use the phrase
    global economy as we believe that, with a small number of geographic and physical
    barriers, this new platform-based way of working, will be as global as we can
    conceptualise. The sellers of online work, the organisations, governments and
    cooperatives of the future could, in effect, be located anywhere or nowhere and
    be online entities with zero physical infrastructure or human infrastructure,
    a further headache for the state and a huge consideration for future research.
    In effect, a Bitworker in the UK could be working for anyone, and ultimately we
    doubt they will even know who they are, with trust in the platform, facilitated
    by blockchain smart contracts and globally acceptable cryptocurrencies, supporting
    this. The technological infrastructure to support this way of working, already
    exists; blockchain and cryptocurrency simply make it easier to do. In a world
    where the process to produce an output or service is reduced to its component
    or fundamental process, it is a reasonable judgement that the skill set required
    to produce this output decreases (as the number of microtasks increases). This
    is the specialisation of which we are already familiar but sped up and ruthlessly
    efficient. This chapter explores how in a world where skill need decreases, a
    worker is still able to thrive and differentiate themselves. We draw parallels
    with the wholesale changes from pre-industrial to industrial worker and query
    if in some ways the ABC marks a return to a quasi-pre-industrial style of working.

  zh: 本章从工作者（或者我们所称之为“比特工作者”）的角度想象了未来工作的情景，在这个新的全球经济中。我们使用“全球经济”一词，因为我们相信，在很少的地理和物理障碍下，这种新的基于平台的工作方式将是我们能够概念化的全球化。在线工作的销售者、未来的组织、政府和合作社实际上可以位于任何地方或无处，成为零物理基础设施或人力基础设施的在线实体，这对于国家来说是又一个头痛，并且是未来研究的重要考虑因素。实际上，英国的比特工作者可以为任何人工作，最终我们怀疑他们甚至不会知道自己在为谁工作，通过对区块链智能合约和全球可接受的加密货币的信任来支持这一点。支持这一方式工作的技术基础已经存在；区块链和加密货币只是使其更易于实现。在一个将产出或服务的过程简化为其组成或基本过程的世界中，判断需要的技能集减少（随着微任务数量的增加），这是一个合理的判断。这是我们已经熟悉的专业化，但速度加快且高效无情。本章探讨了在技能需求减少的世界中，工作者仍然能够蓬勃发展并区别自己的方式。我们将与从前工业时代到工业时代工人的全面变革相类比，并质疑在某些方面ABC是否标志着回归到准工业化的工作方式。
