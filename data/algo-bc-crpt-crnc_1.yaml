    of self-employability at the expense of job security and the guaranteed availability
    of short to medium term paid work. Similar to the previously discussed platform
    businesses, we predict the increase in the usage of such business structures looking
    to connect the availability of Bitworkers with the skill shortages and potential
    providers of both work and consequential payment. Matching of this human resource
    may take place using a blockchain system which is able to connect mutually interested
    parties without the need for a centralised trusted arbiter.

    Bitworker 的可用性与技能短缺以及潜在的工作和相应支付提供者。这种人力资源的匹配可以通过区块链系统进行，该系统能够连接互相感兴趣的各方，无需中央信任的仲裁者。

    or other such variables, whereby a worker may seek to advertise their availability
    across multiple blockchain exchanges concurrently subject to the rules of membership
    of each respective blockchain. Expanding upon the *digital cooperative* (DCOP)
    proposed in [Chapter 2](CH002.html), such labour exchanges may become not-for-profit
    vehicles sponsored by the state, regions, trade professions or even by private
    corporations. In contrast, it is feasible to envisage profit seeking alternatives
    which purport to provide superior or more exclusive opportunities in return for
    a larger membership fee which could accrue to shareholder, members or a mixture
    of both.

- en: In the absence of a centralised arbiter, such exchanges could be termed a decentralised
    exchange (DEX), which is relatively a new technology that seeks to mitigate the
    risk of mistrust and misdemeanour by a centralised body. DEXs permit peer-to-peer
    exchange of value. Presently, they are almost exclusively used for the trading
    of cryptocurrencies. One such example is Ether Delta whose founder made settlement

    likely involve significant *Know Your Client* (KYC) vetting. This would become
    increasingly important for safety critical professions requiring such surety and
    perhaps even full transparency for the respective regulators, where it was in
    the interest of the public and wider society. The underlying blockchain technology,
    although just a variant of a database, lends itself well to such a matching process
    (of labour) which requires real-time access for multiple stakeholders recorded
    in an immutable audit trail.^([1](#fn1)) It is this audit trail which will offer
    transparency to current and potential members (Bitworkers) and potential contract
    hirers. Essentially, a system delivers trust from mistrust. However, with the
    absence of a centralised arbiter, a decentralised financial (or *DeFin*) solution
    will be required to maintain the accuracy and robustness of this ledger, or audit
    trail. It is possible that this could be done using a decentralised mining pool
    of validating nodes, similar to that of Bitcoin, leaving the labour exchange exposed
    only to a 51% attack from a targeted hack perhaps through the use of quantum computing

- en: For tax authorities such as HMRC in the UK and the IRS in the USA, the existence
    of pseudo-anonymous systems, such as Bitcoin, and the existence of blockchain-enabled
    communities which permit users to transfer value outside of existing regulatory
    structures pose a headache to say the least. It is therefore possible that such
    *decentralised labour exchanges* (DLEXs) will require authorisation from arbiters
    such as national and international regulators. Following on from this reasoning,
    it is plausible that such *DEX* permissions will be preconditioned by the veil
    of anonymity or pseudo-anonymity being lifted to mitigate the risk of tax evasion
    with respect to consequential work obtained and performed in this manner. From
    August 2019, the IRS and HMRC are engaged in contacting individuals suspected
    of failing to declare their historical gains from cryptocurrency trading. Many
    believe that such an agenda is impossible given the pseudo-anonymous nature of
    the technology. However, forced disclosure of KYC information held by cryptocurrency
    exchanges is facilitating this effort by tax authorities. Much of this may be
    a public relations strategy rather than a meaningful attempt to claw back hitherto
    untaxed gains from the shadow economy but nonetheless must be a consideration
    in our evaluation of the future viability for DEXs of labour.

    of contract sizes and durations, etc. This is the case currently for precious
    metal exchanges such as The New York Mercantile Exchange and COMEX, the equivalent
    for commodities. For our hypothesised labour exchange, a common unit of work would
    need to be predefined. This may be a previously discussed *Bit task*, a unit of
    chargeable time (e.g. an hour/day/week), or a predefined project which itself
    may be bespoke in nature. Much of the nature of standardisation will depend upon
    the skill level of workers and the needs of potential contract hire firms. Furthermore,
    the transparency and trust afforded by the blockchain infrastructure would give
    a potential contract hire firm full visibility to the concurrent workload for
    an individual worker both historically and at the present time. This could potentially
    also include worker reviews and endorsements, not too dissimilar to a LinkedIn
    plus type system, which thereby becomes an immutable CV to better aid evaluation
    and hiring. Indeed, future work or contract commitments by worker or provider
    of work could be made available too where appropriate.

    the conditions of sale or purchase agreed, for example, 90 days after date of
    invoice. However, alternatives do exist such as approval by both parties, or even
    approval by an additional third party. Similarly, AI and oracles can be used to
    validate that a particular event has occurred in order to release funds based
    upon external data sources. If it can be imagined and coded then it is possible.
    The advantage may not be immediately obvious but in a hard coded world where money
    is paid exactly when it should be there is no delay in payments being made, no
    money lost in chasing bad debts and businesses is consequently more likely to
    succeed subject to their cash forecasting calculations being correct. An improvement

    as this role is now fulfilled more cheaply and accurately by an impartial smart
    contract. Moreover, this can now be a viable approach on a much smaller scale

    we envisage a world with greater employment through more companies succeeding

    Often expensive and poor value for a demographic of society with little choice
    to obtain finance elsewhere. Legislation has therefore sought to protect their
    vulnerability, for example, in the UK in 2014, interest rates on such loans were
    capped at 0.8% per day by the regulator, The Financial Conduct Authority. In contrast,
    the Netherlands limited this to 12% over the base rate whereas Australia chose

    arrangement, the user still has the rights to the underlying Ethereum and can
    at any point during the life of the CDP redeem the Ethereum by returning the DAI
    coins originally issued. This permits the volatility of Ethereum to be traded
    away for the stability of the DAI coin without giving up the upside potential
    of the underlying Ethereum price movements. In contrast, should the price of the
    underlying Ethereum fall beyond the buffer of the aforementioned haircut then
    the CDP is automatically liquidated in order to preserve the integrity of the
    one DAI to one US dollar peg. An innovative piece of decentralised financial engineering
    which vastly reduces the scale requirement of the securitisation industry which
    historically has required underlying asset values in the hundreds of millions
    of dollars to warrant the expense of establishment and maintenance. This industry

    Dao平台上以分散的方式进行的，在那里用户可以将他们的以太坊存入定制的抵押债务头寸（CDPs）中，以换取价值低于抵押品以太坊的DAI硬币，减去一个减价。类似于典当安排，用户仍然拥有底层以太坊的权利，并且在CDP的生命周期内的任何时候，可以通过退还最初发行的DAI硬币来赎回以太坊。这允许以太坊的波动性以DAI硬币的稳定性交换，而无需放弃底层以太坊价格波动的上升潜力。相比之下，如果底层以太坊的价格跌破上述减价的缓冲区，那么CDP将自动清算，以维护一个DAI对一美元的挂钩的完整性。这是一种创新的分散式金融工程，大大降低了证券化行业的规模要求，这个行业通常需要数亿美元的基础资产价值来保证设立和维护的费用。这个行业通常专注于大型非流动资产，例如无抵押贷款池、房地产（房地产投资信托基金）和抵押贷款业务。MAKR

- en: Notwithstanding the above detrimental impacts to the worker of the future, the
    power of choice of work and physical domicile accrues to the worker. The organisations
    of the future must therefore adapt to align their talent resourcing accordingly.
    Perhaps most challengingly will be how such workers of the future will be managed
    and their interests aligned with that of the organisation. It has long been understood
    that a problem of agency, known as *agency theory* exists to between the misalignment
    of interests between directors and shareholders. Perhaps more worryingly a greater
    misalignment, at least in aggregate, may now exist between shareholders and their
    increasingly fragmented Bitworker labour force. Such workers may be working concurrently
    across multiple employers raising concerns for employers around commercial sensitivity
    and competitiveness as well as the risk that a different employer is being prioritised
    at your expense in the Bitworker’s work portfolio. Moreover, such Bitworkers will
    be engaged in microtasks or Bit tasks which by definition will be short term in
    duration. These workers will then be spending time sourcing future engagements
    before their present engagement concludes perhaps to the detriment of their work
    effort, which you are paying for. Such Bitworkers are likely to be temporally
    sensitive in that they prioritise decisions and project implementation which either
    increases the likelihood of being hired again going forward or perhaps ensuring
    that gains and favourable feedback accrue to them in the short term rather than
    a different Bitworker further down the line. Regardless, such sub-optimal decision
    making, although rational for the Bitworker, is detrimental to shareholder interests.
    Famous examples of such myopia leading to poor decision making by Directors include
    the ponzi schemes of Bernie Maddoff and the regulatory and accounting breaches
    of Enron leading to a jail sentence and an ultimate corporate collapse, respectively.
    These agency problems are however less frequent as the actions of board directors
    are heavily scrutinised by analysts and the wider markets, particularly for larger
    listed organisations. We do however note the trend towards, relatively inconsequential
    fines for wrong doing, where an organisation accepts an initial fine rather than
    face further investigation. In effect they have the ability to buy off scrutiny.
    This is compounded by the ‘newness’ of, particularly data and privacy scandals.
    The law here is still evolving and legal definitions of a crime lag behind societal
    ones. It is interesting to note how consumer and societal action can have a far
    greater effect on moderating and limiting negative organisational behaviours than
    legal or regulatory pressure. The unique challenge of the agency problem at the
    Bitworker level, termed *operational agency theory* (OAT), is that for a single
    worker it is much smaller scale and therefore more difficult to identify, not
    to mention manage and correct for. Importantly though, the aggregate effect of
    such agent-based failings may be greater than that of traditional agency theory
    at board level thereby acting as a sustained drag on corporate performance. This
    hypothesised OAT drag may serve as a natural brake on the fragmentation of the
    labour force thereby incentivising organisations to maintain a larger proportion
    of permanent employed workers than they might otherwise choose to do so going
    forward.

- en: A further way which organisations may manage Bitworkers in the future is with
    the use of derivatives.^([8](#fn8)) The future availability and price of skills

    Where new risk occurs financial engineering and secondary markets soon follow
    thereby facilitating the repackaging and sale of risk between parties who do not
    wish to suffer it compared to those that will in return for a fee. The consequential
    creation of derivatives denominated in worker time by profession is then entirely
    possible. The purchase of a futures contract on 10,000 hours of solicitor time
    at a rate of £300.00 per hour during quarter one 2020 in the Northwest of the
    UK is possible and of clear commercial value to a large law firm in Manchester
    such as DLA Piper or Eversheds Sutherland (International).^([9](#fn9)) In contrast,
    a call option on 4,000 mining hours in Western Australia during the next fiscal
    year for a rate of AUD$ 100.00 per hour would be of interest to the likes of BHP
    Billiton or Rio Tinto.^([10](#fn10)) Invariably, speculators would follow who
    would trade labour by profession and regions owing to shifting local, regional
    and macroeconomic needs although it may be some time before we see labour desks
    on the trading floor of leading investment banks such as Goldman Sachs. Perhaps
    more likely would be the emergence of exclusion or block-out provisions which
    would give comfort to employers whilst compensating workers who allow them to
    dominate their time. A potential win-win for both parties but a provision which
    is likely only to be afforded to the more highly skilled professions and those
    where previous employer feedback and ratings are particularly high. This may put
    further pressure on the disaffected areas of our global societies who perceive,

  zh: 尽管如此，马绍尔群岛仍然是一个国家，尽管相对较小。因此，它有权发行自己的货币，因此可以认为，作为地理规模的一个单位，这项规定不能再进一步。如果你这样认为就错了。全球各地都存在城市和地区级别的货币。例如，在英国，我们有：布里斯托尔镑，湖区镑和利物浦镑。事实上，全球存在许多这样的例子，包括但不限于：阿尔伯塔省的卡尔加里美元，费城的平等美元，墨西哥Espinal的Tumin货币，希腊Volos的TEMs货币和纽约的伊萨卡小时货币。货币的这种碎片化带来了标准化和因此对用户的实用性的问题，因为货币是一个谁受益的工具。然而，对于明天的工作者来说，他们的时间是他们自己的，因此在一个未来的世界中，通过DLEXs可以测量和在二级市场交易他们的货币价值的世界，有什么可以阻止他们的相应时间单位被代币化呢？
- en: Continuing this thought experiment, perhaps an incremental phase in this trend
    towards the *securitised self* will be banding of uniform labour units. As previously
    discussed, this standardisation of labour is essential for the pragmatic pricing
    and operation of exchanges, and corresponding derivatives where such things may
    one day be traded.

    view* as the management consultants would say. Thus far, we have defined many
    different forms of future money which have broadly wrapped under the umbrella
    title of *cryptocurrencies*. They are as follows and are depicted over the page
    as part of the continuing story of the evolution of money ([Fig. 2](#fig2)).

- en: '[Fig. 2](#fig2) depicts the evolution of money over time both backwards and
    forward looking. The future of money is split into four ways between: (1) decentralised
    cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin; (2) Corporate-issued non-sovereign currencies
    such as Facebook’s Libra; (3) the securitised self – a hypothesised tokenisation
    of professional labour time; and (4) CBDCs – central bank-issued digital currencies,
    for example, the crypto pound. The latter again is a theoretical construct rather
    than a present reality. This chapter aimed to evaluate the future of money and
    to whom the gains of monetary policy control would accrue. The four scenarios
    shown above are not mutually exclusive and in truth it is a difficult call to
    make in quarter four 2019\. For Bitcoin and the other permissionless *alt coins*,
    we have seen a potential bubble then subsequent decline, but these currencies
    have yet to dissipate and the reluctance to depart from the plausible future is
    noted. Alternatively, the corporate-issued non-sovereign coins attract perhaps
    the most media and political attention, not least in part due to Facebook’s Libra.
    It should however be noted that JP Morgan’s institutional currency is effectively
    the institutional equivalent to Libra’s offering to the retail market. A more
    palatable offering that arguably flies under the radar. In contrast, the securitised
    self is perhaps the furthest from our present reality. A technological possibility
    which is consistent with the alignment of the current trend for increasingly short
    units of time for worker tasks. A concept which we have termed the *Bit task*.
    Finally, CBDCs represent the institutional repost to the threat of cryptocurrencies
    such as Bitcoin. Most central banks globally are exploring the mechanics of how
    such a currency would integrate into the current international economic systems.
    It is the opinion of these writers that corporates are unlikely to miss this opportunity
    without a fight. We as global consumers spend directly with corporates rather
    than governments. The latter tends to be indirect spending via taxation. For this
    reason, on balance, it is perhaps the corporates who will steal the day and therefore
    the spoils of what may become the next phase of globalisation. The ability to
    sell goods and services to consumers along with the monetary system which is used
    to purchase them. Central bank beware!'

    - 这是一种假设的职业劳动时间的代币化；以及（4）央行发行的数字货币，例如加密英镑。后者再次是一种理论构想，而不是当前的现实。本章旨在评估货币的未来以及货币政策控制的收益归属于谁。上述四种情景并不是互斥的，事实上在2019年第四季度很难作出决定。对于比特币和其他无权限的*替代币*，我们看到了潜在的泡沫，然后是随后的下降，但这些货币尚未消失，不愿意摆脱可信的未来。相反，公司发行的非主权货币吸引了最多的媒体和政治关注，部分原因是Facebook的Libra。然而，应该注意的是，摩根大通的机构货币实际上是机构等同于利博拉提供给零售市场的。一个更可接受的提议，可以说是悄悄进行。相比之下，证券化的自我可能是最远离我们当前现实的。这是一种技术可能性，与当前趋势对工人任务的时间单位越来越短的趋势一致。我们称之为*Bit任务*的概念。最后，央行数字货币代表了对诸如比特币之类的加密货币威胁的机构回应。全球大多数央行正在探索这种货币将如何融入当前国际经济体系的机制。这些作者认为，公司不太可能错过这个机会而不进行斗争。作为全球消费者，我们直接与公司交易，而不是与政府。后者往往是通过税收间接支出。基于这个原因，总体上，也许是公司会赢得今天，从而赢得可能成为全球化下一阶段的战利品。销售商品和服务给消费者以及用于购买它们的货币体系。中央银行要小心了！'
