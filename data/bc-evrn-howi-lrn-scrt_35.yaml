    Listen.” He fished his tea bag out of his mug and set it on a ceramic tea bag

    vocabulary: ‘This too shall pass.’ ”'

    Everything is taken from him—his work, his wealth, his family—and he just endures
    the most horrific things. He struggles to survive, to find meaning in this suffering,
    and he watches some of his fellow inmates just give up. He describes it like a
    light leaving their eyes. And within three days, they die.”
