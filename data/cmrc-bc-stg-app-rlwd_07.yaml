    some of the current issues organizations are facing. When I say ‘solve’, I am
    giving you the practical advice to help solve the issues; obviously, the actual
    solving of these issues will depend on many factors, including your organization
    and how you actually implement these solutions.

    when dealing with business, governments, communities, and processes. I would argue
    that trust has never really existed in most cases.

  zh: 我们生活在一个非常复杂的世界中，当涉及到商业、政府、社区和流程时，信任已经减少，往往蒸发。我认为在大多数情况下，信任实际上从未真正存在。
- en: For example, for a retailer, there is the challenge to trust the suppliers and
    the partners in the supply chain. The supply chain is key to the success of a
    retailer, but there is always an underlying mistrust in the data and the transactions.
    This leads to a significant level of wasted time and resources on proving who
    has the current data and who is correct.

  zh: 例如，对于零售商来说，挑战之一是信任供应链中的供应商和合作伙伴。供应链对零售商的成功至关重要，但总是对数据和交易存在潜在的不信任。这导致大量时间和资源被浪费在证明谁拥有当前数据和谁正确上。
- en: Another great example is intercompany – within any global organization, there
    will always be discrepancies in data between the entities, firstly due to the
    old legacy systems, and secondly, due to the differing structures and competing
    priorities of each entity.

  zh: 另一个伟大的例子是公司间的——在任何全球性组织内部，总是存在实体间数据的差异，首先是因为旧的遗留系统，其次是因为每个实体的不同结构和竞争优先级。
- en: All this lack of trust means that organizations spend significant amounts of
    time and resources on auditing and reconciling data – this is carried out after
    the transaction has been shared and reported. More importantly, the data is reconciled
    and audited after decisions have been made – this means that organizations are
    making decisions based on incorrect data.

  zh: 所有这种缺乏信任意味着组织在审计和对数据进行协调方面投入了大量时间和资源——这是在交易被共享和报告之后进行的。更重要的是，数据在决策之后进行协调和审计——这意味着组织是基于错误的数据做出决策。
- en: If we agree that trust does not exist (whether it did in the first place or
    not is irrelevant), then we should start to implement Blockchain technology at
    speed; the main solution of Blockchain is to improve trust between parties who
    do not trust each other.

    交易自动化 - 智能合约

    certain transactions and tasks – often called smart contracts. In basic terms,
    these are the same as computer programming language, where people write simple
    code in an executable language.

    to expire at a certain time each month (e.g. prepayments and accruals). These
    transactions are often reversed at the start of each month and then set up again
    at the end of each month. We could write a smart contract to automatically reverse
    the transaction and check the data on the end of the next month to automatically
    post again (if the transaction meets agreed criteria).
