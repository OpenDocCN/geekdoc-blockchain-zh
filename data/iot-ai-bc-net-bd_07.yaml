    Punjab, IndiaIn last decade, we have seen the emergence of various computer technologies,
    each of which was disrupting and revolutionary. Some of these technologies paved
    the way for a newer generation of technologies to make our lives easier. Some
    of these technologies are in the category of invention, as they change and disrupt
    the entire ecosystem. There was a big wave that produced a lot of new billionaires
    and millionaires. What was available for just 2 cents in 2009 is now available
    for more than $15,000 US. Yes, we are talking about Bitcoin and Blockchain. Blockchain
    is the technology behind Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency and especially Bitcoin have certainly
    divided the world into two zones—one that supports cryptocurrency and the other
    that opposes it. The use of cryptocurrency has been such a craze that there are
    around 1400+ cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in the market, having more than 17+
    million accounts. People have raised doubts about the future of Bitcoin. A few
    countries don’t allow cryptocurrencies in their economies, but almost all of them
    have provided tremendous support for Blockchain. Bitcoin is just one of the finest
    implementations of Blockchain, but Blockchain is certainly going to stay and is
    currently transforming the way we trust across work and business.Until this point,
    we have assumed the role of intermediaries to be important. They are part of our
    core ecosystem of daily life. Everything that we do, such as buying vegetables
    or buying a house, getting an insurance claim, signing a contract, or even booking
    a hotel destination for our upcoming vacation, includes intermediaries. Apart
    from bringing a few advantages, it also brings several disadvantages, like cost,
    lack of transparency, and brokerage percentages. Wouldn’t it be great if we had
    a technology that reduced all intermediaries? Wouldn’t it benefit the producer
    and the consumer? Yes, this technology has arrived and it’s called Blockchain.
    Bitcoin and the rise of cryptocurrency is possible with the technology behind
    it, which we call Blockchain. Blockchain and Bitcoin are so interrelated that
    a lot of times people use these terms interchangeably. Well before we go further
    and drill down more in detail, let’s understand how Blockchain is not Bitcoin.In

- en: Since the evolution of mankind, there has been various types of exchanges, each
    of which has pros and cons. Back in 6,000 BC, it all started with the barter system.
    The barter system is about trading services and goods. It was definitely a good
    system—a person was required to produce or offer services that he is specialists
    in and then exchange those for the goods that he/she requires. The barter system
    continued successfully for centuries but had a few fundamental flaws including
    the absence of a common unit of value for exchange. This results in creating a
    different valuation for the different exchange of good. For example, buying a
    few apples in exchange of a liter of milk might be good, but the same liter of
    milk might not be traded for rice. It requires a new valuation, which may or may
    not be accepted by all parties involved. Apart from this, few of the goods were
    perishable in nature and few goods were large and heavy, making them transport-unfriendly.
    Another flaw with the barter system was proof of ownership. There was no way to
    tie goods to a person. These flaws led to the emergence of the gold coins era.

    of the basic and fundamental problems with the barter system. For example, gold
    coins serve as a common unit of value. Now a certain number of goods could be
    exchanged with a gold coin. Gold is also non-perishable in nature and can be easily
    transportable. Gold coins also have a couple of flaws, primarily that they are
    expensive and insecure. Anyone can easily steal gold coins. Moreover, it was not
    easy to mine gold. All of these issues led to paper-based currency, aka FIAT currency.

  zh: FIAT Currency
- en: The paper currency era started around 960 AD. During the initial days of paper
    currency, people deposited gold coins to third-party financial corporations. Some
    of these financial parties are now called banks. In lieu of gold coins, these
    third party gave IOU notes, which were treated as standard currency notes. These
    IOU notes were also termed the first form of FIAT currency.TipFIAT currency is
    the standard currency being supported by government regulations and institution.
    Currencies like the Dollar, Yen, Rupee, Euro, Pound, etc., are current FIAT currencies.
    We use FIAT currency terminology later in the due course of the chapter.People
    who have these IOU notes can exchange them for goods. There are many advantages
    to using paper currency. It is lighter than gold and easy to mine. It was initially
    backed by a tangible commodity like gold, and later by an intangible commodity
    like banks and governments that issue these notes. All the government institutions
    that back various currencies have a standard acceptance of exchange rates. FIAT
    currency has been used across the world in one form or another, as shown in Figure
    [7-1](#Fig1).![A458845_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    7-1Some of the currently used FIAT currenciesIn spite of paper currency being
    successful and used currently as well, it has its flaws. FAIT currency is unsecured,
    inflationary, and untraceable. There is no way you can tie paper currency to a
    person. Anyone can steal your currency and use it again. Government institutions
    backing currency have no way of knowing who owns the currency. Once the currency  is
    in the market, there is absolutely no way to trace it. This can create a lot of
    inflation in the market, leading to economic issues like black money hoarding
    and parallel economies. Some of the countries also use demonetization drives to
    replace the running currency with new currency notes to stop creating parallel
    economy.

  zh: 纸币时代始于公元960年左右。在纸币初期，人们将金币存入第三方金融公司。其中一些金融方如今被称为银行。这些第三方以IOU票据的形式取代金币，这些票据被视为标准货币。这些IOU票据也被称为第一种法定货币形式。提示：法定货币是由政府法规和机构支持的标准货币。像美元、日元、卢比、欧元、英镑等都是当前的法定货币。我们将在本章后面用到法定货币术语。持有这些IOU票据的人可以用它们来换取商品。使用纸币有许多优点。它比金重，容易开采。最初是以有形商品如金作为支撑，后来是以发行这些票据的无形商品如银行和政府为支撑。支持各种货币的政府机构都有标准的汇率接受度。法定货币一直以某种形式在全球范围内使用，如图[7-1](#Fig1)所示。![A458845_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg)图7-1目前使用的一些法定货币尽管纸币目前仍然成功并被广泛使用，但它也有其缺陷。法定货币不安全、通货膨胀且无法追踪。你无法将纸币与某人联系起来。任何人都可以偷取你的货币并再次使用。支持货币的政府机构无法知道谁拥有货币。一旦货币进入市场，就绝对无法追踪。这可能导致市场上出现大量通货膨胀，引发经济问题，如黑钱囤积和平行经济。一些国家还通过废钞行动用新的货币替换流通中的货币，以阻止平行经济的产生。

    medium in the market, i.e. checks. The first checks were created in 1717 AD. Checks
    resolve some of the issues with currency and have quite a lot of similarity with
    existing cryptocurrency. First and foremost, they resolved the security issue.
    Checks contain the sender’s and receiver’s identities. Checks also used a very
    elementary form of cryptography (i.e., the signature) to validate the actual sender,
    as shown in Figure [7-2](#Fig2). Each check can have a different value than any
    others, which means two checks can have different amounts. Checks were successful
    in resolving some of the vital issues with previous medium exchanges.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure

    time. Consider a normal case, when a buyer needs a good and he issues a check
    in lieu of getting those goods. The buyer gets the good but the seller now has
    to verify the authenticity of the check only when the seller’s bank talks with
    the buyer bank and gets the clearance of debt. Currently, check clearance takes
    from 1-4 working days. There are chances that the check is fraudulent and in practical
    scenarios, the seller now needs to chase the buyer. Checks  also have a very basic
    version of cryptography, via the signature, but that can easily be forged.

    biggest issues with checks. It can easily be installed and accessed from any device,
    including mobile devices. By using various mobile biometric and IRIS security
    measures, the validating transaction can reach the highest level of security compared
    to using signatures on checks. As there is no paper currency involved, it’s easy
    for a regulatory authority to track the transaction and track the money usage
    and its supply. It thereby reduces illegal money uses and black money hoarding.

    addresses all the concerns with the medium exchange. The biggest problem with
    e-wallet is that it is still tied up with an existing financial structure. Now
    if you remember the financial crisis back in 2008, you will know that financial
    systems can have a good degree of corruption. The financial crisis of 2008 was
    considered the largest recession since 1929\. The subprime mortgage crisis spurred
    financial markets to crash.The worldwide financial crisis in 2008 had a lot of
    consequences. Financial companies collapsed and some governments verged on bankruptcy.
    Large investment banks were bankrupt and the government started bailing out banks
    that they deemed too big to fail. Banks, of course, were most largely impacted,
    because ultimately that is where the crisis originated. These financial crises
    caused people to lose faith in existing financial systems. People used to feel
    that the bank was the safest option to keep their hard earn money, safe and secure.People
    started making mass withdrawals from banks. They had two options at that time.
    Either to keep all their money at home, which is not a great idea, or keep it
    in a bank, which they no longer trusted. There was a need for an alternate financial
    system. In addition, if you look over the current financial transaction, some
    of these take a couple of days to get transferred over the wire if two parties
    are in different countries. Another problem is the unfavorable exchange rates
    that lack transparency and thereby trust.

    of the words marked in bold in this definition is very important. We are going

    a digital currency so it doesn’t have a physical form. Unlike other digital cash,
    it has its own value and has corresponding denomination value for other currencies.There
    is a lot of discussion about Bitcoin being trustless and anonymous. This is not
    correct. In fact, trust is the main issue that led to the emergence of cryptocurrencies
    like Bitcoin. What Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have done is ensure that
    trust is moved from centralized to decentralized systems. Even Bitcoin is a FIAT
    currency  in nature, which means it is not backed by tangible value, but rather
    intangible value, i.e., trust. It has value just because a member of the group
    believes it has value and Bitcoin should be used to exchange in lieu of a good
    just like any currency. The only difference is a normal currency’s trust comes
    from government backing. Out here, it is from the people.Bitcoin, being decentralized,
    is very secure in nature. The Bitcoin system can’t be faked. The system can be
    trusted with full transparency. In fact, identities in Bitcoin are hidden and
    each identity is referenced through alphanumeric codes done using hash cryptography
    rather than names.The Blockchain is the underlying technology behind Bitcoin.
    Bitcoin is just an application created using Blockchain. Before delving more into
    Blockchain, it is important to understand the difference between centralized,
    decentralized, and distributed systems.

    which ensures all processes and decisions are carried out at this location. Centralized
    systems have a couple of advantages. As there is just one point of authority,
    the decision can be faster and easier to implement. Each point in the authority
    is responsible for one task. This prevents any single task from being done by
    multiple points, ensuring no duplicity and faster change management. Some of the
    examples of the centralized system include banks, Department of Motor Vehicles,
    credit agencies, title companies, and server CPUs, to name a few.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.png](A458845_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.png)Figure
    7-5A pictorial representation of a centralized system  , where one node governs
    the other nodesThe centralized system  introduces a lot of advantages and hence
    it’s been popular even now. However, centralized systems also have a lot of flaws.
    A single POA brings the notion of having a single point of failure. This means
    if this point goes down for any reason, the entire system will collapse. We witnessed
    such failure during the financial crisis of 2008\. Another flaw with these systems
    is that centralized system lacks transparency and is prone to fraud and distrust.
    Centralized systems works like a black box and people using centralized systems
    might get influenced with fraud and loss of trust. A centralized system has a
    lot advantages and are more suited for systems that can accept a single point
    of trust, require fast growth, and of course, don’t require growing systems at
    scale.

  zh: 中央集权系统，如[图7-5](#Fig5)所示，是具有单一权威点（POA）的系统。所有控制都集中在这个权威点，这确保了所有流程和决策都在此地执行。中央集权系统有几个优点。由于只有一个权威点，决策可以更快、更容易地实施。权威点中的每一个都负责一个任务。这可以防止任何单一任务被多个点执行，确保没有重复性，使变更管理更快。一些中央集权系统的例子包括银行、机动车管理部门、信用机构、产权公司和服务器
    CPU，等等。![A458845_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.png](A458845_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.png)图7-5中央集权系统的图示表示，一个节点控制其他节点中央集权系统引入了许多优点，因此即使在现在仍然很受欢迎。但是，中央集权系统也有很多缺点。单一POA带来了单一故障点的概念。这意味着如果由于任何原因这个点宕机，整个系统将崩溃。我们在2008年的金融危机期间目睹了这种失败。这些系统的另一个缺点是，中央集权系统缺乏透明度，容易受到欺诈和不信任的影响。中央集权系统像一个黑匣子一样运作，使用中央集权系统的人可能会受到欺诈和信任损失的影响。中央集权系统有很多优点，更适合能够接受单一信任点、需要快速增长，当然，不需要在规模上增长的系统。

    authority tasks are more diversified. Unlike centralized systems, decentralized
    systems also ensure a flat hierarchy. You can think of decentralized systems as
    containing lots of nodes, with few nodes having additional tasks to authority
    and instead broadcasting that authority to several other nodes.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig6_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig6_HTML.jpg)Figure

    doing this at one central location. Some of the classic examples of decentralized
    systems include a Cloud database and state authorities, to name a few. One of
    the disadvantages of the decentralized system is that, since there is multiple
    points of authority, chances of a duplicate task is higher, which can affect economies
    of scale. A decentralized system is more secure than a centralized one, but is
    still not 100% secure.

    Each node has equal power. This is the most secure among the three systems. This
    doesn’t mean the system can’t be hacked or faked, but to do it, you must have
    more than 50 percent control over the points of authority. The time needed to
    fake and hack would nullify any benefits and hence distributed systems are considered

    7-7A pictorial representation of distributed systems  , where all nodes have equal
    powerThe distributed system ensures a flat hierarchy, which ensures everyone is
    equal. There are a lot of advantages to having distributed systems. Since all
    the nodes are equal, it removes the need for an intermediary. Changes are replicated
    across all nodes and verified by at least 50 percent of the nodes, making it very
    transparent. Distributed systems make perfect options for a system requiring third-party
    trust, intermediary, or even trusting another node. While using the distributed
    system, you don’t need to trust anyone but the system itself. Some of the examples
    of distributed systems include cryptocurrency and of course, Blockchain.With decentralization
    and disintermediation at the core of the Bitcoin system and Blockchain, there
    is no requirement for people to trust each other, just the system. Distributed
    systems  , however, take some time to set up and require a good initial amount
    of investment. Among all the three systems, distributed systems are the most stable.
    Another benefit of using distributed systems is that they are infinitely scalable
    and hence any process involving scalability issues at large scale can safely vouch
    for using distributed systems.

    of BlockchainTo understand the power of Blockchain, let’s look at it from another
    angle. Trust is inevitable and part of our daily life. Everything that we do involves
    some sense of trust associated with it. Whether you are buying a car or house,
    doing any financial transactions, viewing a website, buying products online or
    from the market, or even getting a degree from a university, the ledger in one
    form or another is the fundamental source of trust. Take the case of financial
    transactions. Hundreds of trillions of transactions happen every year across the
    globe. Historically, we maintain ledgers, shown in Figure [7-9](#Fig9), to handle
    and store information about the transaction.![A458845_1_En_7_Fig9_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig9_HTML.jpg)Figure
    7-9A classic ledgerThese ledgers have been either kept in lockers for safety or
    have been given to the third parties such as banks, universities, or another third-party
    trusted source. In the last few decades, we saw some of these ledgers moved to
    the centralized database. One of the benefits of using these ledgers is that they
    are easily accessible whenever required. For example, if you want to get a copy
    of a transaction statement that’s 10 years old, it’s just a matter of clicking
    your banking site. Similarly, you can always get a copy of your degree from a
    university in case you lost it, because universities safely store your records.
    This benefit of making it available also makes it vulnerable to errors, making
    it fake, or even modifying it with ease. We have already discussed issues related
    to centralized systems.

    Contracts, computers can take an action if some requirements get fulfilled. In
    raw terms, Smart Contracts are a suite of various if-else statements. Take a betting
    scenario case. If Real Madrid wins the La Liga, Nishith gets the money; otherwise,
    he pays.In most cases, you might not trust the other party during the betting.
    In these scenarios, self-executing contracts bring a lot of trust on the table.
    Smart Contracts also bring options to revise, execute, or even propose contracts,
    thereby ensuring the highest level of traceability and trust. Take a use case
    of insurance claims. Currently, all insurance companies use the manual process
    of paperwork, complex execution, administration costs, etc. It would indeed be
    beneficial to execute these claims using Smart Contracts to ensure a hassle-free
    claiming process, less administration cost, and the highest level of transparency.
    Take another case of payment where you pay to the contractors only when they fulfills
    your requirement. Smart Contracts  and Blockchain can be used to remove a lot
    of inefficiencies that exist in the contracts management process.

  zh: 智能合约是自执行的合约。它们也被称为数字合约。智能合约并不是一个新概念。事实上，二十年前，计算机科学家尼克·萨波在设计和实现基于去中心化的系统时提出并强调了智能合约的必要性。智能合约可以被视为帮助在数字化执行合约的计算机程序。与任何其他合约不同，智能合约不仅仅定义了协议和协议周围的后果，而且强制执行它们。通过使用智能合约，计算机可以在某些要求得到满足时采取行动。用简单的术语来说，智能合约是各种
    if-else 语句的集合。以一个押注场景为例。如果皇家马德里赢得了西甲联赛，尼希斯将得到钱；否则，他将付出代价。在大多数情况下，您可能不信任押注的另一方。在这些情况下，自执行合约为押注方带来了很多信任。智能合约还带来了修订、执行或甚至提出合约的选择，从而确保最高级别的可追溯性和信任。以保险索赔为例。目前，所有保险公司都使用繁琐的纸张工作、复杂的执行、行政成本等手动流程。使用智能合约执行这些索赔确实会有利于确保无忧索赔流程、降低行政成本并确保最高级别的透明度。再举一个支付案例，您只有在承包商满足您的要求时才支付给他们。智能合约和区块链可以用来消除合同管理流程中存在的许多低效。

    through Bitcoin. One of the bloggers named Vitalik Buterin found few limitations
    of Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn’t allow you to create your own smart contract or even
    your own currency. Earlier in this chapter, we discussed how important and impactful
    the smart contract can be. Vitalik reached out to the Bitcoin team with a few
    recommendations, such as the ability of Bitcoin to build its own currency or smart
    contract without requiring the need to build the entire Blockchain. Moreover,
    Vitalik insisted on the need for a scripting language on top of the Bitcoin system
    so it can be used for application development and more broader uses. Since Bitcoin
    implementation of Blockchain is more public and based on the shared distributed
    ledger, it was not possible for the Bitcoin team to implement this suggestion
    and they refused. Vitalik wrote a whitepaper explaining Ethereum and got a lot
    of funding, through which he built Ethereum, as shown in Figure [7-15](#Fig15).![A458845_1_En_7_Fig15_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig15_HTML.jpg)Figure
    7-15The Ethereum coinEthereum  is a shared computing platform that enables people
    to build smart contracts and cryptocurrencies without having people to build their
    own Blockchain. On top of that, it has its own Turing complete programming language
    that allows developers to create custom applications. Ethereum is a game changer
    in Blockchain implementation, as it allows everyone to adopt the Blockchain technology.

  zh: 2013年，各种博主和区块链爱好者通过比特币探讨了使用案例。其中一位名叫维塔利克·布特林（Vitalik Buterin）的博主发现了比特币的一些局限性。比特币不允许你创建自己的智能合约，甚至自己的货币。在本章前面，我们讨论了智能合约的重要性和影响力。维塔利克向比特币团队提出了一些建议，比如让比特币能够建立自己的货币或智能合约，而无需建立整个区块链。此外，维塔利克坚持认为比特币系统需要一个脚本语言，以便用于应用程序开发和更广泛的用途。由于比特币实现的区块链更具公开性，基于共享分布式账本，因此比特币团队无法实现这一建议，并拒绝了。维塔利克撰写了一份解释以太坊的白皮书，并获得了大量资金，通过这些资金他建立了以太坊，如图[7-15](#Fig15)所示。![A458845_1_En_7_Fig15_HTML.jpg](A458845_1_En_7_Fig15_HTML.jpg)图7-15
    以太币以太坊是一个共享计算平台，使人们能够构建智能合约和加密货币，而无需人们建立自己的区块链。此外，它还有自己的图灵完备编程语言，允许开发人员创建定制应用程序。以太坊在区块链实施方面是一个改变游戏规则的技术，因为它使每个人都能够采用区块链技术。

    disintermediate way to store cryptocurrency. The initial success of cryptocurrency
    and its usage pushed across industry verticals to ensure and utilize Blockchain
    in an effective manner. This has led to different flavors of the original Blockchain
    implementation. At a high level, various implementations of Blockchain across
    industries can be placed into three different models, having differences in access
    control and network type. This means each model is different in terms of who can
    be part of the Blockchain network (public, on demand, etc..), who can execute

    from the public can join the network, write the data under the consensus protocol,
    and read it. The advantage of this Blockchain type lies in being fully decentralized,
    transparent, and anonymous. These types of public Blockchains are applicable across
    various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin, etc.'

- en: 'Private Blockchain : Also known as internal Blockchain, this type of Blockchain
    implementation is designed for private networks and governed by one organization.
    This organization is responsible for setting up the rules to join the network
    and read data. Some of the trusted nodes get the higher privilege of providing
    acceptance of the transaction. Such types of Blockchain implementation are less
    expensive, faster, confidential, and only allow authenticated parties to participate
    in the network. Some of the examples are the Kadena chain, Iroha, and Blockchain
