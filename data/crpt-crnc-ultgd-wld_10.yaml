    hear many positive things about it. At the same time, you might hear many raise
    questions and doubts about its legitimacy. Like all other currencies, many good
    things can be said about it, but it is not all that glitter are gold either. There
    are many valid and legitimate claims that present genuine risks as well.

    are digital and encrypted; you cannot be ripped off in a transaction as you can
    be with legacy payment systems, and it is much harder to steal cryptocurrency
    compared to a full wallet cash. In a world where so many of our transactions are

- en: 'You Control Your Money: Void of any middleman or third-party interests, no
    one is in charge of your money. There is no other electronic cash system in which
    your account isn’t owned by someone else. Take PayPal, for example: if the company
    decides for some reason that your account has been misused, it has the power to
    freeze all of the assets held in the account, without consulting you. It is then
    up to you to jump through whatever hoops are necessary to get it cleared so that
    you can access your funds. With cryptocurrency, you own the private key and the
    corresponding public key that makes up your cryptocurrency address. No one can
    take that away from you (unless you lose it yourself, or host it with a web-based
    wallet service that loses it for you).'

- en: 'Lack of Acceptance: One of the biggest negatives with cryptocurrencies is their
    newness. While users can do a lot of things with them; buy, sell, trade, or purchase
    but it is not like the whole world would accepts them like they do VISA or American
    Express. Finding vendors that are willing to accept crypto for the payment of
    goods and services is not always easy. Until it is, users will have to exchange
    their currency for local currency to make most purchases.'

  zh: 缺乏接受度：加密货币最大的负面因素就是它们的新颖性。虽然用户可以用它们做很多事情——购买、销售、交易或购买，但不像整个世界都接受VISA或美国运通卡一样接受它们。找到愿意接受加密货币作为商品和服务支付的商家并不总是那么容易。在它普及之前，用户将不得不将他们的货币兑换成当地货币以进行大多数购买。
- en: 'Volatile: While Bitcoin is a pretty stable currency, most other cryptocurrencies
    are not. When you are ready to invest, it is important to remember that it should
    be treated more like a commodity. Prices can fluctuate wildly depending on the

    of this book. Cryptocurrencies cannot be recovered if they are lost. Unlike financial
