    cryptocurrency, smart contracts, distributed ledger-based DAPPs, ICOs, and tokens.
    We’ve also explored how crypto exchanges support direct trading between major
    cryptocurrencies and fiat money, as well as trading among and between different
    cryptocurrencies. And we’ve reviewed how ICOs have established themselves as a
    powerful new way of raising capital in crypto world.

    so ever since traditional VC came onto the ICO evaluation scene. Many quality
    ICOs have been received well in the prime market. However, these same ICOs often

- en: Liquidity reveals how strong a project is in terms of potential cash-out. In
    a market where there are fewer buyers than sellers, sellers will lower their trading
    price to attract buyers. In the crypto world, this decreases the value of tokens.

- en: The reason behind this mainly arises from people trying to make quick money
    in the secondary market. When ICOs reach the secondary market, the prices are
    much higher than they were in the prime market. Accordingly, shareholders of an
    ICO often try to cash out before the prices go down in the secondary market. However,
    prime market investors making fast money and cashing out leaves a mess for the
    individual investors in the secondary market who have purchased the tokens at
    the peak of their price. An ICO is like a stock that needs constant buying and
    selling to maintain its liquidity and value. When early investors in the ICO cash
    out their shares, it makes it very challenging to maintain stability.

  zh: 这主要是因为人们在二级市场上试图快速赚钱。当ICO达到二级市场时，其价格要比在初级市场时高得多。因此，ICO的股东们常常试图在二级市场价格下跌之前套现。然而，初级市场投资者的快钱和套现留下了烂摊子给在价格高峰购买代币的二级市场个人投资者。ICO就像需要不断买卖以维持其流动性和价值的股票。当ICO的早期投资者套现他们的股份时，维持稳定变得非常具有挑战性。
- en: When a blockchain startup launches an ICO, it’s usually still in its early stages.
    Once it is listed in the market, the startup may find it is not able to keep up
    with innovations it promised to deliver on paper. What then makes such a situation
    even worse is when the shareholders try to cash out, which in turn drives the
    anxiety level of the whole market up. True, some strong projects do continuously
    improve their service and technology and see their quarterly net profits reliably
    increasing. However, we cannot assume that this will always, or even typically,
    be the case.

- en: The design of the early token economy is certainly not perfect. In a traditional
    financial market, before a company launches an IPO, the CEO and management team
    design a thoughtful plan detailing how shares will be offered, and price of shares,
    in a way that ensures the liquidity of the stock after the IPO is launched. But
    many blockchain projects launch an ICO without sufficient experience (or any experience).
    This lack of experience usually reveals itself when the secondary market comes
    in to play. Currently, there are just not enough competent financial teams available
    to help startups to properly analyze all pertinent aspects of their offerings.
    As a consequence, many companies overoffer shares to investors when conducting
    the ICO launch. For example, many only reserve 10 percent of issued tokens, meaning
    90 percent of tokens will go flooding into the market, which makes it possible
    for speculators to manipulate the prices. Once a bad actor controls over 50 pecent
    of the tokens of one ICO, the team on the project will have no control over the
    tokens or the prices of the tokens in the secondary market. This kind of situation
    happened a lot in the early days of the cryptocurrency market. Many investors
    took advantage of insider information to make a quick buck off of people in the
    secondary market. While the overall situation has improved, the lack of strong
    regulation still hurts liquidity in the secondary market (as well as some investors
    in the prime market). Yet, so far, the majority of ICOs are still using the utility
    token format. They are not traded in markets where security regulations are fully
    developed. The role the SEC is playing—or hints that it may play—is increasingly
    critical. Total transparency would greatly increase market liquidity. As it stands,
    the violent up and down of token values in the secondary market remains a major
    issue. (Just look at the market prices at which Bitcoins are valued in different
    countries.)

  zh: 早期代币经济的设计显然并不完美。在传统金融市场中，一家公司在进行IPO之前，CEO和管理团队会设计一个深思熟虑的计划，详细说明如何发行股票以及股票的价格，以确保IPO启动后股票的流动性。但是，许多区块链项目在缺乏经验（或者根本没有经验）的情况下就启动了ICO。这种缺乏经验通常在二级市场介入时显现出来。目前，可供帮助初创公司分析其产品所有相关方面的合格金融团队实在太少。因此，许多公司在进行ICO启动时过度向投资者配股。例如，许多项目只预留了发行代币的10%，这意味着90%的代币将涌入市场，这使得投机者有可能操纵价格。一旦一个不良分子控制了一个ICO超过50%的代币，该项目的团队在二级市场上就无法控制代币或代币的价格。这种情况在加密货币市场的早期阶段经常发生。许多投资者利用内部信息在二级市场上快速赚取利润。虽然整体情况有所改善，但缺乏强有力的监管仍然伤害了二级市场的流动性（以及一些初级市场的投资者）。然而，到目前为止，大多数ICO仍在使用功能代币格式。它们不在那些证券法规完全发达的市场中交易。SEC所扮演的角色——或者它可能扮演的角色——越来越关键。完全透明将极大地提高市场流动性。现状是，二级市场上代币价值的剧烈波动仍然是主要问题。（只需看看不同国家比特币的市场价格。）
- en: According to crypto expert Vincent Molinari, many ICO offers are still no more
    than schemes—a way for a few people to cash in. Yet he believes when regulation
    is in place, the market value will return to a reasonable level, these schemes
    will go away, and all good actors will benefit over time. Long-term investment
    will become the rule and not the exception. Consider that in the prime market
    of an ICO, it usually takes six months to a year to turn capital into profits.
    Whereas, in traditional VC, as I noted earlier, it usually takes ten years.

    sophisticated individual traders以及比特币矿工。

    secondary market, but for the whole crypto industry in the days ahead.
