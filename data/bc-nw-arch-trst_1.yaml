    of trust in government, business, and the media. Its yearly report, released at
    the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, offers a detailed snapshot of
    societal trust patterns. The picture is not encouraging. Most of the trust indexes
    have been on a downward trend for some time. Recently, the erosion of trust has
    accelerated. The 2017 Edelman Trust Barometer report was entitled *An Implosion
    of Trust*.^([5](#chapter1-5)) Only 15 percent of the general population believes
    “the system” is working. The “profound crisis of trust” revealed in the survey
    is both deep and wide. It extends across all categories of institutions—including

    America, epitomized by the decline in bowling leagues relative to individual bowling.^([9](#chapter1-9))

    pathologies. Five years earlier, Fukuyama similarly had sounded the alarm about
    a crisis of trust globally, and particularly in contemporary America.^([10](#chapter1-10))

    car rental firms refuse anyone under twenty five—but parents generally have enough
    faith to accept the vulnerability. The externalities of the trust relationship

    of something the trustor cares about, where such ‘caring for’ involves some exercise
    of discretionary powers.”^([46](#chapter1-46)) And that discretion implies that
    the trustee may turn out to be untrustworthy, despite efforts at verification.

    networks is proof of stake (POS). Instead of mining, holders of a POS cryptocurrency
    compete to validate transactions by staking some of their holdings. If the majority
    of the network rejects their block, the staked currency is “slashed” and destroyed.
    If the block validation succeeds, the validator earns a reward. POS mimics the
    cost/benefit trade-off of mining, without all the processing. Instead of proving
    their commitment by dedicating expensive computing power, those who wish to validate
    blocks put resources at risk of slashing. POS thus relies on game-theoretic incentives

    not simply record information passed to them. They are part of a consensus system,

    financial transfers.^([33](#chapter3-33)) I cannot initiate a transaction promising

    the transfer is part of the process. This is the smart-contract functionality.
    Both the specification of rights and obligations and the execution of that contractual
    agreement occur through the platform. That is very different from traditional
    financial transactions, where clearing and settlement are distinct processes from

    Cars are often used as collateral for loans. If a dealer sells a car but does
    not notify the bank issuing it a loan, and then the dealer goes bankrupt, the
    bank has no way to recover the funds. Unscrupulous car dealers in Russia would
    sell tens of millions of dollars of inventory that they were simultaneously using
    as collateral for bank loans. Similar issues occur with uncertified parts. Even
    when licensed dealers attempt to use only authorized parts when repairing cars,
    they have no control over other points in the supply chain where counterfeit parts
    may enter.

    manufacturing to sale to aftermarket repair. Manufacturers, financial services
    firms, and intermediaries in the automotive industry could come together to create
    a unified view of the supply chain and financial chain around a car. In the blockchain
    model, says Pon, “there is one shared immutable truth, which everyone sees immediately.
    If there is a change, it is propagated immediately.”^([37](#chapter4-37)) This
    would allow additional services, such as insurance and predictive pricing algorithms,
    to be applied on top of the common data set. The blockchain itself would not guarantee
    the accuracy of the information recorded, nor would it force all the companies
    to participate. However, by creating a common platform, it would make it easier
    to address those challenges. Toyota joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance to
    help develop such an industrywide platform.

    faxes were sent just to manage syndicated loans.^([43](#chapter4-43)) Major investment
    banks literally employ hundreds of people (typically offshore, in lower-wage countries

    company connected to the blockchain. OpenBazaar, a well-known, cryptocurrency-powered
    decentralized marketplace, even felt obliged to issue a blog post explaining why
    it was not doing an ICO.^([54](#chapter4-54)) Among the reasons given were the
    economic and legal uncertainty of the concept and the absence of any need for
    a token in the company’s business model. Six months later, its CEO announced plans
    for an OpenBazaar Token at the Token Summit conference.^([55](#chapter4-55))

    a limited inventory of investments available to the public, and great uncertainty
    about the future, it is easy for the market price of a token—what someone will
    pay for it—to become detached from any rational assessment of its real worth—the
    discounted value of future activity on the network. Such gaps are endemic to financial
    markets. Market-makers and arbitrageurs use breaks between trading and real values
    as money-making opportunities, and in so doing move markets toward the “correct”
    price, a process known as “price discovery.” That is how things work in theory.
    In practice, though, there are many opportunities for abuses that harm investors,
    giving rise to a large body of financial regulation. The legal and regulatory
    status of token sales will be discussed in chapter 9.

    benefits that Facebook generates as a result. If Facebook were organized around
    an appcoin, users could share the benefits as token prices appreciated—at least
    in theory. The potential value of a token could also provide incentives for users
    to engage with what could become the next Facebook. Early adopters and strong
    believers in new platforms would be encouraged to get in early, when the token
    price was low. In contrast to traditional venture capital funding, which does
    not provide a “liquidity event” until the company is sold or goes public, the

- en: At this early stage of development of the cryptocurrency market, few platforms
    other than Bitcoin itself are operating on a sufficient scale to drive the value
    of their tokens based on actual utility. Most of the ICOs launched so far are
    for services that are not yet operational. Some will never succeed in launching
    a production network. Even the ones that reach that point may not attract a substantial
    number of users. Just because something *can* be tokenized does not mean that
    it *should* be. Where the model makes sense, however, it has the potential to
    change the way that start-ups are funded and grow.

- en: 'A tokenized business is actually two economic systems linked together: an internal
    cryptoasset marketplace tied to an external cryptoeconomic security system (the
    blockchain network). Most Dapps outsource the cryptoeconomic verification by operating
    on top of an infrastructure platform such as Ethereum. That still leaves significant
    challenges. In OpenBazaar’s case, the biggest reason for forgoing an ICO was that
    it does not need an internal token to motivate behavior. As an eBay-like marketplace,
    it already has an economy: exchanging goods for money.'

    Before ICOs, the primary example of services powered by user-owned private currencies
    were online games that offered virtual coins to purchase goods or gain abilities.^([60](#chapter4-60))
    The virtual goods model powered the rapid growth of gaming companies such as Zynga
    and Supercell. But it also created problems, such as overreliance on high-spending
    “whales” and vulnerability to fickle user tastes, as shown when Zynga’s usage
    (and subsequently the stock price) collapsed. Operating a company in thrall to
    a market price that you do not control is not a simple matter. Token issuers typically
    have some power to adjust the exchange rate of tokens for services on the platform,
    but if they go too far in devaluing the tokens, users will revolt.

    by extracting value from its network. Its business model is incompatible with
    a fully tokenized structure, in which value resides in the network. This creates
    opportunities for competitors built around token economies. However, those competitors
    face the same trade-offs. And while Facebook would have to change its business
