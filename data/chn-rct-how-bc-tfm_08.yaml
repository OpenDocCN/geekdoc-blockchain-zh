    explored: while there are plenty of instances of problems faced by developing
    countries where blockchain might help (and others where it certainly won’t), the
    most frequent sticking point is government. How will governments respond to electronic
    payment systems that could dent the national sovereignty of the currency , undermine
    control over monetary policy or, at the very least, prevent some ruling party
    cronies creaming kickbacks? How will political leaders take to disruption by a

    developing country households. Even if the purchaser has little formal credit
    history, in the Big Bet scenario their use of digital money and their blockchain-based
    single national identity form the basis for a bank to make an informed lending
    decision. Having secured a loan, the purchaser continues to build a credit history.
    Because the purchase has been formalized and is linked to the buyer’s digital
    identity , it is straightforward for the government to charge VAT on the purchase,
    expanding the tax base. The introduction of these digital channels also reduces
    barriers to the bank serving customers like our borrower, expanding the bank’s
    revenue and margins. This leads to the bank making both more loans, thereby supporting
    economic growth, and more profit, thereby increasing the tax paid by the bank.
    The title of the motorcycle is held electronically on a blockchain-based property
    register . Eventually, when the owner is ready to sell the motorcycle and buy

    the risk of theft and support transactions. From Central Asia to Central Africa,
    major purchases are frequently made with huge stacks of low denomination bank
    notes. The process often involves having to travel many hours to a bank to obtain
    the notes in the first place. In Malawi , for example, the largest denomination
    note is worth US$2.75, so even the purchase of a used motorcycle might require
    a stack of more than 150 notes. In some of Malawi’s more economically successful
    communities, such as fishing villages on the islands in Lake Malawi , a prospective
    purchaser would need to travel five hours each way on a weekly, frequently delayed
    colonial-era ferry to withdraw the money to purchase the motorbike. The complexity
    of getting cash complicates and sometimes prevents transactions from taking place.
    Cryptocurrencies and other digital money solutions are clearly an appealing alternative,
