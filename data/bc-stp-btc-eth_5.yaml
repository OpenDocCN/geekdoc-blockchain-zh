- en: 'CHAPTER 5Wallet DesignIn previous chapters, we discussed the removal of friction
    in handling money; one way to make crypto-assets easier to use is better wallet
    applications. Wallets are an entrepreneurial opportunity because the sellers can
    choose from proven business models: you a) support the trade of assets by connecting
    to an exchange, b) charge for the hardware of the wallet, or c) support secure
    backup for a monthly fee. Some wallet startups are experimenting with new business
    models, but it is too soon to tell if they will work. That is why this chapter
    is just about ease of use and security, with the assumption that if you build
    a safe and easy wallet, the paying users will come.Better user experience helps
    to bring crypto-assets to a larger group of adopters. The interface to crypto-assets,
    a “wallet,” lets you send, receive, and hold crypto-assets. However, at this point,
    only tech-savvy people, the “innovators,” use them with confidence. Even the best
    wallets are, at times, awkward to use. In the coming years, wallet developers
    have to tinker until grandma can give her grandchild a CryptoKitty for their birthday.I
    have mentioned the point at which I felt I could buy Bitcoin with confidence.
    I had attempted to buy Bitcoin much earlier but gave up because of the friction
    and risks. The wallet technology and the market penetration of exchanges had to
    reach a certain level of ease before I became a buyer. My case is one example
    among many. No matter your technical expertise, motivation, and talent, at some
    point buying and owning Bitcoin was over your head. It is not just about your
    access to a market; you also have to be capable of securing the asset. This also
    applies to the Bitcoiners who could get in very early by mining on a laptop. I
    have heard and read many accounts of screwups and theft. The following situations
    are typical:•    Some early Bitcoiners mined many coins but did not keep a backup.
    Corrupted hard drives or partners throwing out “old computers” have cost them
    dearly.•    Some people secured their crypto-assets with overly complicated methods,
    forgot a critical step, and could not recover their property.•    Some kept their
    security setup simple but forgot their password after an accident that involved
    a blow to the head, or forgot over time.•    After Bitcoin became more mainstream,
    thieves started targeting known holders with hacking, break-ins, or kidnapping
    combined with threats of violence.•    Hackers use phishing attacks, trojan horses,
    and infected websites to enter wallets on people’s personal computers. I witnessed
    one such case up close. The victim had $30,000 worth of crypto-assets on a laptop
    dedicated to this purpose, stored in multiple wallet applications. He had installed
    a Monero wallet that turned out to be malicious. After getting access to the computer,
    the attacker drained it and all his other wallets as well. The victim had a professional
    background in information technology, but there was nothing he could do to stop
    the theft after he downloaded that compromised wallet.Tragic events such as these
    are symptoms of the innovator stage of crypto-assets. We can look to a future
    where such problems are as rare as errors in a bank statement. In recent years,
    wallet designers have already addressed several of these security issues—we will
    cover this below.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets, we can compare
    types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each payment method
    has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle each of them as
    challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user to undertake a
    series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their goal. We distinguish
    these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For example, in some countries
    and for some people, applying for a credit card has a two-month lead time and
    represents a five-hour workload. In other countries, you get a functional credit
    card in the mail without even asking for it, provided that you have a good credit
    score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard, but credit cards are far
    from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter. This example shows that
    technology can have friction at different levels and points of contact, depending
    on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users and use empathy to find
    the points of friction for their target market.In the long term, we can expect
    each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a single wallet technology
    that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be built by new companies or
    open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet application will hold fiat
    currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat currency requires a banking
    license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets. That is why the fiat
    currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’ fiat currency, usually
    dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves some of the problems
    of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter 3\. A complete wallet
    will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets, and remove friction
    in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could develop similarly to
    the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and effortless utility.
    The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting telephone and
    publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The first step to
    mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent waves
    of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.
    Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions,
    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security
    experts have to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break
    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with
    a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.Wallet DesignIn previous chapters, we
    discussed the removal of friction in handling money; one way to make crypto-assets
    easier to use is better wallet applications. Wallets are an entrepreneurial opportunity
    because the sellers can choose from proven business models: you a) support the
    trade of assets by connecting to an exchange, b) charge for the hardware of the
    wallet, or c) support secure backup for a monthly fee. Some wallet startups are
    experimenting with new business models, but it is too soon to tell if they will
    work. That is why this chapter is just about ease of use and security, with the
    assumption that if you build a safe and easy wallet, the paying users will come.Better
    user experience helps to bring crypto-assets to a larger group of adopters. The

    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.In previous chapters, we discussed the
    removal of friction in handling money; one way to make crypto-assets easier to
    use is better wallet applications. Wallets are an entrepreneurial opportunity
    because the sellers can choose from proven business models: you a) support the
    trade of assets by connecting to an exchange, b) charge for the hardware of the
    wallet, or c) support secure backup for a monthly fee. Some wallet startups are
    experimenting with new business models, but it is too soon to tell if they will
    work. That is why this chapter is just about ease of use and security, with the
    assumption that if you build a safe and easy wallet, the paying users will come.Better
    user experience helps to bring crypto-assets to a larger group of adopters. The
    interface to crypto-assets, a “wallet,” lets you send, receive, and hold crypto-assets.
    However, at this point, only tech-savvy people, the “innovators,” use them with
    confidence. Even the best wallets are, at times, awkward to use. In the coming
    years, wallet developers have to tinker until grandma can give her grandchild
    a CryptoKitty for their birthday.I have mentioned the point at which I felt I
    could buy Bitcoin with confidence. I had attempted to buy Bitcoin much earlier
    but gave up because of the friction and risks. The wallet technology and the market
    penetration of exchanges had to reach a certain level of ease before I became
    a buyer. My case is one example among many. No matter your technical expertise,
    motivation, and talent, at some point buying and owning Bitcoin was over your
    head. It is not just about your access to a market; you also have to be capable
    of securing the asset. This also applies to the Bitcoiners who could get in very
    early by mining on a laptop. I have heard and read many accounts of screwups and
    theft. The following situations are typical:•    Some early Bitcoiners mined many
    coins but did not keep a backup. Corrupted hard drives or partners throwing out
    “old computers” have cost them dearly.•    Some people secured their crypto-assets
    with overly complicated methods, forgot a critical step, and could not recover
    their property.•    Some kept their security setup simple but forgot their password
    after an accident that involved a blow to the head, or forgot over time.•    After
    Bitcoin became more mainstream, thieves started targeting known holders with hacking,
    break-ins, or kidnapping combined with threats of violence.•    Hackers use phishing
    attacks, trojan horses, and infected websites to enter wallets on people’s personal
    computers. I witnessed one such case up close. The victim had $30,000 worth of
    crypto-assets on a laptop dedicated to this purpose, stored in multiple wallet
    applications. He had installed a Monero wallet that turned out to be malicious.
    After getting access to the computer, the attacker drained it and all his other
    wallets as well. The victim had a professional background in information technology,
    but there was nothing he could do to stop the theft after he downloaded that compromised
    wallet.Tragic events such as these are symptoms of the innovator stage of crypto-assets.
    We can look to a future where such problems are as rare as errors in a bank statement.
    In recent years, wallet designers have already addressed several of these security
    issues—we will cover this below.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets,
    we can compare types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each
    payment method has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle
    each of them as challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user
    to undertake a series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their
    goal. We distinguish these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For
    example, in some countries and for some people, applying for a credit card has
    a two-month lead time and represents a five-hour workload. In other countries,
    you get a functional credit card in the mail without even asking for it, provided
    that you have a good credit score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard,
    but credit cards are far from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter.
    This example shows that technology can have friction at different levels and points
    of contact, depending on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users
    and use empathy to find the points of friction for their target market.In the
    long term, we can expect each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a
    single wallet technology that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be
    built by new companies or open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet
    application will hold fiat currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat
    currency requires a banking license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets.
    That is why the fiat currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’
    fiat currency, usually dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves
    some of the problems of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter
    3\. A complete wallet will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets,
    and remove friction in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could
    develop similarly to the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and
    effortless utility. The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting
    telephone and publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The
    first step to mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent
    waves of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.
    Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions,
    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security
    experts have to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break
    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with
    a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is

    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The

    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.Better user experience helps to bring
    crypto-assets to a larger group of adopters. The interface to crypto-assets, a
    “wallet,” lets you send, receive, and hold crypto-assets. However, at this point,
    only tech-savvy people, the “innovators,” use them with confidence. Even the best
    wallets are, at times, awkward to use. In the coming years, wallet developers
    have to tinker until grandma can give her grandchild a CryptoKitty for their birthday.I
    have mentioned the point at which I felt I could buy Bitcoin with confidence.
    I had attempted to buy Bitcoin much earlier but gave up because of the friction
    and risks. The wallet technology and the market penetration of exchanges had to
    reach a certain level of ease before I became a buyer. My case is one example
    among many. No matter your technical expertise, motivation, and talent, at some
    point buying and owning Bitcoin was over your head. It is not just about your
    access to a market; you also have to be capable of securing the asset. This also
    applies to the Bitcoiners who could get in very early by mining on a laptop. I
    have heard and read many accounts of screwups and theft. The following situations
    are typical:•    Some early Bitcoiners mined many coins but did not keep a backup.
    Corrupted hard drives or partners throwing out “old computers” have cost them
    dearly.•    Some people secured their crypto-assets with overly complicated methods,
    forgot a critical step, and could not recover their property.•    Some kept their
    security setup simple but forgot their password after an accident that involved
    a blow to the head, or forgot over time.•    After Bitcoin became more mainstream,
    thieves started targeting known holders with hacking, break-ins, or kidnapping
    combined with threats of violence.•    Hackers use phishing attacks, trojan horses,
    and infected websites to enter wallets on people’s personal computers. I witnessed
    one such case up close. The victim had $30,000 worth of crypto-assets on a laptop
    dedicated to this purpose, stored in multiple wallet applications. He had installed
    a Monero wallet that turned out to be malicious. After getting access to the computer,
    the attacker drained it and all his other wallets as well. The victim had a professional
    background in information technology, but there was nothing he could do to stop
    the theft after he downloaded that compromised wallet.Tragic events such as these
    are symptoms of the innovator stage of crypto-assets. We can look to a future
    where such problems are as rare as errors in a bank statement. In recent years,
    wallet designers have already addressed several of these security issues—we will
    cover this below.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets, we can compare
    types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each payment method
    has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle each of them as
    challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user to undertake a
    series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their goal. We distinguish
    these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For example, in some countries
    and for some people, applying for a credit card has a two-month lead time and
    represents a five-hour workload. In other countries, you get a functional credit
    card in the mail without even asking for it, provided that you have a good credit
    score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard, but credit cards are far
    from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter. This example shows that
    technology can have friction at different levels and points of contact, depending
    on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users and use empathy to find
    the points of friction for their target market.In the long term, we can expect
    each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a single wallet technology
    that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be built by new companies or
    open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet application will hold fiat
    currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat currency requires a banking
    license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets. That is why the fiat
    currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’ fiat currency, usually
    dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves some of the problems
    of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter 3\. A complete wallet
    will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets, and remove friction
    in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could develop similarly to
    the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and effortless utility.
    The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting telephone and
    publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The first step to
    mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent waves
    of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.
    Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions,
    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security
    experts have to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break
    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with
    a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.

    felt I could buy Bitcoin with confidence. I had attempted to buy Bitcoin much
    earlier but gave up because of the friction and risks. The wallet technology and
    the market penetration of exchanges had to reach a certain level of ease before

    use phishing attacks, trojan horses, and infected websites to enter wallets on

    or damage the hardware device. Although keys are information, the risk is physical
    because a criminal could coerce the owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets.
    This security tradeoff is the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets
    should be easy to use, but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk.
    You can boost security by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in
    terms of money or hassle.The dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble
    a substance that is also liquid and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle
    this oily explosive with care because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned
    to stabilize nitroglycerine with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting
    tunnels through mountains or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still
    a dangerous substance. Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover
    the ‘absorbents’ of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users
    from theft and loss.Part of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found
    in history and nature. Before liquid assets could be information, they were always
    physical objects, such as jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets
    you must either hide or defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could
    target you for robbery. Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters
    choose to act without the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to
    most people who prefer to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership,
    such as assets in a bank. Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary
    people protect their wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal
    system. This is the primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat
    can nature tell us about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that
    save food for the future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become
    smart enough or strong enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ
    an army of kamikaze pilots. They answer force with force. There are also other
    approaches used by non-violent animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does
    cache spacing : hiding food in separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible
    portfolio manager. A competitor could discover one cache, but the other caches
    stay hidden. Squirrels and other rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the
    exact location of about 1200 nuts and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity”
    measures, civilians could hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden
    or protected backups are already part of the current best wallet designs.Design
    TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets is, in some ways, easier than owning material things.
    You can transport your wealth anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private
    key is just words or numbers, making it easier to hide. However, the owner of
    a crypto-asset has to take more steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have
    to be convinced that the owner can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress.
    Crypto-assets are the possessions of the future, but that future will not happen
    for mainstream users if holding those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery
    and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned the balance of constraints in security , convenience
    , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first
    angle for innovation in wallet technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience
    and security. The central dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and
    safe .Any new, better wallet technology generation must transcend the limiting
    tradeoff of the previous generation user experience. A growing portion of non-technical
    people can keep their crypto-assets secure at a lower cost, with greater ease.
    Wallet designers aim to rise in that upward spiral of security and convenience.
    We can compare wallet innovation to the development of mobile phones into smartphones.
    The functionality and convenience expand with each new generation. Much of the
    wallet market will likely be seized by companies that combine hardware and software.The
    tradeoff between convenience and security has leveled up three times already.
    We can watch the pattern and see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange
    websites: The easiest way to buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them
    on an exchange website. It is as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage
    account, but they only provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like
    a bank’s, and your bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the
    crypto-assets in custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets
    are much easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank.
    That risk is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile
    case in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between
    convenience and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.•    Some early Bitcoiners mined many
    coins but did not keep a backup. Corrupted hard drives or partners throwing out
    “old computers” have cost them dearly.•    Some people secured their crypto-assets
    with overly complicated methods, forgot a critical step, and could not recover
    their property.•    Some kept their security setup simple but forgot their password
    after an accident that involved a blow to the head, or forgot over time.•    After
    Bitcoin became more mainstream, thieves started targeting known holders with hacking,
    break-ins, or kidnapping combined with threats of violence.•    Hackers use phishing
    attacks, trojan horses, and infected websites to enter wallets on people’s personal
    computers. I witnessed one such case up close. The victim had $30,000 worth of
    crypto-assets on a laptop dedicated to this purpose, stored in multiple wallet
    applications. He had installed a Monero wallet that turned out to be malicious.
    After getting access to the computer, the attacker drained it and all his other
    wallets as well. The victim had a professional background in information technology,
    but there was nothing he could do to stop the theft after he downloaded that compromised
    wallet.Tragic events such as these are symptoms of the innovator stage of crypto-assets.
    We can look to a future where such problems are as rare as errors in a bank statement.
    In recent years, wallet designers have already addressed several of these security
    issues—we will cover this below.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets,
    we can compare types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each
    payment method has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle
    each of them as challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user
    to undertake a series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their
    goal. We distinguish these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For
    example, in some countries and for some people, applying for a credit card has
    a two-month lead time and represents a five-hour workload. In other countries,
    you get a functional credit card in the mail without even asking for it, provided
    that you have a good credit score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard,
    but credit cards are far from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter.
    This example shows that technology can have friction at different levels and points
    of contact, depending on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users
    and use empathy to find the points of friction for their target market.In the
    long term, we can expect each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a
    single wallet technology that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be
    built by new companies or open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet
    application will hold fiat currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat
    currency requires a banking license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets.
    That is why the fiat currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’
    fiat currency, usually dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves
    some of the problems of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter
    3\. A complete wallet will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets,
    and remove friction in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could
    develop similarly to the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and
    effortless utility. The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting
    telephone and publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The
    first step to mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent
    waves of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.
    Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions,
    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security
    experts have to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break
    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with
    a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets

    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder

    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third

    but there was nothing he could do to stop the theft after he downloaded that compromised
    wallet.Tragic events such as these are symptoms of the innovator stage of crypto-assets.
    We can look to a future where such problems are as rare as errors in a bank statement.
    In recent years, wallet designers have already addressed several of these security
    issues—we will cover this below.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets,
    we can compare types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each
    payment method has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle
    each of them as challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user
    to undertake a series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their
    goal. We distinguish these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For
    example, in some countries and for some people, applying for a credit card has
    a two-month lead time and represents a five-hour workload. In other countries,
    you get a functional credit card in the mail without even asking for it, provided
    that you have a good credit score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard,
    but credit cards are far from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter.
    This example shows that technology can have friction at different levels and points
    of contact, depending on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users
    and use empathy to find the points of friction for their target market.In the
    long term, we can expect each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a
    single wallet technology that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be
    built by new companies or open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet
    application will hold fiat currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat
    currency requires a banking license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets.
    That is why the fiat currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’
    fiat currency, usually dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves
    some of the problems of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter
    3\. A complete wallet will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets,
    and remove friction in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could
    develop similarly to the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and
    effortless utility. The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting
    telephone and publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The
    first step to mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent
    waves of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.
    Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions,
    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security
    experts have to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break
    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with
    a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.•    Some kept their security setup simple
    but forgot their password after an accident that involved a blow to the head,
    or forgot over time.•    After Bitcoin became more mainstream, thieves started
    targeting known holders with hacking, break-ins, or kidnapping combined with threats
    of violence.•    Hackers use phishing attacks, trojan horses, and infected websites
    to enter wallets on people’s personal computers. I witnessed one such case up
    close. The victim had $30,000 worth of crypto-assets on a laptop dedicated to
    this purpose, stored in multiple wallet applications. He had installed a Monero
    wallet that turned out to be malicious. After getting access to the computer,
    the attacker drained it and all his other wallets as well. The victim had a professional
    background in information technology, but there was nothing he could do to stop
    the theft after he downloaded that compromised wallet.Tragic events such as these
    are symptoms of the innovator stage of crypto-assets. We can look to a future
    where such problems are as rare as errors in a bank statement. In recent years,
    wallet designers have already addressed several of these security issues—we will
    cover this below.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets, we can compare
    types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each payment method
    has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle each of them as
    challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user to undertake a
    series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their goal. We distinguish
    these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For example, in some countries
    and for some people, applying for a credit card has a two-month lead time and
    represents a five-hour workload. In other countries, you get a functional credit
    card in the mail without even asking for it, provided that you have a good credit
    score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard, but credit cards are far
    from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter. This example shows that
    technology can have friction at different levels and points of contact, depending
    on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users and use empathy to find
    the points of friction for their target market.In the long term, we can expect
    each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a single wallet technology
    that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be built by new companies or
    open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet application will hold fiat
    currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat currency requires a banking
    license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets. That is why the fiat
    currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’ fiat currency, usually
    dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves some of the problems
    of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter 3\. A complete wallet
    will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets, and remove friction
    in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could develop similarly to
    the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and effortless utility.
    The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting telephone and
    publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The first step to
    mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent waves
    of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background

    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.•    After Bitcoin became more mainstream,
    thieves started targeting known holders with hacking, break-ins, or kidnapping
    combined with threats of violence.•    Hackers use phishing attacks, trojan horses,
    and infected websites to enter wallets on people’s personal computers. I witnessed
    one such case up close. The victim had $30,000 worth of crypto-assets on a laptop
    dedicated to this purpose, stored in multiple wallet applications. He had installed
    a Monero wallet that turned out to be malicious. After getting access to the computer,
    the attacker drained it and all his other wallets as well. The victim had a professional
    background in information technology, but there was nothing he could do to stop
    the theft after he downloaded that compromised wallet.Tragic events such as these
    are symptoms of the innovator stage of crypto-assets. We can look to a future
    where such problems are as rare as errors in a bank statement. In recent years,
    wallet designers have already addressed several of these security issues—we will
    cover this below.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets, we can compare
    types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each payment method
    has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle each of them as
    challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user to undertake a
    series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their goal. We distinguish
    these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For example, in some countries
    and for some people, applying for a credit card has a two-month lead time and
    represents a five-hour workload. In other countries, you get a functional credit
    card in the mail without even asking for it, provided that you have a good credit
    score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard, but credit cards are far
    from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter. This example shows that
    technology can have friction at different levels and points of contact, depending
    on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users and use empathy to find
    the points of friction for their target market.In the long term, we can expect
    each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a single wallet technology
    that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be built by new companies or
    open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet application will hold fiat
    currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat currency requires a banking
    license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets. That is why the fiat
    currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’ fiat currency, usually
    dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves some of the problems
    of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter 3\. A complete wallet
    will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets, and remove friction
    in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could develop similarly to
    the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and effortless utility.
    The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting telephone and
    publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The first step to
    mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent waves
    of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.
    Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions,
    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security
    experts have to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break
    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with
    a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.•    Hackers use phishing attacks, trojan
    horses, and infected websites to enter wallets on people’s personal computers.
    I witnessed one such case up close. The victim had $30,000 worth of crypto-assets
    on a laptop dedicated to this purpose, stored in multiple wallet applications.
    He had installed a Monero wallet that turned out to be malicious. After getting
    access to the computer, the attacker drained it and all his other wallets as well.
    The victim had a professional background in information technology, but there
    was nothing he could do to stop the theft after he downloaded that compromised
    wallet.Tragic events such as these are symptoms of the innovator stage of crypto-assets.
    We can look to a future where such problems are as rare as errors in a bank statement.
    In recent years, wallet designers have already addressed several of these security
    issues—we will cover this below.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets,
    we can compare types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each
    payment method has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle
    each of them as challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user
    to undertake a series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their
    goal. We distinguish these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For
    example, in some countries and for some people, applying for a credit card has
    a two-month lead time and represents a five-hour workload. In other countries,
    you get a functional credit card in the mail without even asking for it, provided
    that you have a good credit score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard,
    but credit cards are far from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter.
    This example shows that technology can have friction at different levels and points
    of contact, depending on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users
    and use empathy to find the points of friction for their target market.In the
    long term, we can expect each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a
    single wallet technology that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be
    built by new companies or open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet
    application will hold fiat currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat
    currency requires a banking license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets.
    That is why the fiat currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’
    fiat currency, usually dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves
    some of the problems of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter
    3\. A complete wallet will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets,
    and remove friction in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could
    develop similarly to the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and
    effortless utility. The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting
    telephone and publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The
    first step to mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent
    waves of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.

    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security

    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with

    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.Tragic events such as these are symptoms
    of the innovator stage of crypto-assets. We can look to a future where such problems
    are as rare as errors in a bank statement. In recent years, wallet designers have
    already addressed several of these security issues—we will cover this below.Remove
    FrictionTo generate design ideas for wallets, we can compare types of money and
    payment technologies in terms of friction. Each payment method has medium-specific
    limitations, and wallet startups can tackle each of them as challenges to solve.
    A financial transaction requires the user to undertake a series of actions inside
    a user interface in order to reach their goal. We distinguish these steps as a)
    user onboarding and b) repeated use. For example, in some countries and for some
    people, applying for a credit card has a two-month lead time and represents a
    five-hour workload. In other countries, you get a functional credit card in the
    mail without even asking for it, provided that you have a good credit score. Using
    a credit card in daily life is standard, but credit cards are far from ideal money,
    as discussed in the previous chapter. This example shows that technology can have
    friction at different levels and points of contact, depending on the user’s characteristics.
    Designers can watch users and use empathy to find the points of friction for their
    target market.In the long term, we can expect each of the methods of payments
    to get bundled into a single wallet technology that supports crypto-assets. This
    technology will be built by new companies or open-source groups, not by banks.
    A complete wallet application will hold fiat currency as well, but keeping regular
    electronic fiat currency requires a banking license, while banks are unsuited
    to support crypto-assets. That is why the fiat currency in this type of wallet
    will likely be ‘stablecoins:’ fiat currency, usually dollars, represented by tokens
    on a blockchain. That solves some of the problems of the on-ramp and off-ramp,
    which we discussed in Chapter 3\. A complete wallet will hold at least all the
    well-known and liquid crypto-assets, and remove friction in fiat currency/cryptocurrency
    trades.Crypto-assets could develop similarly to the internet: from strange and
    risky experiment to safe and effortless utility. The innovators who built the
    internet could only start disrupting telephone and publishing companies when they
    began serving the mainstream. The first step to mainstream adoption was the development
    of internet browsers. Subsequent waves of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough
    video, BitTorrent, social networks, and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets
    depends on a wallet design that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving,
    investing, and speculation. We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing
    ideas of how money works. For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration
    is still low; we are in the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough
    to use it, you are an innovator—like users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator
    has a unique opportunity: you could accept responsibility for moving the field
    of crypto-assets forward by reaching early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement
    of ordinary paper and digital money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we
    still have to build that future. That paradox points to the work of an innovator;
    as an entrepreneur, you need a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under
    the HoodIn available technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In
    the early stages of development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears
    move into the background until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for
    the user to enjoy. The perfect sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just
    a window into somewhere else. Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable
    and that cars run on explosions, like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe
    little space under the hood. The internet used to run on phone networks optimized
    for human voices, which is why your computer made strange noises when it was dialing
    into the system to go online. Now the internet has become a general abstraction,
    a utility like water and electricity. In time, people will be online without having
    heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G. Whenever the connection breaks, they will be
    surprised that they can not study, work, or talk to their friends.We have to push
    the usability of crypto-assets onto a similar path. The history of technological
    development shows that the ideas we need are right under our noses. However, homo
    sapiens tend to be myopic, locked into the status quo of our surroundings and
    routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning resists change because change often means
    danger. Interface designers and security experts have to transcend that ancient
    instinct and use their imagination to break free of dated models and traditions.The
    Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with a user interface with many imaginable
    designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example, anyone can use a pair of scissors,
    while it takes training to fly a plane. That illustrates the vast design space
    that blockchain interface designers have to explore. The possibilities for wallet
    designs are endless, and only a small portion of those will function in practice.
    Some designs will be found quickly, while others will take years to discover.
    In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from the maturation of internet software
    as a historical parallel.The first distinct advantage that the internet offered
    was e-mail: users send messages to someone on their contact list, they have an
    inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that the next step is: let users connect
    to strangers and send them messages. On the surface, it appears an equally simple
    design challenge. You collect a group of strangers on a website and give them
    each an inbox and a profile. A dating site, for example. However, it took about
    fifteen years for dating sites to develop from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’
    Other examples that illustrate the size of the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn.
    Both platforms match employers with employees or freelancers, yet their target
    audiences and visions are different. Websites and applications specific to online
    dating or job matching are now somewhere in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical
    parallel suggests that Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies have many details
    to tweak until we have a quality experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch
    the design space for crypto-wallets, let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs
    that we face now, in this early stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets
    are a type of information; they are scarce but not made from material substances.
    This lightness of valuable information generates specific risks for wallet users,
    which designers have to manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with
    a public key, at an ‘address’ secured with a private key. Public and private keys
    are big numbers, represented as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s
    keys are the most crucial element; whoever controls the private keys controls
    the crypto-assets, so the private keys to your crypto-assets should never leave
    your device.On the one hand, the keys are what the bad guys want to steal, and
    on the other hand, you must always have a backup of the keys in case you lose
    or damage the hardware device. Although keys are information, the risk is physical
    because a criminal could coerce the owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets.
    This security tradeoff is the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets
    should be easy to use, but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk.
    You can boost security by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in
    terms of money or hassle.The dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble
    a substance that is also liquid and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle
    this oily explosive with care because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned
    to stabilize nitroglycerine with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting
    tunnels through mountains or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still
    a dangerous substance. Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover
    the ‘absorbents’ of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users
    from theft and loss.Part of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found
    in history and nature. Before liquid assets could be information, they were always
    physical objects, such as jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets
    you must either hide or defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could
    target you for robbery. Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters
    choose to act without the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to
    most people who prefer to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership,
    such as assets in a bank. Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary
    people protect their wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal
    system. This is the primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat
    can nature tell us about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that
    save food for the future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become
    smart enough or strong enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ
    an army of kamikaze pilots. They answer force with force. There are also other
    approaches used by non-violent animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does
    cache spacing : hiding food in separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible
    portfolio manager. A competitor could discover one cache, but the other caches
    stay hidden. Squirrels and other rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the
    exact location of about 1200 nuts and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity”
    measures, civilians could hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden
    or protected backups are already part of the current best wallet designs.Design
    TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets is, in some ways, easier than owning material things.
    You can transport your wealth anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private
    key is just words or numbers, making it easier to hide. However, the owner of
    a crypto-asset has to take more steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have
    to be convinced that the owner can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress.
    Crypto-assets are the possessions of the future, but that future will not happen
    for mainstream users if holding those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery
    and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned the balance of constraints in security , convenience
    , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first
    angle for innovation in wallet technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience
    and security. The central dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and
    safe .Any new, better wallet technology generation must transcend the limiting
    tradeoff of the previous generation user experience. A growing portion of non-technical
    people can keep their crypto-assets secure at a lower cost, with greater ease.
    Wallet designers aim to rise in that upward spiral of security and convenience.
    We can compare wallet innovation to the development of mobile phones into smartphones.
    The functionality and convenience expand with each new generation. Much of the
    wallet market will likely be seized by companies that combine hardware and software.The
    tradeoff between convenience and security has leveled up three times already.
    We can watch the pattern and see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange
    websites: The easiest way to buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them
    on an exchange website. It is as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage
    account, but they only provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like
    a bank’s, and your bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the
    crypto-assets in custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets
    are much easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank.
    That risk is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile
    case in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between
    convenience and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.Remove FrictionTo generate design ideas
    for wallets, we can compare types of money and payment technologies in terms of
    friction. Each payment method has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups
    can tackle each of them as challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires
    the user to undertake a series of actions inside a user interface in order to
    reach their goal. We distinguish these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated
    use. For example, in some countries and for some people, applying for a credit
    card has a two-month lead time and represents a five-hour workload. In other countries,
    you get a functional credit card in the mail without even asking for it, provided
    that you have a good credit score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard,
    but credit cards are far from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter.
    This example shows that technology can have friction at different levels and points
    of contact, depending on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users
    and use empathy to find the points of friction for their target market.In the
    long term, we can expect each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a
    single wallet technology that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be
    built by new companies or open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet
    application will hold fiat currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat
    currency requires a banking license, while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets.
    That is why the fiat currency in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’
    fiat currency, usually dollars, represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves
    some of the problems of the on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter
    3\. A complete wallet will hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets,
    and remove friction in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could
    develop similarly to the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and
    effortless utility. The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting
    telephone and publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The
    first step to mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent
    waves of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.
    Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions,
    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security
    experts have to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break
    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with
    a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.To generate design ideas for wallets,
    we can compare types of money and payment technologies in terms of friction. Each
    payment method has medium-specific limitations, and wallet startups can tackle
    each of them as challenges to solve. A financial transaction requires the user
    to undertake a series of actions inside a user interface in order to reach their
    goal. We distinguish these steps as a) user onboarding and b) repeated use. For
    example, in some countries and for some people, applying for a credit card has
    a two-month lead time and represents a five-hour workload. In other countries,
    you get a functional credit card in the mail without even asking for it, provided
    that you have a good credit score. Using a credit card in daily life is standard,
    but credit cards are far from ideal money, as discussed in the previous chapter.
    This example shows that technology can have friction at different levels and points
    of contact, depending on the user’s characteristics. Designers can watch users
    and use empathy to find the points of friction for their target market.In the
    long term, we can expect each of the methods of payments to get bundled into a
    single wallet technology that supports crypto-assets. This technology will be
    built by new companies or open-source groups, not by banks. A complete wallet
    application will hold fiat currency as well, but keeping regular electronic fiat

    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.In the long term, we can expect each
    of the methods of payments to get bundled into a single wallet technology that
    supports crypto-assets. This technology will be built by new companies or open-source
    groups, not by banks. A complete wallet application will hold fiat currency as
    well, but keeping regular electronic fiat currency requires a banking license,
    while banks are unsuited to support crypto-assets. That is why the fiat currency
    in this type of wallet will likely be ‘stablecoins:’ fiat currency, usually dollars,
    represented by tokens on a blockchain. That solves some of the problems of the
    on-ramp and off-ramp, which we discussed in Chapter 3\. A complete wallet will
    hold at least all the well-known and liquid crypto-assets, and remove friction
    in fiat currency/cryptocurrency trades.Crypto-assets could develop similarly to
    the internet: from strange and risky experiment to safe and effortless utility.
    The innovators who built the internet could only start disrupting telephone and
    publishing companies when they began serving the mainstream. The first step to
    mainstream adoption was the development of internet browsers. Subsequent waves
    of adoption relied on webmail, fast-enough video, BitTorrent, social networks,
    and smartphones.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets depends on a wallet design
    that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving, investing, and speculation.
    We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing ideas of how money works.
    For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration is still low; we are in
    the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough to use it, you are an innovator—like
    users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator has a unique opportunity: you
    could accept responsibility for moving the field of crypto-assets forward by reaching
    early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement of ordinary paper and digital
    money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we still have to build that future.
    That paradox points to the work of an innovator; as an entrepreneur, you need
    a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under the HoodIn available
    technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of
    development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears move into the background
    until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect
    sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else.
    Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions,
    like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The
    internet used to run on phone networks optimized for human voices, which is why
    your computer made strange noises when it was dialing into the system to go online.
    Now the internet has become a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity.
    In time, people will be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G.
    Whenever the connection breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study,
    work, or talk to their friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets
    onto a similar path. The history of technological development shows that the ideas
    we need are right under our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked
    into the status quo of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning
    resists change because change often means danger. Interface designers and security
    experts have to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break
    free of dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with
    a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage

    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success

    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets
    depends on a wallet design that offers new metaphors for spending, earning, saving,
    investing, and speculation. We have to adapt the money interface to people’s existing
    ideas of how money works. For crypto-assets, the percentage of market penetration
    is still low; we are in the innovator stage. If you understand it well enough
    to use it, you are an innovator—like users of the internet in 1995\. Every innovator
    has a unique opportunity: you could accept responsibility for moving the field
    of crypto-assets forward by reaching early adopters. When we zoom out, the replacement
    of ordinary paper and digital money by crypto-assets seems inevitable, but we
    still have to build that future. That paradox points to the work of an innovator;
    as an entrepreneur, you need a sense of destiny combined with a sense of urgency.Under
    the HoodIn available technology, complications are hidden “under the hood.” In
    the early stages of development, you see and hear all the gears. Then the gears
    move into the background until they disappear, leaving pure functionality for
    the user to enjoy. The perfect sound system is just sound. The ideal TV is just
    a window into somewhere else. Small children do not know that gasoline is flammable
    and that cars run on explosions, like dangerous fireworks, enclosed in a safe
    little space under the hood. The internet used to run on phone networks optimized
    for human voices, which is why your computer made strange noises when it was dialing
    into the system to go online. Now the internet has become a general abstraction,
    a utility like water and electricity. In time, people will be online without having
    heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G. Whenever the connection breaks, they will be
    surprised that they can not study, work, or talk to their friends.We have to push
    the usability of crypto-assets onto a similar path. The history of technological
    development shows that the ideas we need are right under our noses. However, homo
    sapiens tend to be myopic, locked into the status quo of our surroundings and
    routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning resists change because change often means
    danger. Interface designers and security experts have to transcend that ancient
    instinct and use their imagination to break free of dated models and traditions.The
    Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with a user interface with many imaginable
    designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example, anyone can use a pair of scissors,
    while it takes training to fly a plane. That illustrates the vast design space
    that blockchain interface designers have to explore. The possibilities for wallet
    designs are endless, and only a small portion of those will function in practice.
    Some designs will be found quickly, while others will take years to discover.
    In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from the maturation of internet software
    as a historical parallel.The first distinct advantage that the internet offered
    was e-mail: users send messages to someone on their contact list, they have an
    inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that the next step is: let users connect
    to strangers and send them messages. On the surface, it appears an equally simple
    design challenge. You collect a group of strangers on a website and give them
    each an inbox and a profile. A dating site, for example. However, it took about
    fifteen years for dating sites to develop from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’
    Other examples that illustrate the size of the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn.
    Both platforms match employers with employees or freelancers, yet their target
    audiences and visions are different. Websites and applications specific to online
    dating or job matching are now somewhere in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical
    parallel suggests that Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies have many details
    to tweak until we have a quality experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch
    the design space for crypto-wallets, let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs
    that we face now, in this early stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets
    are a type of information; they are scarce but not made from material substances.
    This lightness of valuable information generates specific risks for wallet users,
    which designers have to manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with
    a public key, at an ‘address’ secured with a private key. Public and private keys
    are big numbers, represented as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s
    keys are the most crucial element; whoever controls the private keys controls
    the crypto-assets, so the private keys to your crypto-assets should never leave
    your device.On the one hand, the keys are what the bad guys want to steal, and
    on the other hand, you must always have a backup of the keys in case you lose
    or damage the hardware device. Although keys are information, the risk is physical
    because a criminal could coerce the owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets.
    This security tradeoff is the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets
    should be easy to use, but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk.
    You can boost security by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in
    terms of money or hassle.The dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble
    a substance that is also liquid and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle
    this oily explosive with care because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned
    to stabilize nitroglycerine with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting
    tunnels through mountains or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still
    a dangerous substance. Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover
    the ‘absorbents’ of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users
    from theft and loss.Part of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found
    in history and nature. Before liquid assets could be information, they were always
    physical objects, such as jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets
    you must either hide or defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could
    target you for robbery. Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters
    choose to act without the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to
    most people who prefer to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership,
    such as assets in a bank. Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary
    people protect their wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal
    system. This is the primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat
    can nature tell us about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that
    save food for the future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become
    smart enough or strong enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ
    an army of kamikaze pilots. They answer force with force. There are also other
    approaches used by non-violent animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does
    cache spacing : hiding food in separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible
    portfolio manager. A competitor could discover one cache, but the other caches
    stay hidden. Squirrels and other rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the
    exact location of about 1200 nuts and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity”
    measures, civilians could hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden
    or protected backups are already part of the current best wallet designs.Design
    TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets is, in some ways, easier than owning material things.
    You can transport your wealth anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private
    key is just words or numbers, making it easier to hide. However, the owner of
    a crypto-asset has to take more steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have
    to be convinced that the owner can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress.
    Crypto-assets are the possessions of the future, but that future will not happen
    for mainstream users if holding those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery
    and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned the balance of constraints in security , convenience
    , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first
    angle for innovation in wallet technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience
    and security. The central dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and
    safe .Any new, better wallet technology generation must transcend the limiting
    tradeoff of the previous generation user experience. A growing portion of non-technical
    people can keep their crypto-assets secure at a lower cost, with greater ease.
    Wallet designers aim to rise in that upward spiral of security and convenience.
    We can compare wallet innovation to the development of mobile phones into smartphones.
    The functionality and convenience expand with each new generation. Much of the
    wallet market will likely be seized by companies that combine hardware and software.The
    tradeoff between convenience and security has leveled up three times already.
    We can watch the pattern and see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange
    websites: The easiest way to buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them
    on an exchange website. It is as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage
    account, but they only provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like
    a bank’s, and your bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the
    crypto-assets in custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets
    are much easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank.
    That risk is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile
    case in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between
    convenience and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay

    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.In available technology, complications
    are hidden “under the hood.” In the early stages of development, you see and hear
    all the gears. Then the gears move into the background until they disappear, leaving
    pure functionality for the user to enjoy. The perfect sound system is just sound.
    The ideal TV is just a window into somewhere else. Small children do not know
    that gasoline is flammable and that cars run on explosions, like dangerous fireworks,
    enclosed in a safe little space under the hood. The internet used to run on phone
    networks optimized for human voices, which is why your computer made strange noises
    when it was dialing into the system to go online. Now the internet has become
    a general abstraction, a utility like water and electricity. In time, people will
    be online without having heard of WiFi, Bluetooth, and 5G. Whenever the connection
    breaks, they will be surprised that they can not study, work, or talk to their
    friends.We have to push the usability of crypto-assets onto a similar path. The
    history of technological development shows that the ideas we need are right under
    our noses. However, homo sapiens tend to be myopic, locked into the status quo
    of our surroundings and routines. Hunter-gatherer conditioning resists change
    because change often means danger. Interface designers and security experts have
    to transcend that ancient instinct and use their imagination to break free of
    dated models and traditions.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools with a user
    interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity. For example,
    anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly a plane. That
    illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers have to
    explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a small portion
    of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly, while
    others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration from
    the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more

    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.The Design SpaceCrypto-wallets are tools
    with a user interface with many imaginable designs. Tools vary in complexity.
    For example, anyone can use a pair of scissors, while it takes training to fly
    a plane. That illustrates the vast design space that blockchain interface designers
    have to explore. The possibilities for wallet designs are endless, and only a
    small portion of those will function in practice. Some designs will be found quickly,
    while others will take years to discover. In the meantime, we can draw inspiration
    from the maturation of internet software as a historical parallel.The first distinct
    advantage that the internet offered was e-mail: users send messages to someone
    on their contact list, they have an inbox, an outbox, etc. You could imagine that
    the next step is: let users connect to strangers and send them messages. On the
    surface, it appears an equally simple design challenge. You collect a group of
    strangers on a website and give them each an inbox and a profile. A dating site,
    for example. However, it took about fifteen years for dating sites to develop
    from ‘terrible’ into ‘good enough.’ Other examples that illustrate the size of
    the design space are Upwork and LinkedIn. Both platforms match employers with
    employees or freelancers, yet their target audiences and visions are different.
    Websites and applications specific to online dating or job matching are now somewhere
    in the ‘early majority’ stage. This historical parallel suggests that Bitcoin
    and other blockchain technologies have many details to tweak until we have a quality
    experience to offer mainstream users. To sketch the design space for crypto-wallets,
    let’s have a look at the challenges and tradeoffs that we face now, in this early
    stage.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets are a type of information;
    they are scarce but not made from material substances. This lightness of valuable
    information generates specific risks for wallet users, which designers have to
    manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with a public key, at an ‘address’
    secured with a private key. Public and private keys are big numbers, represented
    as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s keys are the most crucial element;
    whoever controls the private keys controls the crypto-assets, so the private keys
    to your crypto-assets should never leave your device.On the one hand, the keys
    are what the bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have
    a backup of the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although
    keys are information, the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the
    owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is
    the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use,
    but the designer faces a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security
    by removing risk, which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The
    dangers of theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid
    and volatile: nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care
    because if it vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine
    with absorbents, giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains
    or demolishing buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance.
    Security experts and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’
    of crypto-assets—the methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part
    of the solution to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before
    liquid assets could be information, they were always physical objects, such as
    jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or
    defend. If you keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery.
    Professional criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without
    the protection of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer
    to stay civilians, with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank.
    Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their
    wealth from theft and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the
    primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us
    about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the
    future have, under the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong
    enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots.
    They answer force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent
    animals. For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in
    separate locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are

    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff

    the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the owner into surrendering
    the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is the number one concern
    of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use, but the designer faces
    a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security by removing risk,
    which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The dangers of
    theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid and volatile:
    nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care because if it
    vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine with absorbents,
    giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains or demolishing
    buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance. Security experts
    and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’ of crypto-assets—the
    methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part of the solution
    to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before liquid assets
    could be information, they were always physical objects, such as jewelry, gold
    bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or defend. If you
    keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery. Professional
    criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without the protection
    of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer to stay civilians,
    with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank. Mainstream adoption
    of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their wealth from theft
    and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the primary challenge
    of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us about keeping our
    valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the future have, under
    the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong enough to protect
    it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots. They answer
    force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent animals.
    For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in separate
    locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.The Risks of Holding Private KeysCrypto-assets
    are a type of information; they are scarce but not made from material substances.
    This lightness of valuable information generates specific risks for wallet users,
    which designers have to manage. Crypto-assets are stored on a blockchain with
    a public key, at an ‘address’ secured with a private key. Public and private keys
    are big numbers, represented as strings of digits and characters. The wallet’s
    keys are the most crucial element; whoever controls the private keys controls
    the crypto-assets, so the private keys to your crypto-assets should never leave
    your device.On the one hand, the keys are what the bad guys want to steal, and
    on the other hand, you must always have a backup of the keys in case you lose
    or damage the hardware device. Although keys are information, the risk is physical
    because a criminal could coerce the owner into surrendering the key to the crypto-assets.
    This security tradeoff is the number one concern of wallet functionality.Wallets

    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.On the one hand, the keys are what the
    bad guys want to steal, and on the other hand, you must always have a backup of
    the keys in case you lose or damage the hardware device. Although keys are information,
    the risk is physical because a criminal could coerce the owner into surrendering
    the key to the crypto-assets. This security tradeoff is the number one concern
    of wallet functionality.Wallets should be easy to use, but the designer faces
    a dilemma: convenience implies risk. You can boost security by removing risk,
    which means the users pay the price in terms of money or hassle.The dangers of
    theft or loss of crypto-assets resemble a substance that is also liquid and volatile:
    nitroglycerine. One has to handle this oily explosive with care because if it
    vibrates, it blows up. Chemists learned to stabilize nitroglycerine with absorbents,
    giving you dynamite, a tool for blasting tunnels through mountains or demolishing
    buildings. Today, crypto-assets are still a dangerous substance. Security experts
    and interface designers have yet to discover the ‘absorbents’ of crypto-assets—the
    methods that protect non-technical users from theft and loss.Part of the solution
    to secure crypto-assets can be found in history and nature. Before liquid assets
    could be information, they were always physical objects, such as jewelry, gold
    bars, silver coins, and gemstones—assets you must either hide or defend. If you
    keep your assets close by, criminals could target you for robbery. Professional
    criminals such as blackhat hackers and gangsters choose to act without the protection
    of a democratic nation-state as opposed to most people who prefer to stay civilians,
    with legal protection for ownership, such as assets in a bank. Mainstream adoption
    of crypto-assets requires that ordinary people protect their wealth from theft
    and extortion without relying on the legal system. This is the primary challenge
    of wallet technology.Naturally SecureWhat can nature tell us about keeping our
    valuables secure? Some animal species that save food for the future have, under
    the pressure of natural selection, become smart enough or strong enough to protect
    it. Bees, the makers of honey, employ an army of kamikaze pilots. They answer
    force with force. There are also other approaches used by non-violent animals.
    For example, the western scrub-jay does cache spacing : hiding food in separate
    locations. It spreads risk like a responsible portfolio manager. A competitor
    could discover one cache, but the other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other
    rodents do scatter hoarding . They remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts
    and seeds. With similar “security through obscurity” measures, civilians could
    hold more wealth with less risk. Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are
    already part of the current best wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA

    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.Part of the solution to secure crypto-assets
    can be found in history and nature. Before liquid assets could be information,
    they were always physical objects, such as jewelry, gold bars, silver coins, and
    gemstones—assets you must either hide or defend. If you keep your assets close
    by, criminals could target you for robbery. Professional criminals such as blackhat
    hackers and gangsters choose to act without the protection of a democratic nation-state
    as opposed to most people who prefer to stay civilians, with legal protection
    for ownership, such as assets in a bank. Mainstream adoption of crypto-assets
    requires that ordinary people protect their wealth from theft and extortion without
    relying on the legal system. This is the primary challenge of wallet technology.Naturally
    SecureWhat can nature tell us about keeping our valuables secure? Some animal
    species that save food for the future have, under the pressure of natural selection,
    become smart enough or strong enough to protect it. Bees, the makers of honey,
    employ an army of kamikaze pilots. They answer force with force. There are also
    other approaches used by non-violent animals. For example, the western scrub-jay
    does cache spacing : hiding food in separate locations. It spreads risk like a
    responsible portfolio manager. A competitor could discover one cache, but the
    other caches stay hidden. Squirrels and other rodents do scatter hoarding . They
    remember the exact location of about 1200 nuts and seeds. With similar “security
    through obscurity” measures, civilians could hold more wealth with less risk.
    Memory aids and hidden or protected backups are already part of the current best
    wallet designs.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets is, in some ways, easier than
    owning material things. You can transport your wealth anywhere safely, at little
    cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers, making it easier to hide.
    However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more steps to deter coercion.
    Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner can not access the keys
    now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions of the future, but
    that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding those assets puts
    people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned the balance
    of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer, Cybersecurity
    and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet technology
    is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central dilemma
    is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet technology
    generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation user
    experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage

    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.Design TradeoffsOwning crypto-assets
    is, in some ways, easier than owning material things. You can transport your wealth
    anywhere safely, at little cost. Also, a private key is just words or numbers,
    making it easier to hide. However, the owner of a crypto-asset has to take more
    steps to deter coercion. Potential robbers have to be convinced that the owner
    can not access the keys now, or ever, under duress. Crypto-assets are the possessions
    of the future, but that future will not happen for mainstream users if holding
    those assets puts people at risk of violent robbery and extortion.Chapter 1 mentioned
    the balance of constraints in security , convenience , and freedom (Dan Geer,
    Cybersecurity and National Policy , 2010). The first angle for innovation in wallet
    technology is leveling up tradeoffs between convenience and security. The central
    dilemma is between easy and risky , or complicated and safe .Any new, better wallet
    technology generation must transcend the limiting tradeoff of the previous generation
    user experience. A growing portion of non-technical people can keep their crypto-assets
    secure at a lower cost, with greater ease. Wallet designers aim to rise in that
    upward spiral of security and convenience. We can compare wallet innovation to
    the development of mobile phones into smartphones. The functionality and convenience
    expand with each new generation. Much of the wallet market will likely be seized
    by companies that combine hardware and software.The tradeoff between convenience
    and security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and
    see how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to
    buy and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is
    as easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only
    provide the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your
    bank is mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in
    custody, making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much
    easier to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk
    is not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s

    the banking system, which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp
    are only temporary solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because
    they have to comply with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets
    into people’s hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in
    the future of money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets
    in a way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.The tradeoff between convenience and
    security has leveled up three times already. We can watch the pattern and see
    how wallet technology is developing:Exchange websites: The easiest way to buy
    and store your crypto-assets is to keep them on an exchange website. It is as
    easy as interacting with an online bank or brokerage account, but they only provide
    the illusion of security. The interface looks like a bank’s, and your bank is
    mostly secure. However, the exchange website has the crypto-assets in custody,
    making for a ‘honey pot’ that attracts hackers. Crypto-assets are much easier
    to hack from an exchange than digital fiat currency from a bank. That risk is
    not theoretical. Exchanges get robbed regularly; there is a high-profile case
    in the news every few months. This primitive level of the tradeoff between convenience
    and security can not continue for long.Hot wallets: The current crypto-wallets
    force the user into unpleasant choices. You can use ‘hot wallets,’ which stay
    connected to the internet, for receiving smaller amounts of crypto-assets that
    remain available for quick spending. The best hot wallets are well-designed and
    easy to use after the user understands the basics. The usability tempts the user
    to keep all their assets in that wallet, which is too risky. Carrying too much
    value in a hot wallet is not advisable because hackers can infect it remotely
    with a virus that steals your assets. Or robbers can take it by threatening the
    user, just like sometimes happens with valuable stores in a safe.Hardware wallets:
    You can pay for more security and still retain some convenience with hardware
    wallets. You can always spend the assets without too much work, but it is more
    hassle than sending them from an exchange or hot wallet. Hardware wallets protect
    crypto assets better than exchange websites and hot wallets because it is harder
    to attack a hardware wallet remotely.Multi-signature wallets and off-site backups:
    Some wallet solutions automatically keep a secure, off-site backup for recovery.
    Others can boost security by spreading the ability to spend over multiple locations,
    devices, or people.Custodial cold wallets: For now, the highest combination of
    security and convenience is ‘cold storage’ with a custodian: someone else takes
    responsibility for securing your assets, and they keep the private keys offline,
    protected from remote hackers. You outsource the risk of theft and extortion,
    but you make yourself vulnerable to that third party. In case they are a company,
    they are regulated and insured like banks, and your assets are on the books for
    taxation. It also means that you accept the risk of the local authorities confiscating
    your crypto-assets, for whatever reason. In Geer’s triangle terms, you sacrifice
    a measure of freedom for a better deal on convenience and security.In summary:
    Hardware wallets have leveled up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what
    the market has converged on for most situations. An even higher security level
    is possible with cold storage, where you expend more effort to keep your private
    keys in a physical form only without a connection to the internet. Cold storage
    with a custodian means that someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on
    a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they sit in
    a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge covering
    hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models, and
    interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a team
    that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If

    depend on a third party. For example, no one can get to your assets because they
    sit in a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets are a multi-disciplinary design challenge
    covering hardware manufacturing, software security, “threat models,” mental models,
    and interface design. Companies that want to build a competitive wallet need a
    team that touches on all those fields. It can be a challenging journey. As a wallet
    customer, I have prepaid for a next-generation hardware wallet in a crowdfunding
    campaign, and their progress has halted along the way. I’m rooting for them to
    finish and deliver a cutting-edge product, but it seems that wallets’ market success
    is won the hard way. A company’s rewards for designing and building wallets right
    are as high as the risks for getting it wrong.Remove the Need for CustodiansA
    custodian who keeps your crypto-assets in cold storage is the equivalent of holding
    valuables in a safe deposit box with a traditional bank. You choose to trust them
    fully and minimize the risk of losing the keys through any error of your own.
    An adversary would need a court order to confiscate your crypto-assets, which
    is possible but in most situations, unlikely. If you encrypt the key, they cannot
    access your assets. Crypto-asset custodians come in two varieties: a) they are
    regulated, know how much you own, and have insurance against heists. Or b) they
    are unregulated like “money guards,” they are a private person you trust, like
    a neighbor or family member. These money guards are standard in the developing
    world. These two types of custodians work well for many people, but they do not
    make use of the unique properties of crypto-assets. You and your money guard are
    still vulnerable to extortion, and you have to trust them.To transcend the tradeoff
    between convenience and security, developers and entrepreneurs have to apply their
    imagination to make a wallet that is as secure as a custodian, without making
    the user vulnerable to a third party or potential robbers. That kind of wallet
    will support both the convenience of online exchange and the security of cold
    storage. Ideally, we do not want our assets under any central control. By rising
    to the challenge of storing crypto-assets safely without custodians, we move forward
    on a trajectory to disrupt the central authority of money and finance.For next-generation
    wallets, startups can aspire to that security level, with users in full control
    of their wealth, with only a simple physical device that keeps the backup phrase
    and as easy to use as physical cash. Theft and loss protections are built-in.
    When holders can control and secure their crypto-assets without trusted third
    parties, banks and regulators will no longer have the power to frustrate owners
    according to random dictates. Typical current banking relationships have us paying
    third parties to handle everything, while customer experience is mediocre at best.If
    we demand a smooth cryptocurrency experience, we have to bypass the banking system,
    which means exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp are only temporary
    solutions. They are too centralized and bureaucratic because they have to comply
    with banking regulations. We need something that gets crypto-assets into people’s
    hands naturally, which is how new owners will become invested in the future of
    money.Furthermore, we have to design the next generation of crypto-assets in a
    way that annihilates the incentive to hack or coerce. It should be impossible
    or prohibitively hard for potential thieves to reach crypto-assets. Owning crypto-assets
    must be safe and convenient for everyone so that all those independent owners
    together become a political constituency.In summary: Hardware wallets have leveled
    up the dilemma of easy versus safe . This is what the market has converged on
    for most situations. An even higher security level is possible with cold storage,
    where you expend more effort to keep your private keys in a physical form only
    without a connection to the internet. Cold storage with a custodian means that
    someone else holds the keys secure; you depend on a third party. For example,
    no one can get to your assets because they sit in a bunker in Switzerland.Wallets
