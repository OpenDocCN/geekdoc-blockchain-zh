- en: ConclusionEven though there has been tons of enthusiasm around Blockchain and
    how it shot up to the top spot in the tech world, there are analysts with pessimistic
    views. The biggest talking point is that it can turn pretty much any industry
    on its head. Blockchain promises to transform how we transact, how we enter into
    contracts and how we protect data. Analysts have likened Blockchain to the internet,
    stating that it could be more than twenty years before we see blockchain being
    a part of how businesses operate on a daily basis. If central authorities and
    businesses seriously invest in the infrastructure and rework how they operate,
    then we would be able to see more extensive use of blockchain technology.We cannot
    predict the future, but the prospective advantages of blockchain are at least
    fascinating enough for there to be some sort of insurgence far into the future.If
    you are just starting out on your software development journey, you can’t be too
    hard on yourself if you don’t grasp everything at lightning speed. If you learn
    with the end goal in mind, it will be a smoother process.Having the aptitude to
    fully understand blockchain and its concepts will always be an advantage to you.
    You may find yourself working on ICO projects. Initial Coin Offering is to the
    cryptocurrency industry what an IPO is to the business world. Companies use ICOs
    to raise the funds necessary to create a new coin, application or service.One
    of the main benefits of learning blockchain is that it’s in high demand, so you
    will probably never be without work. If you choose not to have a career in the
    blockchain industry, you can always teach, it’s an excellent way to make money.It’s
    fairly new, so only 0.5% of the population is using it right now. If you start
    learning it today, you will be at the forefront of its development by the time
    it has gained more traction.The demand for Blockchain shot up almost 2000% and
    it became one of the most sought after skills in the tech industry. It is estimated
    that by 2024 the Blockchain market’s net worth will be valued at $20 billion.
    Right now, a significant number of banks are implementing Blockchain technology
    to improve the quality of their service and to tighten up their security.The cities
    with the most openings are New York, San Francisco and San Jose and the median
    salary for a blockchain developer stands at $154,550 as of 2022\. There is always
    room to grow in this field as the technology improves and advances. You should
    become a blockchain developer because:● The demand for Blockchain developers far
    outweighs the supply. This means the job market is not saturated and probably
    will not be for a long time.● The salaries are among some of the most competitive
    in the tech space right now. With the right amount of drive and experience, you
    could earn up to $200,000 a year.● You get to be involved in revolutionizing the
    way the financial market operates.A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners

  zh: 尽管围绕区块链的热情高涨，并且它一跃成为科技界的佼佼者，但也有一些分析师持悲观态度。最大的争论焦点是，它可能会彻底颠覆任何行业。区块链承诺转变我们交易的方式，我们签署合同的方式，以及我们保护数据的方式。分析师将区块链比作互联网，声称可能要过二十年才会看到区块链成为企业日常运营的一部分。如果中央当局和企业真正投资基础设施并改造他们的运营方式，那么我们将能够看到更广泛的区块链技术应用。我们无法预测未来，但区块链的潜在优势至少足够引人入胜，以至于在未来会产生一定程度的涌现。如果您刚开始软件开发之旅，如果您不能以迅雷不及掩耳之势掌握一切，也不必对自己太苛刻。如果你以终点为目标学习，整个过程会更加顺畅。完全理解区块链及其概念将始终是您的优势。您可能会发现自己正在参与ICO项目。初始代币发行对加密货币行业而言，就像IPO对商业界而言一样重要。公司使用ICO来筹集创建新币、应用或服务所需的资金。学习区块链的主要好处之一是它的需求量很高，所以您可能永远不会失业。如果您选择不在区块链行业发展职业，您总是可以进行教学，这是赚钱的绝佳方式。目前，只有0.5%的人口在使用它。如果您今天开始学习它，到它获得更多关注时，您将站在其发展的最前沿。对于区块链的需求几乎增长了2000%，成为了科技行业最受追捧的技能之一。据估计，到2024年，区块链市场的净价值将达到200亿美元。目前，大量银行正在实施区块链技术，以提高其服务质量并加强其安全性。拥有开放职位最多的城市是纽约、旧金山和圣何塞，截至2022年，区块链开发人员的中位工资为154,550美元。随着技术的改进和进步，这个领域一直有增长的空间。您应该成为区块链开发人员，因为：●
    对区块链开发人员的需求远远超过供应。这意味着工作市场还没有饱和，而且可能在很长一段时间内也不会饱和。● 目前，这个领域的薪水在科技领域中是最具竞争力之一。只要有足够的动力和经验，您可能每年赚得高达20万美元。●
    您有机会参与改革金融市场运作方式。初学者的逐步指南
