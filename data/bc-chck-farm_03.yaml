    distant. I’m in the city visiting my aunt and uncle, enjoying the swimming pool
    in their luxury apartment complex and loading up on imported Australian trail
    mix before I head back to the countryside. Along the balconies of people’s high-rise
    apartments are slabs of meat, tied with string. The slabs sway next to shirts
    and sheets left out to dry. Late autumn means it’s time to make *lap yuk*, preserved
    pork, a southern Chinese specialty. A piece of raw pork belly is soaked in a blend
    of rice wine, salt, soy sauce, and spices, then hung out to cure in the damp,
    cold autumn air. The fat becomes translucent and imparts a savory-sweet taste
    to any stir-fried vegetable dish. A relative of mine explains that only southern
    China can make preserved pork like this. The secret is the native, natural spores
    and bacteria in the wind.

    news source. There is a global pig panic and a pig lockdown in rural China, born
    out of biosecurity and the onset of African swine fever (ASF), a disease in pigs
    that causes hemorrhaging. The fatality rate is close to 100 percent, as pigs bleed
    out to their deaths. Headlines in my news feed declare a world on edge. While
    ASF has been in other countries, such as Russia and Belgium, this is the first
    time the fever has been reported in China, the world’s largest pork producer.
    The looming impacts are an unpleasant prospect for economists and politicians.
    Less pork available means higher food prices, and higher food prices means public
    discontent. Historical lessons abound: bread riots have been catalysts for the
    demise of empires, from the French Revolution to the Russian February Revolution.

    in China as far back as 7000 B.C.E., and a 1929 anthropological survey showed
    that 70 percent of animal calorie intake in China was from pork. Within traditional
    Chinese medicine, food itself is medicine, and is crucial to the prevention of
    disease. Pork nourishes the blood and strengthens qi, the vital life force that
    flows through all living beings. Dishes are expected to be a balance of all five
    flavors, for medicinal benefit—sweet, salty, bitter, spicy, sour. Mao Zedong’s
    favorite dish, red braised pork, adheres to this flavor criteria, with the addition
    of extra chilies that signal the spiciness and revolutionary zeal of Mao’s native

- en: While pork was once an occasional luxury, incomes and pork consumption are rising
    across China. This increased appetite is shifting geopolitical alliances and global
    trade. In 2013, the Henan Province–based WH Group bought the American pork producer
    Smithfield, making the WH Group the largest pork producer in the world. It expanded
    WH Group’s operations to a vast network of family farms and industrial operations
    outside of China. These industrial pig farms are an environmental headache for
    the communities that live around them, including states like North Carolina, which
    has launched legislative campaigns against Smithfield. In 2005, Brazil’s minister
    of foreign relations remarked on the rosy Brazil-China relationship as being part
    of the “reconfiguration of the world’s commercial and diplomatic geography.” Brazil
    is poised to be the world’s leader in soybean exports as swaths of the Amazon

    The threat isn’t just to China’s pork supply but also to the world’s. China exports

    one of the many midsize pork farms with fewer than a hundred pigs. Ninety-eight
    percent of the pork farms in China have fewer than fifty animals, and these small
    to midsize farms account for about a third of pork production in China. These
    highly decentralized farms make government oversight difficult. There is also
    enormous pressure for these farms to keep up with the market price for pork, and
    to maintain steady production. The government was finding ASF a convenient excuse
    to eradicate these small farms, making way for centralized, industrial-scale operations.

    industrial pig farming, there is little contact between humans and pigs, and the
    pigs remain behind closed doors, viewable only on closed-circuit TV. Pigs have
    a fragile constitution. One pig farmer told me that pigs can get stressed and
    sick just from a minor change in their drinking water. Even under the best circumstances,
    without the threat of ASF, an industrial pig farm is more like an iPhone factory
    than a bucolic countryside haven. Each herd is watched and monitored on-screen

    and degree of precision possible in software—a level of control over every microscopic
    variable along the way, such as pig stress levels. Weiyang’s entire approach is
    crudely transparent—food, like engineers, can be a pipeline and sourcing issue,
    solved through increased vertical integration. NetEase has set up numerous massive
    online open courses (MOOCs) to create a population of skilled workers for recruiting
    directly into their company, addressing the existing shortage of skilled high-tech

    from producing one hundred pigs to a hundred thousand means requiring parts to
    be the same size and type, interchangeable. Before the advent of industrial agriculture

    to slippery usages, to being malleable to any kind of political or economic end.
    AI is technically a subset of machine learning. And within artificial intelligence,
    one of the most exciting areas over the past ten years has been work done on neural
    networks, which are used in deep learning. These artificial neural networks rely
    on models of the brain that have been formalized into mathematical operations.
    Research into these “artificial neurons” began as early as 1943, with a paper
    by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts on the perceptron, an algorithm that modeled
    binary (yes/no) classification, which would serve as the foundation of contemporary
    neural networks.

    research on how our brains function and process information. And the way brains

    neuroscientist I spoke to, Ashok Litwin-Kumar, explained that studies and experiments
    on animal brains are still being done in order to understand more complex, generative
    brain functions—like constructing new meanings and relationships, or interpreting
    new experiences. Neurons can be artificially “created” and modeled on a computer,
    but we still do not know how to regenerate human neurons once they die off. While
    artificial neural networks often assume there are only a few types of neurons,
    human neural networks consist of thousands of different types scattered across
    the body, existing even in places like the stomach. Just replicating a single
    brain using computer neural networks doesn’t guarantee an exact mimicking of brain
    function. After all, the process of learning doesn’t reside solely within our

    该项目忽略了世界各地的小农户农民的真正工作。 数千年来，这些农民的工作一直是在管理和保护大地，而不是优化农业生产。 他们采用的实践方法产生了营养丰富的食物，为健康的土壤和不确定未来的丰富生态奠定了基础。
    他们的工作来源于承诺和责任：对他们的社区，对当地生态，对大地。 与机器不同，这些农民接受他们与土地的行为负责。 他们承诺走向不确定的道路。
- en: After all, life is defined not by uncertainty itself but by a commitment to
    living despite it. In a time of economic and technological anxiety, the questions
    we ask cannot center on the inevitability of a closed system built by AI, and
    how to simply make those closed systems more rational or “fair.” What we face
    are the more difficult questions about the meaning of work, and the ways we commit,
    communicate, and exist in relation to each other. Answering these questions means
    looking beyond the rhetoric sold to us by tech companies. What we stand to gain
    is nothing short of true pleasure, a recognition that we are not isolated individuals,
    floating in a closed world.

  zh: 毕竟，生活的定义不仅仅是由于不确定性本身，而是因为对尽管有不确定性而承诺生活。 在经济和技术焦虑的时代，我们提出的问题不能集中在由人工智能构造的封闭系统的不可避免性，以及如何简单地使这些封闭系统更加理性或“公平”。我们所面对的更困难的问题是关于工作意义以及我们在彼此之间的承诺、沟通和存在方式。
    回答这些问题意味着要超越科技公司向我们推销的言辞。我们可能获得的不仅仅是真正的快乐，而是一种认识到我们并不是孤立的个体，而是漂浮在一个封闭世界中的人。
- en: As the subway gets closer to Shanghai, it weaves past rivers and farmland. More
    and more passengers get on, more and more apartment buildings appear out the window.
    It gets louder, with teenagers in their school uniforms getting on the train,
    watching videos on their phones. An old grandmother holds her grandson’s Totoro
    backpack as he nibbles a wafer. Shan’s stop is coming up. She gives me a big,
    encouraging smile before she walks out of the subway car. “Merry Christmas!” she
    says. “Don’t spend it alone!”

  zh: 当地铁接近上海时，它在河流和农田间穿行。上车的乘客越来越多，窗外出现了越来越多的公寓楼。车厢变得越来越吵闹，穿着校服的青少年上车，在手机上观看视频。一位老奶奶抱着她孙子的龙猫背包，孙子在咬着威化饼干。山的站快到了。她在走出地铁车厢之前给了我一个大大的鼓励微笑。“圣诞快乐！”她说。“不要一个人过节！”
