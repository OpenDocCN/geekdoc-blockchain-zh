    digital and permanent recording of transactions on a ledger, such that the ledger
    is distributed across a network of computers (nodes). This makes the ledger available
    across all the nodes simultaneously, thus ensuring that the information contained
    within the ledger remains unaltered. Blockchain can further be explained via its
    terms: in a simplified form, a “block” is a bundle of information regarding a
    transaction, while a “chain” is the continuous record of various blocks of information,
    hence, creating a ledger that is sustained through the use of mathematical algorithms
    to verify the information to be added to the existing blocks of information in
    a way that ensures the permanence of the block in the chain.'

  zh: 5.2 文献综述
- en: Blockchain’s trustworthy status is complemented by the fact that there are existing
    replicas of the blockchain ledger on various nodes. This ensures that the disconnection
    of a node does not affect the access to the record by other users on the blockchain
    network. Every block in the chain references the preceding block, and this eliminates
    manipulation of the records on the blockchain (Lemieux et al., [2019](#CR15)).
    Blockchains also utilize cryptography in attaining an increased degree of trustworthiness
    of the information in the block. Cryptography  is utilized in uniquely marking
    a transaction consummated on a blockchain system (Zheng et al., [2018](#CR29)).
    It facilitates the immutable linking of various blocks on the chain by combining
    different blocks to create a block hash.^([1](#Fn1))

  zh: 区块链的可信状态得到了加强，因为区块链分类账的副本存在于各种节点上。这确保了节点的断开不会影响其他用户在区块链网络上访问记录。链中的每个区块都引用了前面的区块，这消除了对区块链上记录的篡改（Lemieux等人，[2019](#CR15)）。区块链还利用密码学来提高区块中信息的可信度。密码学被用于在区块链系统上唯一标记完成的交易（Zheng等人，[2018](#CR29)）。它通过将不同的区块组合起来创建区块哈希来实现对链上各个区块的不可变链接。^([1](#Fn1))
- en: There exist varying blockchain systems that are configured differently. Each
    of these blockchain systems exhibits, in different ways, the properties of the
    original conceptualization of blockchain. These changes are usually to accommodate
    application-specific requirements and security concerns around the use of blockchain
    technology. The different blockchain systems are usually distinguished along the
    lines of the level of ownership, access, and operation of the blockchain (Zheng
    et al., [2018](#CR29)). Blockchains can be private or permissioned, public or
    permission-less or consortium blockchain systems.

- en: In private or permissioned blockchain systems  , the technical components of
    the blockchain are controlled by an organization. Essentially, access to the blockchain
    network is controlled by that organization. This is usually the case for companies
    or organizations that adopt a blockchain for internal processes. Some authors
    believe that permissioned blockchain systems are built for specific purposes.
    However, permissioned blockchain system poses certain concerns when considered
    against the general conceptualization of blockchain, which is against any affiliation
    to centralization or a singular verifying authority. It also undermines, to a
    great degree, the immutability of the record on the blockchain as it requires
    less manpower and technical requirements for the blockchain to be manipulated

- en: Consortium blockchains  , as the name suggests, have the technical components
    owned by a consortium or group of organizations. Like private or permissioned
    blockchains, the same concerns exist in a slightly less worrying degree. Public
    or permission-less blockchain systems  accommodate and allow the verification
    of information by any user on the blockchain without the need to obtain permission
    from a central authority, as is the case with private blockchain or consortium

    as originally conceptualized, which refers to a distributed store of information
    that secures records without the necessity for intermediaries or oversight authorities.
    They consider that private blockchains  undermine the original point of blockchain,
    which essentially serves the purpose of removing third parties. Since private
    blockchains, though cheaper, require the need for a centralized authority that
    determines the users with access to verification capacity, it adds minimal value
    to the concept of a trusted integrated database (Jabbari & Kamisky, [2018](#CR11)).

    or verify the truthfulness of a transaction upon receipt of sufficient cryptographic
    proof that the information contained in the inputted data is accurate enhances
    trust, and this invariably makes blockchain a superior and preferred means of

    it appears that the decentralized nature of blockchain and the lack of intermediaries
    (which have become standardized and commonplace in our modern financial and business
    transactions), though exciting and innovating, also carry a large amount of risk.
    Indeed, one wonders whether it is even really possible for it to be truly said
    that there are no “intermediaries” with blockchain-based technologies. Take Bitcoin,
    for instance, which is a continuously growing and exciting digital currency centered

    Ledger, a private company Bitcoin wallet host based in France, was subjected to
    a major hacking incident, which led to the personal information of over 270,000
    users being leaked online. Bambrough refers to these intermediary companies as
    Bitcoin’s “biggest weakness”, and the same may hold for other forms of assets

- en: Apart from general blockchain security and legal risks, there are also issues
    relating specifically to its application in the legal sector. There is the concern
    that smart contracts (which will be discussed later in this chapter in detail)
    are incapable of capturing the finer legal concepts of reasonability and best
    endeavors requirement in execution, and this is without mentioning the obvious
    fact that traditional contracts can easily accommodate amendments to contracts,
    which would readily not be the case with smart contracts that run on codes, which
    make no provision for such amendments (Brown, [2016](#CR4)). While the application
    of blockchain in legal endeavors will occasion some benefits, it cannot wholly
    replace existing legal systems. Werbach suggests that blockchain can be synchronized
    with the law through contractual integration, the application of computational

    blockchain technology is applied. Notwithstanding, Yeung recognizes the limitations
    of technological enforcement of contracts, which precludes individuals from challenging
    an alleged rule violation, thereby eroding the attendant opportunity for the society

    results or outcomes, while applying blockchain technology to guarantee that the
    record of data concerning the contract remains untampered and immutable (Hu et
    al., [2018](#CR9)). This could redefine how contractual relations between parties
    occur – if parties are using smart contracts, the entire transactional arrangement
    could be digitalized and programmed, such that offer, acceptance, payment, etc.
    occur virtually and seamlessly. This has effects on the role of lawyers in such
    transactions, which may shift from physical drafting and review of documents to
    digital analysis of the smart contract to ensure that the virtual process occurs
    without any issues or glitches, as well as understanding the future legal framework

    - 如果各方使用智能合约，整个交易安排可以被数字化并编程，使得要约、接受、支付等几乎无缝地进行。这对律师在此类交易中的角色产生影响，可能从物理起草和审查文件转变为数字分析智能合约，以确保虚拟过程没有任何问题或故障，并理解智能合约发生争议时的未来法律框架。

    on the side of any party to a contract in terms of performance affect the main
    purpose of contracting as a whole, and this is made worse in the event that a
    party or parties need to employ legal mechanisms (such as the court, arbitration,
    etc.) to settle the issues in performance. Blockchain aims to do this through
    its algorithms, which can be coded in such a manner as to automatically detect
    when certain conditions are made. For example, if a condition precedent to the
    consummation of a contract for petroleum products is that the price per barrel
    of oil has to be $40, the smart contract can be coded in such a manner that it
    scans and checks the price per barrel automatically, and once such a price level
    is reached, it executes the contract without need for further input from the parties.

  zh: 此外，某些司法管辖区（包括尼日利亚）不承认数字资产（如加密货币）作为法定货币的地位，进一步加剧了税收难题。数字资产被视为货币还是商品，以至于数字货币的交换（无论是现金、服务还是商品）应被视为收入还是资本收益？这是至关重要的，因为对数字资产交易的不同税收处理将取决于其是否构成个人所得税目的的收入，或者是否构成资本税目的的资本收益或损失（Salmon
    & Meyers，[2019](#CR24)）。
- en: Nigeria  is quite behind other jurisdictions with regard to adequately preparing
    for the taxation of blockchain transactions and the digital economy in general.
    The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), the apex revenue authority in Nigeria,
    is yet to openly make any statement regarding the taxation of the digital economy.
    Different authors have speculated that the Finance Act 2019, which introduced
    the concept of ‘Significant Economic Presence’ to taxation in Nigeria, is an attempt
    to capture the digital economy, but whether this would be successful or not is
    a different matter not covered by the scope of this chapter (Komolafe & Chukwuani,
    [2020](#CR13)). In February 2020, the Minister of Finance issued a Companies Income
    Tax (Significant Economic Presence) Order 2020, which sought to clarify the Significant
    Economic Presence concept. Some commentaries on order indicate that the order
    has raised more questions than it provided solutions. It is hoped that there would
    be clarifications made by the FIRS regarding the questions raised by the order,
    particularly  as it relates to blockchain technologies such as cryptocurrency
    (Abayomi, [2020](#CR1)).

  zh: 就充分准备征税区块链交易和数字经济而言，尼日利亚远远落后于其他司法管辖区。尼日利亚的联邦国内税务局（FIRS）作为最高税收机构，尚未公开就数字经济的征税发表任何声明。不同的作者推测，2019年财政法案引入了“重大经济存在”概念到尼日利亚的税收领域，是对数字经济进行捕捉的尝试，但这是否成功是另一回事，不在本章节的讨论范围之内（Komolafe
    & Chukwuani，[2020](#CR13)）。2020年2月，财政部长颁布了《公司所得税（重大经济存在）令2020》，旨在澄清“重大经济存在”概念。对该令的一些评论表明，该令提出了更多问题而不是提供了解决方案。希望尼日利亚的FIRS能就该令引发的问题进行澄清，尤其是关于诸如加密货币之类的区块链技术（Abayomi，[2020](#CR1)）。

- en: Blockchain technology has an undeniable presence in the world economy. Its ability
    to cross jurisdictions and affect transactions worldwide should galvanize countries
    across the globe to provide necessary laws and regulations that will govern the
    rights and obligations of the users of blockchain technology. In the years to
    come, there will be a development of exiting blockchain structures to accommodate
    some of the issues that will arise from its current application and changes in
    the regulatory regime. While one must recognize that blockchain will continue
    to progress substantially, it is difficult to say whether it would eliminate the
    need for some traditional processes currently adopted in various sectors. One
    of the reasons for this is the challenge with the scalability of blockchain.

  zh: 区块链技术在世界经济中有着不可否认的存在。其跨越司法管辖区并影响全球交易的能力应该激励全球各国提供必要的法律法规，以规范区块链技术的用户的权利和义务。未来几年，将会发展出新的区块链结构，以适应其当前应用中出现的一些问题以及监管体制的变化。虽然必须承认区块链将继续大幅发展，但很难说它是否会消除目前各个行业采用的一些传统流程的需求之一的原因是区块链的可扩展性挑战。
- en: Blockchain technology displays potential for revolutionizing various sectors
    and activities, but the technical challenge of scalability poses a threat to its
    many potentials. Currently, the block size limit of bitcoin is one megabyte, and
    it is estimated that the transaction processing capacity of 7 transactions in
    a second (Zheng et al., [2018](#CR29)). The scalability concern is reduced in
    a permissioned blockchain as the data are stored on every computer in the network,
    and all nodes verify all transactions. However, when the nodes and users with
    access to the blockchain system increase, the users with access to verification
    will substantially reduce and will lead to an increased form on centralization.
    Given that permissioned blockchain systems require only a few predetermined users
    for verification, there would be a greater chance of scalability to match the
    processing demands caused by the increase in transactions (Peters & Panayi, [2015](#CR22)).

  zh: 区块链技术显示出颠覆各个领域和活动的潜力，但可扩展性的技术挑战对其许多潜力构成了威胁。目前，比特币的区块大小限制为一兆字节，估计每秒的交易处理能力为 7
    笔（Zheng 等，[2018](#CR29)）。在许可的区块链中，可扩展性问题得到了缓解，因为数据存储在网络中的每台计算机上，并且所有节点验证所有交易。然而，当节点和访问区块链系统的用户增加时，能够进行验证的用户将大幅减少，并且会导致集中化的增加形式。考虑到许可的区块链系统仅需要少数预定用户进行验证，因此有更大的可能性使可扩展性与交易量增加造成的处理需求相匹配（Peters
    & Panayi，[2015](#CR22)）。

- en: Notwithstanding the above challenges, the growth and development of blockchain
    technology should be encouraged, especially by developing economies. This is because
    of the potentially substantial economic shift with the attendant changes it may
    bring to financial services and transactions.

  zh: 尽管存在上述挑战，但应该鼓励区块链技术的增长和发展，尤其是发展中国家。这是因为随之可能带来的经济巨大转变以及对金融服务和交易可能带来的变化。
- en: For organizations interested in applying this technology either as a means to
    optimize internal processes or to optimize their services to clients, it is important
    that great consideration is given regarding the nature of the blockchain system
    to adopt, as each is likely to result in different outcomes and requirements.
    Bringing this to the case study, in particular, Nigeria would require a regulatory
    overhaul and a deliberate shift toward digitalization of various aspects of her
    economy to minimize or avoid the potential risks and challenges that may occur
    in the wake of the changes that may result from the application of blockchain
    technology.

  zh: 对于有意将这项技术应用于优化内部流程或将其服务优化给客户的组织来说，重要的是要充分考虑采用的区块链系统的性质，因为每种系统可能会产生不同的结果和要求。特别是对于案例研究，尼日利亚需要进行一次监管改革，并有意向数字化其经济的各个方面，以最小化或避免可能会随着区块链技术应用带来的变化而产生的潜在风险和挑战。
- en: Nigeria may consider following the path of Japan, which has become the first
    country to undertake the legalization of cryptocurrencies. Amendments to Nigeria’s
    existing body of laws may be necessary as well in the event Nigeria chooses to
    explore this option. In this regard, a leaf could be borrowed from Malta, given
    that it was the first country to take regulatory steps with respect to blockchain
    technology, and some lessons may be learned from their experience thus far. In
    doing any of the foregoing, caution must, however, be applied, and extensive consultation
    of all stakeholders in governments and the financial sector would be necessary.
    Unless the issues discussed (and many others not discussed in this chapter) are
    addressed, any hasty regulation made in Nigeria will join the annals of forward-looking
    legislation without considering its practicability and enforcement.

  zh: 尼日利亚可以考虑效仿日本的做法，后者已成为首个进行加密货币合法化的国家。如果尼日利亚选择探索这一选择，可能需要对尼日利亚现有的法律体系进行修正。在这方面，可以借鉴马耳他的经验，因为它是首个在区块链技术方面采取监管措施的国家，从他们迄今为止的经验中可以吸取一些教训。然而，在进行任何上述行动时，必须谨慎行事，并且需要对政府和金融部门的所有利益相关者进行广泛磋商。除非讨论的问题（以及本章未讨论的许多其他问题）得到解决，否则尼日利亚制定的任何仓促法规都将成为考虑其可行性和执行性的前瞻性立法的史册。
