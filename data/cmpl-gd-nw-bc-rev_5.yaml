    a verification mechanism for both transactions and asset ownership. A single copy
    of the transactions is stored in a shared, distributed, ledger that is replicated
    across the network, so each member has the exact same accurate copy of the transaction
    activity in near real-time. The unique benefits that accrue from a Blockchain
    are:'

  zh: 区块链创建了一个包括所有参与者的网络，并为交易和资产所有权提供验证机制。交易的单个副本存储在一个共享的、分布式的账本中，该账本在整个网络中复制，因此每个成员都能在近实时获得交易活动的完全相同的准确副本。区块链带来的独特优势包括：

    by a trusted third party). There is a whole chapter of the book dedicated to this
    topic.

  zh: 区块链的类型
- en: 'There are two main types of Blockchains: Public (open) and private (closed).
    Let’s first take a look at the characteristics of a public Blockchain. Most likely,
    you have heard of Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum. Both of these and several others
    in the marketplace today operate using public Blockchains.'

  zh: 区块链主要有两种类型：公共（开放）和私人（封闭）。首先让我们看看公共区块链的特点。很可能，你已经听说过比特币，也许还有以太坊。这两种以及市场上今天的其他许多产品都使用公共区块链。
- en: '**Public blockchains** are permission-zero distributed ledgers. That means
    that ANYONE can join the network and you don’t have to be asked nor do you need
    permission to join the network. Public Blockchains are anonymous so members don’t
    have to reveal who they are to participate.'

  zh: '**公共区块链**是权限零分布式账本。这意味着任何人都可以加入网络，你不需要被邀请，也不需要获得加入网络的许可。公共区块链是匿名的，因此成员无需透露自己的身份即可参与。'
- en: Open blockchains also have anonymous validation which means that anyone can
    participate in the Consensusprocess that validates transactions. This opens the
    door for potential bad guys to try and tamper with the data in a Blockchain. This
    topic will be covered extensively later on.

  zh: 开放的区块链还具有匿名验证，这意味着任何人都可以参与验证交易的共识过程。这为潜在的坏人尝试篡改区块链中的数据敞开了大门。这个话题将在后面详细介绍。
- en: As you’ve seen in advantages mentioned above, public blockchains are trustless
    systems*.* Trust is not a prerequisite for doing business on the network. You
    do not have to know, or like, or trust the other party in a transaction on a public
    Blockchain. And, these blockchains are where “Brave New World” apps are being
    developed. In other words, applications on a public Blockchain are those that
    didn’t exist or couldn’t have existed before Blockchains but are now being developed
    - like cryptocurrencies.

  zh: 正如你在上面提到的优势中所看到的，公共区块链是无需信任的系统。在网络上的交易不需要信任。你不需要知道、喜欢或信任公共区块链上的交易对方。而且，这些区块链是正在开发“勇敢的新世界”应用程序的地方。换句话说，公共区块链上的应用程序是在区块链出现之前不存在或无法存在的，但现在正在开发，比如加密货币。

  zh: 私人区块链
- en: Now let’s contrast public Blockchains with private Blockchains. There are several
    private Blockchains that are available on the marketplace. HyperLedger, which
    has big backing by IBM, and Ripple which focuses on high transaction throughput
    in the financial markets are two of the most well-known private Blockchains.

  zh: 现在让我们来对比一下公有区块链与私有区块链。市场上有一些可用的私有区块链，其中比较知名的有IBM大力支持的HyperLedger和专注于金融市场高交易吞吐量
    的Ripple。
- en: The first distinctive quality of a private Blockchain is that, it is based on
    a permissioned private ledger. Who can participate in the network and who can
    validate transactions is known and vetted in advance. Participants must have a
    level of trust within the network and be invited to join the network.

  zh: 私有区块链的第一个独特特性是，它基于一个授权的私有账本。谁可以参与网络以及谁可以验证交易是已知并提前审核的。参与者必须在网络内拥有一定的信任度并受邀加入网络。
- en: Since private Blockchains usually have large corporations as participants, sensitive
    data will often be stored “off the chain” while consensus and validation information
    will be store inside the blockchain. For example, the fact that two companies
    agreed on a contract can be validated inside of the Blockchain, while the actual
    terms of the contract might be stored “off chain” in a relational database. Private
    Blockchains are the choice for “reconstructing existing world applications” where
    old applications get a facelift with Blockchain technology to gain the processing
    efficiencies that were discussed earlier.

  zh: 由于私有区块链通常有大公司作为参与者，敏感数据经常会以“链下”形式存储，而共识和验证信息则存储在区块链内部。例如，两家公司同意合同的事实可以在区块链内进行验证，而合同的实际条款可能会在关系型数据库中以“链下”形式存储。私有区块链是“重构现有世界应用”的选择，通过区块链技术给旧应用带来焕然一新的面貌，以获得前面提到的处理效率。
