- en: 'Chapter 1: Blockchain and CryptocurrencyBlockchain at Its InceptionThe concept
    behind ‘Blockchain’ technology was first outlined in 1991 by research scientists
    Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They proposed a computationally practical
    method that added time stamps to digital documents, so that they could not be
    backdated or altered. The system was to use an encrypted chain of blocks to store
    the time-stamped documents. In 1992, Merkle trees were included in the design.
    A Merkle tree is a structure used by computer applications to organize data. This
    made it possible for multiple documents to be collected and stored in one block.
    After its development, the technology was not used and the patent ended up lapsing
    in 2004.In that same year, a computer scientist named Harold Finney launched a
    system called RPoW or Reusable Proof of Work. The system worked by collecting
    non-exchangeable Hashcash based Proof of work tokens and then generating an RSA.
    It is a signed token that could be passed on from person to person. Hashcash is
    a proof-of-work model and RSA is a technique used to encrypt a public-key used
    for secure data transmission especially over the internet. When you are spending
    tangible money, it’s hard to spend the same coin or note twice, because the transaction
    is happening in the presence of one or more people. Double spending was a term
    coined after the rise of bitcoin, it describes the possibility of spending the
    same unit of cryptocurrency more than once. RPoW solved this problem by keeping
    records of the ownership of tokens and registering them on a server that allowed
    users to validate their authenticity immediately.In 2008, a Whitepaper was posted
    to a cryptography mailing list by someone, or a group of people, using the pseudonym
    Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper presented a decentralized, peer-to-peer, electronic
    cash system based on the Hashcash POW algorithm, called Bitcoin. (Binance Academy,
    2018). It proposed the use of a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that could
    trail and validate any and all transactions.On the 3rd of January 2009, the first
    Bitcoin block was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. It yielded him a reward of 50 Bitcoins.
    The first ever Bitcoin transaction took place on the 12th of January when Nakamoto
    sent Harold Finney 10 Bitcoins.Blockchain TodayIn 2013, a programmer named Vitalik
    Buterin expressed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for building decentralized
    applications. He then started developing a new Blockchain-based distributed computing
    system called Ethereum. A distributed computing system has numerous pieces of
    software on several computers but run as one system. The computers in the system
    can either be in close proximity to each other sharing a local network, or they
    can be dispersed in different areas and connected by a Wide-area network. Ethereum
    has a scripting feature called Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are scripts that
    are implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain. They can be used to make transactions
    if specific conditions are met. They are written in specific coding languages
    and arranged into Bytecode. Bytecode is source code that has been simplified for
    a software interpreter to understand. The Ethereum Virtual machine then reads
    and executes the transactions. The EVM is often called a virtual CPU because it
    is not tangible and is run on hundreds of machines worldwide.Developers can produce
    apps that run inside the Ethereum Blockchain. These apps are called DApps (Decentralized
    Applications). There are hundreds of apps running on the Ethereum blockchain,
    including various social media platforms. Blockchain technology is becoming more
    conventional and is even used in applications outside of the cryptocurrency space.How
    Does a Blockchain Work?Blockchain is an apt name for this system. Like the name
    states, a blockchain is a chain of blocks that contain information. It is a distributed
    ledger that is open to anyone. A ledger is a bookkeeping system that contains
    all of a company’s financial data. It records each and every transaction that
    happens from day one. It also contains the account information that company’s
    use to prepare their financial statements.Once data has been recorded inside a
    block it is virtually impossible to change. Each block has three components; the
    data, the hash and the previous block’s hash. The data depends on what kind of
    block it is. The hash works the same way a fingerprint does in that it can’t be
    duplicated and you can use it to identify a single block and all it’s content.If
    a piece of data in the block changes, so does the hash. Hashes are useful because
    they help in identifying any changes that have happened within a block. The hash
    of the previous block is what links all the blocks together like a chain. This
    is what makes a blockchain so secure.If we had three blocks in one chain then
    block three would contain block two’s hash and block two would contain block one’s
    hash. The first block only has its own hash so it’s called the Genesis block.In
    the event that the second block is interfered with, its hash will change and that
    would invalidate all the blocks that come afterward because block three would
    not contain a valid hash. While a blockchain is inherently secure, computers are
    developing and increasing their capabilities on a daily basis so it’s not impossible
    for blocks to be interfered with.To abate any interference, blockchains have something
    called Proof of Work (PoW). PoW works to slow down the building of new blocks.
    It’s helpful because if you were to meddle with block two, you would have to do
    the proof of work for every block that comes after it.In order to manage the chain,
    blockchain uses a Peer-to-peer network. A peer-to-peer network is where two or
    more computers are able to share files without having to connect to one server.
    As soon as a new user joins the network they have full access to the entire blockchain
    and all its data. The node is used to verify the data. A node can either be a
    redistribution point, a communication endpoint or a connection point. In a blockchain
    it is a connection point. A node can register information, process it and then
    send it to other nodes.If a new block is added it gets sent to all the computers
    on the network. The node verifies the block and then adds it to the blockchain.
    All the nodes in the network create consensus by agreeing on which blocks are
    valid and which are not. If a block has been interfered with it gets rejected
    by all the nodes in the network.Because blocks are constantly changing, Smart
    Contracts were developed. They are programs that are kept in the blockchain. They
    automatically exchange coins if certain conditions are met.Different Types of
    BlockchainsPrivate BlockchainsAccess to Private blockchains is invitation based.
    Users can be validated by a rule set by the central administrator of the network.
    Only some users can have access to the network and of those few, there are limits
    on the kinds of transactions they can perform. These kinds of blockchains use
    a Proof of Authority consensus approach (PoA). PoA is part of a consensus algorithm
    that gives a small group of users on a blockchain the authority to validate transactions
    on the network. PoA is mostly used within secure business environments to control
    access and record keeping because the transaction data is not usually visible
    to them.Public BlockchainsPublic blockchains are all about engagement and transparency.
    Transaction consensus is not centralized, so anybody can take part in authenticating
    network transactions and the software code is open source. This means it is available
    to the public. Public blockchains are decentralized through crypto-economics to
    promote cooperation throughout a network. There isn’t a sole entity controlling
    the network and there is no central point of failure. The consensus algorithms
    used in a public blockchain are PoW and Proof of Stake (PoS). PoS is an algorithm
    that processes transactions and creates new blocks in a chain. It is used to validate
    any data entries and keep the database secure.Consortium BlockchainsNo one ever
    talks about Consortium blockchains because they are not widely used. They can
    be described as a combination of both public and private blockchains because they
    have a ‘semi-permissioned’ approach. Consortium blockchains’ participants are
    usually known and have been authorized by a central authority to participate in
    the consensus. This kind of blockchain is semi-decentralized while still offering
    some level of control. Transaction data is also kept private. Consortium blockchains
    make use of all three consensus algorithms; PoW, PoS, and PoA.What Is Cryptocurrency?Most
    people know what cryptocurrency is, but not many understand it. Until around ten
    years ago, all forms of modern currency were controlled and regulated by banks
    and governments. This means that the regulatory authority was centralized, and
    that restricted the capabilities of tangible money and credit cards. While modern
    banking has come a long way in recent years, it has its issues. When two parties
    are exchanging money, it’s possible for there to be a single point of failure.
    The bank can have a glitch in the system or one party’s transfer limit could have
    been reached.Cryptocurrency removes all the problems of modern banking because
    there is no single point of failure. A single point of failure happens when a
    vital part of a system ceases to function, thus causing the entire system to fail.
    Crypto is a virtual currency that is used as a medium of exchange. It works in
    a similar way to any other currency, it just isn’t tangible and operates using
    cryptography. Cryptography is a way to protect information using code, so that
    only the relevant parties have access to it.Cryptocurrency Key Features●     Cryptocurrency
    is decentralizedBanks and governments control the economic system in the outside
    world. In the digital realm, there are no third-parties and transactions can be
    processed and authenticated via an open network that doesn’t belong to an entity.●     Cryptocurrency
    is immutableWhen something is immutable, it cannot be changed.●     Cryptocurrency
    is anonymousThere is no need for users to identify themselves when trading cryptocurrency
    because there is no third-party. The network processes, authenticates and documents
    all transactions on the blockchain.●     Cryptocurrency has a finite supplyWhen
    most cryptocurrency is created, it has a predetermined amount to be mined out
    of the system. Other digital currencies may not have an actual limit, but they
    do control the amount of new coins that can be generated on a yearly basis.●     Transactions
    are irreversibleBecause there is no management by any central authority, there
    isn’t a body or an organization that can intervene when any kind of mistake is
    made. So if you were making a transaction and you happened to enter the wrong
    details and it gets sent through, it cannot be reversed and there is no organization
    that you can reach out to for support.Characteristics of a Good Cryptocurrency●     SecurityAnybody
    who has assets they can’t actually touch wants to be sure that they are safe at
    all times. Cryptocurrencies stay in a digital ‘wallet’. A wallet is essentially
    just a long line of letters and numbers. It can also be called a private key and
    it allows its owner to withdraw coins. There is a shorter line of numbers linked
    to the private key that allows a user to accept deposits. This number is called
    a public key. When two wallets share a transaction, that data is entered into
    a block which is then added to a ledger. Once all of this information reaches
    the ledger it cannot be changed.●     ScalabilityWhen a cryptocurrency is scalable,
    it means it can confirm a large number of transactions, usually per second. When
    trading cryptocurrency, a user wants to know that all transactions are going to
    happen fairly quickly and without fail. Because of innovations in technology there
    are apps that offer speedy transactions of normal money like Paypal. This means
    that cryptocurrencies need to be processed at a speed of no more than 3 seconds
    at a time.●     UsabilityLike most things, cryptocurrency needs to be easy to
    navigate. It can be daunting for a new user or for somebody who is considered
    a technophobe. A well developed cryptocurrency has a lot of complicated things
    going on in the background but should always appear to be easy on the user’s end.
    Also, it is always best to use cryptocurrencies that you can transact with via
    a mobile app and not on a web page.●     DemandThe more demand there is for any
    given cryptocurrency, the more valuable it becomes. When there is enough interest
    in the market and the price of a certain coin rises, it will be beneficial to
    users.●     Finite supplyMost, if not all cryptocurrencies have a limited amount
    of coins in existence. The number of coins available is determined upon inception
    and was calculated by mathematics. Some cryptocurrencies release all their coins
    at once and others release them bit by bit in an attempt to keep the price stable.
    In the long run, a good cryptocurrency is determined by its adherence to good
    economic practices.'

  zh: 第1章：区块链和加密货币区块链概述“区块链”技术的概念最早由研究科学家斯图尔特·哈伯和W·斯科特·斯托内塔于1991年提出。他们提出了一种实用的计算方法，可以向数字文档添加时间戳，以防止其被回溯或篡改。该系统利用加密区块链存储时间戳文档。在1992年，默克尔树被纳入了设计中。默克尔树是计算机应用程序用来组织数据的一种结构。这使得多个文档可以被收集并存储在一个区块中。在开发后，该技术未被使用，专利在2004年到期。同年，计算机科学家哈罗德·芬尼推出了一个名为RPoW或可重复使用工作证明的系统。该系统通过收集不可交换的基于Hashcash的工作证明代币，然后生成RSA。这是一种签名的令牌，可以从一个人传递给另一个人。Hashcash是一种工作证明模型，RSA是一种用于加密公钥以进行安全数据传输的技术。当你使用有形货币进行交易时，很难花同一枚硬币或纸币两次，因为交易是在一个或多个人的监督下进行的。比特币兴起后，双重支付这个术语被创造出来，它描述了对同一单位加密货币进行多次支付的可能性。
    RPoW通过记录代币的所有权并在允许用户立即验证其真实性的服务器上注册它们来解决了这个问题。2008年，通过使用化名**中本聪**，有人或一群人在密码学邮件列表上发布了一份白皮书。白皮书提出了基于Hashcash
    POW算法的比特币的去中心化、点对点的电子现金系统。它提出了使用去中心化的点对点协议，来跟踪和验证任何和所有的交易。2009年1月3日，中本聪挖出了第一个比特币区块，获得了50个比特币的奖励。第一笔比特币交易发生在1月12日，当时中本聪向哈罗德·芬尼发送了10个比特币。今天的区块链2013年，一名名叫维塔利克·布特林的程序员表示，比特币需要一种用于构建去中心化应用程序的脚本语言。然后，他开始开发一种名为以太坊（Ethereum）的基于区块链的分布式计算系统。分布式计算系统有多个软件部署在几台计算机上，但作为一个系统运行。系统中的计算机可以或者接近彼此共享一个本地网络，或者分散在不同的区域，并通过广域网连接在一起。以太坊具有称为智能合约的脚本功能。智能合约是在以太坊区块链上执行的脚本。它们可以用于在满足特定条件时进行交易。它们是用特定的编程语言编写并编排成字节码。字节码是已简化以供软件解释器理解的源代码。然后以太坊虚拟机读取并执行交易。EVM经常被称为虚拟CPU，因为它是无形的，并在全球数百台计算机上运行。开发人员可以创建在以太坊区块链中运行的应用程序。这些应用程序称为DApps（去中心化应用程序）。在以太坊区块链上运行着数百种应用程序，包括各种社交媒体平台。区块链技术变得越来越常规，甚至被用于加密货币领域之外的应用。区块链是如何工作的？区块链对于这个系统来说是一个合适的名称。与名称所指的一样，区块链是包含信息的一系列区块。它是一个对任何人都是开放的分布式分类帐。分类帐是一个包含公司所有财务数据的簿记系统。它记录了从第一天开始发生的每一笔交易。它还包含公司用于准备财务报表的账户信息。一旦数据被记录到一个区块中，几乎不可能改变。每个区块都有三个组成部分：数据、哈希和上一个区块的哈希。数据取决于它是什么样的区块。哈希的工作方式类似于指纹，因为它不能被复制，并且你可以用它来识别单个区块及其所有内容。如果区块中的数据发生了变化，哈希也会发生变化。哈希非常有用，因为它有助于识别区块内发生的任何变化。上一个区块的哈希是将所有区块连接在一起的东西，就像一个链条。这就是使区块链如此安全的原因。如果我们在一个链中有三个区块，那么第三个区块将包含第二个区块的哈希，而第二个区块将包含第一个区块的哈希。第一个区块只有自己的哈希，所以它被称为创世区块。如果第二个区块被干扰，它的哈希将改变，并且会使随后的所有区块失效，因为第三个区块将不包含有效的哈希。尽管区块链本身是安全的，但计算机每天都在发展和增强它们的功能，因此区块仍然可能被干扰。为了减轻任何干扰，区块链有一种称为工作证明（PoW）的机制。
    PoW的作用是减缓新区块的生成。这对帮助是有用的，因为如果你要干涉第二个区块，你将不得不为其后的每个区块做工作证明。为了管理链，区块链使用了点对点网络。点对点网络是指两台或多台计算机可以共享文件而无需连接到一个服务器。一旦新用户加入网络，他们就可以完全访问整个区块链及其所有数据。节点用于验证数据。节点可以是重新分发点、通信端点或连接点。在区块链中，它是一个连接点。节点可以注册信息、处理信息，然后将信息发送到其他节点。如果添加了新的区块，它会被发送到网络上的所有计算机。节点验证区块，然后将其添加到区块链中。网络中的所有节点通过同意确定哪些区块是有效的，哪些是无效的。如果一个区块被干扰，所有节点都会拒绝它。由于区块不断变化，所以开发了智能合约。它们是保留在区块链中的程序。如果满足特定条件，它们可以自动交换硬币。不同类型的区块链私有区块链可通过邀请进行访问。用户可以通过网络的中央管理者规则得到验证。只有少数用户可以访问网络，而在这些用户中，对他们可以执行的交易种类有限制。这些区块链使用授权证明共识方法（PoA）。PoA是共识算法的一部分，它为区块链上的一小组用户授权验证交易。PoA主要用于安全的商业环境中控制访问和记录，因为其交易数据通常对他们不可见。公共区块链公共区块链注重参与和透明度。交易共识是分散的，因此任何人都可以参与验证网络交易，而且软件代码是开源的。这意味着它向公众开放。公共区块链通过加密经济学来推动网络合作。没有一个单一实体控制网络，也没有中心化的故障点。公共区块链中使用的共识算法是PoW和股权证明（PoS）。PoS是一种算法，用于处理交易并在链中创建新的区块。它用于验证任何数据条目并保持数据库安全。财团区块链人们很少谈论财团区块链，因为它们并不广泛使用。它们可以被描述为公共和私有区块链的结合，因为它们采取‘半允许’的方式。财团区块链的参与者通常是已知的，并且已经获得了中央管理机构的授权来参与共识。这种区块链是半去中心化的，同时也提供了某种程度的控制。交易数据也是保密的。财团区块链使用了PoW、PoS和PoA的所有三种共识算法。什么是加密货币？大多数人知道什么是加密货币，但很少人了解它。直到大约十年前，所有现代货币都由银行和政府控制和监管。这意味着监管权是集中化的，并且限制了有形货币和信用卡的功能。尽管现代银行业近年来取得了长足的进步，但它也存在问题。在两个当事方进行金钱交易时，可能会出现单点故障。银行可能出现系统故障，或者一方的转账限额可能已达到。加密货币消除了现代银行的所有问题，因为没有单点故障。单点故障是指系统的重要部分停止工作，导致整个系统失败。加密货币是一种虚拟货币，作为交换媒介。它的工作方式与任何其他货币类似，只是它是虚拟的，通过使用密码学操作。密码学是一种用代码保护信息的方法，以便只有相关方才能访问。加密货币的特点●      加密货币是分散的在现实世界中，银行和政府控制经济系统。在数字领域中，没有第三方，交易可以通过不属于任何实体的开放网络进行处理和验证。●      加密货币是不可改变的当某些东西是不可改变的时候，它是无法改变的。●      加密货币是匿名的用户在交易加密货币时无需进行身份验证，因为没有第三方。网络处理、验证并记录所有交易。●      加密货币有限的供应大多数加密货币在创建时就确定了一定数量的硬币从系统中挖出。其他数字货币可能没有实际的极限，但它们确实控制了每年可以生成的新币量。●      交易是不可逆转的由于没有任何中央管理机构，所以当发生任何错误时，不会有组织可以干预。因此，如果你进行了交易，并且不小心输入了错误的详细信息并将其发送，它将不会被撤销，你也没有组织可以寻求支持。良好加密货币的特征●      安全性任何拥有无形资产的人都希望确保它们在任何时候是安全的。加密货币保存在一个数字“钱包”中。钱包实际上只是一长串字母和数字。它也可以称为私钥，使其所有者能够提取货币。与私钥相连的一串更短的数字允许用户接受存款。这个数字称为公钥。当两个钱包共享一笔交易时，该数据记录在一个区块中，然后添加到分类帐中。一旦所有这些信息到达分类帐，它就无法更改了。●      可扩展性当一种加密货币可扩展时，意味着它可以确认大量交易，通常是每秒。当交易加密货币时，用户希望所有交易都会很快无误地进行。由于技术创新，现在有应用程序提供普通货币快速交易，如Paypal。这意味着加密货币需要以不超过3秒的速度进行处理。●      可用性与大多数事物一样，加密货币需要易于使用。对于新用户或被视为技术畏难者来说，可能会感到畏难。一个良好开发的加密货币在后台有很多复杂的东西，但在用户端始终看起来容易。此外，最好使用可以通过移动应用程序进行交易而不是在网页上进行交易的加密货币。●      需求对于任何给定的加密货币的需求越大，它就会变得越有价值。当市场中对某种货币出现足够的兴趣，其价格上涨，对用户有利。●      有限供应大多数，如果不是所有的加密货币在创立之初就确定了有限数量的硬币，这是通过数学计算得出的。一些加密货币一次释放所有硬币，而其他一些则按照比特币数量逐渐释放这些硬币，以维持价格稳定。从长远来看，一个好的加密货币是由其对良好经济实践的遵循来决定的。
