    we have effectively created verifiable identities that third parties can access
    to confirm such claims—hence the growing use of SSO (single sign-on) systems for
    accessing other Web sites. How many of these new “IDs” do these tech giants manage?
    Well, Facebook’s subscribers now exceed 2 billion and Google’s are at 1.2 billion

    bitcoin address (essentially, their public key) with their private key to prove
    that they control it, an institution certifying a person’s attributes can give
    authority to that certification with this same digital signatures model. This

    delivered attribute proofs. In a report entitled “A Blueprint for Digital Identity,”
    the authors noted that identity as it’s understood can be broken up into three
    types of attributes. Inherent attributes are intrinsic to the individual and tend
    to be static, including features such as age, height, fingerprints, or date of
    birth. Accumulated attributes tend to change over time and can include things
    like health records and shopping preferences developed via online shopping activity.
    Assigned attributes are conferred on the user by an outside entity with some degree
    of authority and can include a passport number from a government or an e-mail
    address from a Webmail provider.

- en: Another zero-knowledge approach with great potential is that of homomorphic
    encryption, which allows computers to figure out some useful information by running
    computation on a combined pool of data without knowing the details of its components.
    One simplified example of how to understand the concept involves a group of employees
    who don’t want to divulge their individual salaries. How can they find out the
    total salary pool and average pay per employee of the group? Well, the first person
    comes up with a random number, adds their salary to that number, then secretly
    shares the sum of the two to the next person, who adds their salary to that amount
    and secretly shares the new sum to the next person, and so on. At the end of the
    sequence, the total amount is communicated to the person who started the process,
    who then deducts the secret starting number to figure out the total salary and
    average per person—conducting a rudimentary, human computation. These fundamental
    mathematical constructs are now baked into far more complex cryptographic software
    programs that allow computer scientists to do all sorts of amazing things with
    information that needs to be kept secret. And because computers reduce all data—whether
    it’s a piece of text, a photograph, a GPS coordinate, or a value such as a salary—to
    some numerical representation, these techniques could be used to provide protection

    says. What we should be doing, instead of acting as judge and executioner and
    making assumptions “that past behavior will give me some insight into future behavior,”
    Antonopoulos argues, is building systems that better manage default risk within
    lenders’ portfolios. Bitcoin, he sustains, has the tools to do so. There’s a lot
    of power in this technology to protect against risk: smart contracts, multi-signature
    controls that ensure that neither of two parties can run off with the funds without
    the other also signing a transaction, automated escrow arrangements, and, more
    broadly, the superior transparency and granularity of information on the public
    ledger. In other words, investors already have the tools to protect against the
    risk of loss; who cares about the identity, past behavior, and reputation of the
    people we are transacting with?'

  zh: 有影响力的加密货币思想家安德烈亚斯·安东诺普洛斯认为，问题在于试图解决身份问题，他说这违背了比特币开放、无许可的架构所代表的原则。他认为，构建这些身份/声誉工具的区块链开发人员正在推广“传统金融体系的遗物”。他说，过时的金融机构如银行需要声誉来发挥作用，作为“识别特定身份的违约风险”的代理人，因为它们无法安全地管理该风险。安东诺普洛斯认为，我们应该做的是，而不是充当法官和刽子手，并假设“过去的行为将给我一些关于未来行为的见解”，是构建更好地管理借款人投资组合内违约风险的系统。他坚持认为，比特币有这样的工具。这项技术有很大的威力来保护风险：智能合约、多签名控制，确保没有一方能够带着资金跑掉而不需要另一方也签署交易、自动托管安排，以及更广泛地说，公共账本上信息的更高透明度和细化程度。换句话说，投资者已经拥有了保护损失风险的工具；我们在与之交易的人的身份、过去行为和声誉有什么关系呢？

- en: If an attestation of identifying information is locked into an immutable blockchain

    bona fides on Blockcerts, an MIT Media Lab–initiated open-source code for notarizing
    university transcripts that hashes those documents to the bitcoin blockchain.

    A permissioned blockchain would fall short of the ideal because there, too, the
    central authority controlling the network could always override the private keys
    of the individual and could revoke their educational certificates. A permissionless
    blockchain is the only way to give real control/ownership of the document to the
    graduate, so that he/she can disclose this particularly important attribute at
