    era, the sluggish pace, high cost, and opacity of international funds transfers,
    both corporate and consumer, are a source of frustration. Money seems to hang
    in limbo between institutions for days. Clearing a check from France to the United

    Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network. Most banks will not respond

    funds are on deposit and available through the central banks of those countries
    with the currencies involved on the date that the transaction settles. On that
    settlement date when both central bank clearing systems are up and running, an
    inter-central bank clearing system known as CLS, an acronym originally for continuously

- en: If the banks involved do not have accounts at CLS, then they typically must
    go through banks that do. To those outside the system, it is about the movement
    of money. To those inside, it is the movement of debits and credits, with historical
    audit trails as secured and trusted records, through many dual-entry accounting
    systems. In truth, it is simply the movement of trusted and regulated bits. Yes,
    it is just bits.

- en: The counterparties must trust (and accept the risk) of the banks at both ends,
    the clearing systems of the currencies in their respective countries, the correspondent
    banks, and for coordination CLS. With the possible introduction of DLT, many will
    trust the mathematics proven to secure token movements and their messages over
    the trust in the many institutions (and their costs) to maintain their systems
    properly. Why can those tokens not be dollars or euros? The answer is that they

  zh: CLS 在 2002 年推出，是世界领先的外汇银行拥有的一个系统，用于解决外汇交易中两个交易半部分结算时间的差异。更具体地说，CLS 是一个国际多币种清算系统，旨在确保外汇合同的双方在两个不同国家的清算系统中同时执行，并具有支付的最终性。CLS
    系统通过与 18 个国家央行的账户结算基础外汇交易的支付指令，涉及 18 种货币。那么多国家的那么多银行的计算机之间在那么多时区的技术协调不是一件微不足道的任务。
- en: The CLS system uses SWIFT messages to offer the largest FX cash settlement system
    in the world.²⁴² Each settlement member (typically a bank) holds a single multicurrency
    account with CLS. At the start and end of a normal settlement day, each settlement
    member and each central bank has a zero balance in its account. It is not a “lender
    of last resort.” Settlement members may submit payment instructions relating to
    their own FX transactions as well as the FX transactions of their third-party
    customers directly to CLS. CLS maintains accounts with each of the central banks
    whose currencies settle through CLS. CLS, settlement members, and the national
    RTGS systems of many countries communicate via SWIFT messages.

- en: CLS works by near simultaneously settling through the RTGS systems in the currencies
    and countries at times when both countries’ central bank systems are open to send
    and receive payments. This enables concurrent settlement of the payments on both
    sides of an FX transaction, say, across the Atlantic.²⁴³ If exchanging dollars
    for pounds, the movement of the two currencies (dollars in New York and pounds
    in London) is thus coordinated in the short time window when both systems’ central
    bank clearing systems are concurrently accessible.

    expensive structure.²⁴⁴ The cost of the cure was far more (in historical terms
    at least) than the disease. To the bankers, this timing difference potential problem
    is known as Herstatt risk. In CLS’ defense, during the crash of 2008, it accomplished
    its primary mission of keeping FX markets liquid, when many other markets froze.²⁴⁵
    Without CLS, it is probable that in the 2008 bank crisis, FX payments would have
    been frozen and the Great Recession could have been far worse.

- en: A well-circulated myth is that DLT’s performance problems relate mostly to its
    block size and the current speed of computers. This is not the case. There is
    a common misperception that if we double the speed of a computer, then we halve
    its throughput time. For example, if our computer is running at 20 percent and
    waiting for I/O 80 percent of the time, doubling the speed of the computer will
    give us only a 10 percent increase in throughput (20%/2). Computers of all speeds
    (even quantum computers) wait for I/O at the same speed.

    20% 的速度，并且等待 I/O 占据 80% 的时间，那么将计算机的速度提高一倍只会给我们带来 10% 的增长（20%/2）。所有速度的计算机（甚至是量子计算机）都以相同的速度等待
    I/O。

    waiting for I/O that is the result of latency in the network as they communicate

    asserted (and credible) throughput is orders of magnitude faster than the speed
    of either the Bitcoin or the Ethereum blockchain.

  zh: •历史可能会重演。四十年前，计算机管理的高端人士前往拉斯维加斯的大型计算机展会Comdex。掌握技术预算的人士看到了最新的技术产品。后来，一个规模较小并且最初看似无关紧要的消费电子展览会逐渐壮大，并击败了高端会议。
- en: •The costs and risks of launching a low-risk consumer system are small, and
    once proven with or without regulator or SWIFT’s approval, it may be perceived
    as the safe place for larger and then even larger international transfers. By
    proving itself in the consumer marketplace (without the risks of large-dollar
    interbank payments), it may well grow to become the 800-pound payments gorilla.
    In other words, there is a possibility, if not a probability, that existing institutions
    may be disintermediated by a consumer player.

- en: The question of who will lead this new world order is unclear. Will it be SWIFT,
    R3, Ethereum, central banks, Visa, an existing megatech company like Facebook,
    or a new low-cost DLT-enabled start-up? Given the low costs of entry into this
    trillion-dollar-a-day marketplace, we expect the competition to be ferocious.

  zh: 谁将领导这个新的世界秩序的问题尚不清楚。将是SWIFT、R3、以太坊、中央银行、Visa、像Facebook这样的现有的巨型科技公司，还是一家新的低成本的DLT启用初创公司？考虑到进入这个每天交易额达到数万亿美元的市场的低成本，我们预计竞争将非常激烈。
