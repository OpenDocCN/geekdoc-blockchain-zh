  zh: 摘要
- en: In this paper, we analyze blockchain technology as an alternative to facilitate
    securities market transactions. We argue that the ability to lower transaction
    costs combined with the reduction of intermediaries and improvements in transaction
    efficiency will promote the implementation of blockchain technology in these markets.
    We use platform economics to illustrate how blockchain-based securities exchanges
    can reduce unfair rents that platform operators extract from the investing public
    under the current regulatory regime, and indicate how the economics of platforms
    might be used to implement a blockchain solution to enhance the exchange process.
    We argue that in order to reduce transaction costs and increase the potential
    for innovation, blockchain platforms should be moved from the supply-side to an
    intermediary position and operate as a neutral party that straddles both sides
    of the market. Finally, we find that open routing procedures are likely to positively
    impact the market and enhance the efficiency of securities market transactions.

  zh: 1 引言
- en: Security exchanges based on blockchain technology can offer a viable alternative
    to the currently organized securities markets. In the recent years, blockchain
    technology garnered a lot of attention after it was successfully implemented in
    cryptocurrency markets, most notably with Bitcoin. Only recently, Bitcoin and
    the idea that a cryptocurrency, built on a distributed ledger network, could offer
    the world an alternative to traditional forms of currencies that are controlled
    by central banks was once reserved for “nerds, libertarians and drug dealers”
    [[31](#CR31)]. However, more and more financial markets are adopting the blockchain
    technology and it is only a matter of time when securities exchanges will follow
    the suit. For example, in September 2016, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)
    released a request for consultation paper that communicated their desire to receive
    assistance in analyzing and evaluating their current business requirements and
    potentially transition from their current order processing, clearing, and settlement
    system to a new system that is built on the blockchain technology [[3](#CR3)].
    ASX had begun discussing the implementation of an alternative to the CHESS system,
    which they currently use to process, clear, and settle trades on their exchange,
    at the end of 2017\. ASX plans to have the blockchain system operational by 2023.

  zh: 基于区块链技术的证券交易所可以提供一种可行的替代方案，以取代目前的有组织证券市场。近年来，区块链技术在加密货币市场取得了很多关注，尤其是在比特币成功实施之后。仅在最近，比特币以及建立在分布式账本网络上的加密货币可以为世界提供一种替代传统货币形式的想法，这一想法曾经只属于“书呆子、自由主义者和毒贩”[[31](#CR31)]。然而，越来越多的金融市场正在采用区块链技术，证券交易所也将步其后尘只是时间问题。例如，在2016年9月，澳大利亚证券交易所（ASX）发布了一份咨询文件，表达了他们希望得到协助分析和评估当前业务需求，并可能过渡到一个建立在区块链技术上的新系统的愿望
    [[3](#CR3)]。ASX已经开始讨论在2017年底之前实施一种替代CHESS系统的方案，他们目前使用该系统来处理、清算和结算其交易所的交易。ASX计划在2023年之前使区块链系统投入运行。
- en: To illustrate how blockchain technology can help to facilitate securities transactions,
    one can think about what happens when a transaction is made over a traditional
    securities market. Over traditional financial exchanges, the investor calls a
    broker or inputs an order, the broker routes that order to a specialist or a market
    maker, and the market maker matches a buy and a sell order to complete the transaction.
    After this occurs, the shares and the purchase price associated with those shares
    are exchanged through an intermediary. This process may require the presence of
    multiple intermediaries and may, potentially, suffer from cost and time inefficiencies.
    Fortunately, Bitcoin highlighted how a distributed network ledger system, commonly
    referred to as blockchain technology, could be used to help facilitate market
    transactions without the presence of an intermediary and execute these transactions
    in a more efficient manner (i.e., direct transactions, which are unencumbered
    by an intermediary).

  zh: 要说明区块链技术如何帮助促进证券交易，可以想象一下在传统证券市场上进行交易时会发生什么情况。在传统金融交易所上，投资者致电经纪人或输入订单，经纪人将该订单路由到专家或市场制造商，市场制造商匹配买单和卖单以完成交易。此后，股票和与之相关的购买价格通过中介交换。这个过程可能需要多个中介的存在，并且可能潜在地存在成本和时间效率低下的问题。幸运的是，比特币突出了如何使用分布式网络账本系统，通常被称为区块链技术，来帮助促进市场交易而不需要中介的存在，并以更高效的方式执行这些交易（即，无需中介的直接交易）。
- en: 'Most innovative uses of technology introduce new questions and challenges in
    terms of adoption and we would be remiss if we did not shed light on some of these
    potential issues before highlighting how advances in blockchain-based technologies
    could revolutionize trading in securities markets. According to Chang et al. [[10](#CR10)],
    the primary issues that delay the implementation of a blockchain solution across
    securities markets on a broader scale are the following: (a) Scalability, (b)
    Security, (c) Privacy, and (d) Energy Consumption. Further, Guo and Liang [[22](#CR22)]
    question whether disintermediation is even possible. They contend that some level
    of centralization is likely required to ensure that certain information is safeguarded.
    However, a multi-centered weakly intermediated solution is most likely to prevail.
    So, there are real questions regarding the scalability, security, privacy, and
    the energy consumption associated with the implementation of a blockchain solution,
    but we believe that in time markets will provide novel solutions to these problems
    and it is unlikely that an entirely disintermediated trading solution will arise,
    but movement towards this disintermediated solution will likely reduce costs and
    make markets more efficient.'

  zh: 技术的创新应用往往会在采用方面带来新的问题和挑战，如果我们在强调区块链技术如何彻底改变证券市场交易之前不对其中一些潜在问题进行阐述，那么我们将不尽职。根据Chang等人[[10](#CR10)]的观点，延迟在更广泛的范围内实施区块链解决方案的证券市场的主要问题包括：(a)
    可扩展性，(b) 安全性，(c) 隐私，以及 (d) 能源消耗。此外，Guo和Liang[[22](#CR22)]质疑去中心化是否可能。他们认为，可能需要一定程度的集中化来确保某些信息得到保护。但是，最有可能盛行的是多中心弱中介解决方案。因此，关于实施区块链解决方案的可扩展性、安全性、隐私性和能源消耗存在着真实的问题，但我们认为随着时间的推移，市场将提供新的解决方案来解决这些问题，而且不太可能出现完全去中心化的交易解决方案，但是朝向这一去中心化解决方案的运动可能会降低成本并使市场更加有效率。

- en: According to Geranio [[19](#CR19)], secondary market transactions are likely
    to undergo the most significant transformation due to the introduction of blockchain
    technology that “will allow for a true redesign of current procedures for clearing,
    settlement, and custody, no more anchored to the presence of a central counterparty.”
    The author contends that the secondary market transactions benefit from “a sort
    of natural monopoly granted by available technology and regulation. Blockchain
    could disrupt such monopoly, promoting higher efficiency, shorter duration and
    cost reduction in post-trading processes.” The study claims that the adoption
    of the blockchain technology to process and settle transactions in the secondary
    market could reduce the cost associated with equity analysts by 25%, which is
    estimated to be a 7% decrease in the aggregate transaction costs on the European
    exchanges and bring a 15% reduction of the exchange-related costs in Australia.
    We believe that this significant cost reduction potential of blockchain-based
    exchanges will speed the transition from the traditionally organized exchanges
    to blockchain-based exchanges.

  zh: 根据 Geranio [[19](#CR19)] 的说法，二级市场交易可能会因为区块链技术的引入而发生最重大的转变，这将“允许对当前的结算、交割和托管程序进行真正的重新设计，不再依赖于中央对手方的存在。”
    作者认为，二级市场交易受益于“由可用技术和法规授予的一种天然垄断地位。区块链可能会打破这种垄断，推动后交易流程的更高效率、更短持续时间和成本的降低。” 该研究声称，采用区块链技术来处理和结算二级市场交易可以将与股票分析师相关的成本降低25％，这被估计为欧洲交易所总体交易成本的7％减少，并使澳大利亚的交易所相关成本减少15％。我们相信，基于区块链的交易所具有的这种显著降低成本的潜力将加速从传统组织的交易所向基于区块链的交易所的过渡。

    by a country’s legal system characteristics. As pointed by Block et al. [[5](#CR5)],
    countries with stronger regulation can lower the cost of entry and ensure contractual

- en: Lee [[33](#CR33)] provides us with a useful analogy to consider by discussing
    massive changes that we have seen in the U.S. Postal Service as a result of the
    introduction of email as the preferred medium of communication. The most appropriate
    and likely route to adoption of blockchain technologies is a slower, more thoughtful
    and patient adoption of a blockchain solution. According to the author, a complete
    replacement of the institutions and systems that are currently available to broker
    exchange related transactions in the securities markets would engender significant
    institutional inertia. First, many jobs are dependent on the current structure
    and an ouright replacement would cause massive job market dislocations in these
    industries. Second, laws that regulate the securities markets would have to receive
    a massive overhaul, which provides a framework to transact over these new exchanges.

- en: Andolfatto [[2](#CR2)] raises some questions about the immutability of the blockchain
    network. The author also looks at whether the blockchain or distributed ledger
    system is worth it and if the traditional trust-based methods of transacting are
    superior to these more consensus-driven solutions. Berentsen and Schar [[4](#CR4)]
    illustrate that through a consensus-based framework where the miners in a system
    (i.e., auditors) are incentivized to reach agreements about additions to the blockchain
    because that is how they generate compensation and that this leads to efficiency.
    However, according to the authors “mining is expensive, as the computations use
    large amounts of electricity and are increasingly dependent on highly specialized
    hardware.” Andolfatto [[2](#CR2)] and Berentsen and Schar [[4](#CR4)] also look
    at the potential benefits associated with a blockchain solution to securities
    market transactions, and question whether the benefits that society potentially
    may receive from a system built on the blockchain network would outweigh the costs
    from an economic and social perspective. Further, Cai [[8](#CR8)] suggests that
    advances in blockchain technologies will likely be applied by financial intermedaries
    to obtain further cost advantages, which they may share with their clients, but
    their applications of these advances in technology will likely help them to retain
    their monopolistic position.

- en: Before we start to imagine the future of blockchain-based securities exchanges,
    we should focus briefly on the underlying structure. Three major features of a
    blockchain ledger are openness, decentralization, and continuous competitive record
    validation. In an open public blockchain ledger, past transactions are saved on
    multiple computers in a peer network. To prevent tampering with records, transactions
    are periodically bundled into blocks. A cryptographic hash is calculated from
    the contents of each block and a unique hash identifier is assigned to that block.
    Each block contains the most recent transactions as well as a link, in terms of
    the previous block’s hash, to information from all past blocks. Bundling of the
    blocks creates a chain of blocks, or blockchain. Modifying any part of the past
    transaction record changes the hash related to the block where the transaction
    was originally recorded as well as hashes related to all subsequent blocks. Therefore,
    each node verifies hashes locally, but the validation of transactions is performed
    by comparing hash identifiers stored on multiple computers in the peer network
    (i.e., based on consensus throughout the network). If anyone alters any block
    in the chain, the hashes associated with the altered blockchain will not match
    the peers’ records of the blockchain and, therefore, the altered record will be
    discovered.

  zh: 在我们开始想象基于区块链的证券交易所的未来之前，我们应该简要关注底层结构。 区块链账本的三个主要特征是开放性、去中心化和持续的竞争性记录验证。 在公开的区块链账本中，过去的交易被保存在对等网络中的多台计算机上。
    为了防止记录篡改，交易会定期打包成块。 从每个块的内容计算出一个加密哈希，并为该块分配一个唯一的哈希标识符。 每个块包含最新的交易以及与所有过去块的信息相关联的上一个块哈希的链接。
    块的打包形成了一个块链，或称为区块链。 修改任何过去交易记录的部分会更改与原始记录该交易的块相关的哈希以及与所有后续块相关的哈希。 因此，每个节点都会在本地验证哈希，但交易的验证是通过比较存储在对等网络中的多台计算机上的哈希标识符来完成的（即，基于整个网络的共识）。
    如果有人更改链中的任何块，则与更改后的区块链相关的哈希将与对等方的区块链记录不匹配，因此将发现更改后的记录。
- en: In the case of the Bitcoin blockchain network, the hash identifiers must start
    with a certain number of zeros. To create such a hash identifier for each respective
    block of data, a certain number, called “nonce”, is added to the block of data.
    Peers on the blockchain network (called miners) try to compute (or mine) the “nonce”
    as quickly as possible. The peer that computes the “nonce” first closes the block
    of data and receives some compensation in form of Bitcoins. The closed block is
    then added to the blockchain and distributed to network peers. If anyone wanted
    to alter any existing block of data, they would have to re-compute “nonces” for
    the respective and all subsequent blocks more efficiently than other peers which
    is very costly (or almost impossible) by design. The miners are, therefore, not
    really mining anything—they exist to validate that the blocks are accurate and
    that they have not been tampered with.

  zh: 在比特币区块链网络的情况下，哈希标识符必须以一定数量的零开始。 为了为每个相应数据块创建这样的哈希标识符，将一个称为“nonce”的数字添加到数据块中。
    区块链网络上的对等方（称为矿工）尝试尽快计算（或挖掘）“nonce”。 首先计算出“nonce”的对等方关闭数据块，并以比特币形式获得一些补偿。 然后，关闭的块添加到区块链并分发给网络对等方。
    如果有人想要更改任何现有的数据块，他们将不得不比其他对等方更有效地重新计算相应的和所有后续块的“nonce”，这在设计上是非常昂贵的（或几乎不可能的）。 因此，矿工实际上并未挖掘任何东西——它们存在的目的是验证块是否准确且未被篡改。

    on the supply-side is verified by a distributed group of auditors or miners just
    as the amount of capital available to purchase the security from the demand side
    is verified based on previous records contained within the existing blockchain.
    Once agents *D* and *S* agree to transact, a record of their transaction is amended
    to the previous block and becomes a portion of the blockchain. From a recordkeeping
    and auditing perspective, the utilization of the blockchain solution seems to

    and the frictional market leads to a Walrasian outcome and pushes transaction
    costs to zero. On the other hand, if the intermediation business has fixed entry
    cost that provides a prohibitive barrier to entry, then the industrial structure
    is more properly defined as a natural monopoly. The intermediary acts akin to
    a monopolist to maximize profits but is constrained to some extent by the competition
    from the frictional market. Intermediation in the equity markets, in which market
    makers and specialists trade their own inventories to assist in price discovery,
    adds value. However, if intermediaries extract unfair ‘profits’ from engaging

    retain a record of their transactions, to hold the security certificates that
    they had in ‘street form’ so that they could make transactions instantaneously,
    to provide them with quotes on the securities that they were interested in purchasing
    or liquidating, and to guarantee that the security that they were purchasing was

- en: To highlight how two-sided networks work, Parker and Van Alstyne [[40](#CR40)]
    in their comparison of QWERTY and VHS, and the network effects generated on the
    demand-side, indicated that the incumbent supplier of a particular good, be it
    the QWERTY or the VHS, does not welcome competition because there would be no
    way to benefit initially from that additional supplier entering the market. Nevertheless,
    consumers prefer competition because it gives them more choices about who they
    purchase their goods from. It also puts downward price pressure on the goods and
    offers an alternative if the incumbent firm goes out of business. In this case,
    the externality runs from producers to consumers. According to Parker et al. [[40](#CR40)],
    initially the consumer is not really concerned about how many other consumers
    adopt a particular platform because additional consumers might price them out
    of the market. However, producers are really concerned about how many consumers
    use their platform because the number of consumers that adopt their chosen platform
    affects their production opportunities. In this case, the externality runs from
    consumers to producers. Similarly, the network externalities, according to Parker
    et al. [[40](#CR40)] can run either way and both producers and consumers prefer
    growth in their respective markets; however, “this may be mediated by the indirect
    effect of the internetwork externality. At issue is whether own-market entry expands
    participation on the other side of each transaction.” When thinking about platforms
    and platform economics, Parker et al. [[40](#CR40)] introduce the ‘platform’ as
    a third participant in this marketplace that straddles “both markets, can set
    prices more efficiently by internalizing these two-sided externalities. Independent
    firms serving either market separately lose this advantage.”

  zh: 在探索建立区块链解决方案进行证券市场交易的潜在想法时，需要考虑的一个重要因素是由于实施这样的解决方案可能会产生的网络外部性。在本节中，我们将考虑积极或消极的外部性可能如何影响平台运营商的利润机会。考虑到Katz和Shapiro
    [[29](#CR29)]提出的外部性模型。作者们发展了一个网络竞争的一般模型，并设计了一个偏微分均衡寡头模型，在这个模型中没有收入效应，消费者的目标是最大化他们的个人剩余。然而，消费者最大化个人剩余的能力取决于他们对未来与他们选择购买的品牌（或者在我们的情况下是平台）相关联的网络规模的了解和正确预测。
- en: 'According to Katz et al. [[29](#CR29)], the process for developing expectations
    about the future size of the platforms and which platform to choose develops as
    follows: (i) consumers form their expectations about the future size of the platform,
    (ii) platforms play an output or volume game and propose a series of prices, and
    (iii) consumers choose a platform by comparing their reservation prices and the
    prices set by the ‘*n*’ firms. The authors propose the following model using firms
    instead of platforms:![$$\gamma_{i}^{e} = x_{i}^{e} \,\,\left( {{\text{Without}}\,{\text{

- en: 'Of further interest to our present analysis, Katz et al. [[29](#CR29)] indicated
    that there are three consumption externalities that one should consider when analyzing
    the network effects associated with the choice of a platform or exchange: (i)
    a direct network effect that is associated with an investor’s willingness (reluctance)
    to trade on a particular platform because a friend or someone that she knows had
    a positive (negative) experience trading on that platform, (ii) an indirect externality
    resulting from the demand and supply-side belief that the exchange will be adopted
    by other agents, and (iii) an externality resulting from the bolt-on or add-on
    services associated with the marketplace. The first two network effects are critical
    to establishing the blockchain based solution in any specific geographic location.
    The third effect seems to be the most critical when contemplating broader scale
    adoption and integration on a global scale. Katz et al. [[29](#CR29)] argue that
    the output of an industry, or a number of transactions in our case, increases
    by ensuring that platforms are compatible.'

  zh: 对于我们目前的分析进一步感兴趣的是，Katz等人[[29](#CR29)]指出，在分析与选择平台或交易所相关的网络效应时，应考虑三种消费外部性：（i）直接网络效应，即投资者愿意（不愿意）在特定平台上交易，因为一个朋友或认识的人在该平台上交易有积极（消极）的经验；（ii）间接外部性，由于需求方和供给方认为其他代理商将采用该交易所而产生的外部性；（iii）与市场相关的附加服务的外部性。前两种网络效应对于在任何特定地理位置建立基于区块链的解决方案至关重要。第三个效应似乎在考虑更广泛的规模采用和全球范围内整合时最为关键。Katz等人[[29](#CR29)]认为，通过确保平台兼容，行业的产出或在我们的案例中的交易数量增加。

    mechanisms that aid in the transfer of shares across nations, simultaneously converting
    the ask prices for securities traded in foreign markets into the domestic currency,
    and allowing access to securities that were more costly to purchase under the

  zh: 4.2 路由规则
- en: Hermalin and Katz [[23](#CR23)] took a somewhat different approach in their
    analysis of two-sided markets. Instead of analyzing intermediaries, they focused
    their attention on the routing implications associated with platform choice. The
    main conclusions reached by the authors is that “membership decisions can override
    formal rules and lead to counterintuitive equilibrium outcomes.” They continue
    by explaining that, in equilibrium, if party *A* is considering a transaction
    with party *B* and there are multiple networks to transact over, and party *A*
    is also given formal authority to route the order, the transaction tends to be
    routed through party *B*’s preferred network. In addition, all else equal, if
    one network imposes routing restrictions on its participants, that network receives
    a lower share of transactions than its competitors. Thus, allowing prospective
    parties to choose the platform on which they will transact will increase transaction
    volume throughout the system and minimize the potential problem of trade inefficiency
    [[23](#CR23)]. To relate this to our primary consideration, which is whether a
    blockchain alternative to the current securities transaction markets should exist,
    we need to look at whether it will positively impact the current securities market
    and whether such a market is likely to increase efficiency. Based on the above,
    we argue that routing by choice is preferred to mandated routing procedures both
    in terms of welfare maximization and in terms of the total volume of trade that
    would occur over both networks.

  zh: Hermalin 和 Katz [[23](#CR23)] 在他们对双边市场的分析中采取了稍微不同的方法。他们没有分析中介机构，而是将注意力集中在与平台选择相关的路由问题上。作者得出的主要结论是“成员决策可以覆盖正式规则并导致直觉上令人意外的均衡结果。”
    他们继续解释说，在均衡状态下，如果一方 *A* 正在考虑与另一方 *B* 进行交易，并且有多个可供交易的网络，并且一方 *A* 还被授予正式权力路由订单，那么交易往往会通过方
    *B* 的首选网络进行路由。此外，在其他条件相同的情况下，如果一个网络对其参与者施加路由限制，那么该网络将比其竞争对手接收到更少的交易份额。因此，允许潜在交易方选择他们将进行交易的平台将增加整个系统的交易量并最小化交易低效的潜在问题[[23](#CR23)]。为了将其与我们的主要考虑联系起来，即当前证券交易市场是否应该存在区块链替代方案，我们需要看一下它是否会对当前证券市场产生积极影响以及这样的市场是否可能提高效率。基于以上分析，我们认为自由选择路由优于强制性路由程序，无论是从福利最大化的角度还是从两个网络的总交易量的角度来看都是如此。

    virtual monopoly over the provision of securities laws” ever since they passed
    the Securities Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934\. Further, the author explains that
    because U.S. securities exchanges were the most liquid in the world, there was
    little danger of multinational corporations going elsewhere to raise capital and,
    therefore, they needed to follow the rules associated with raising debt and equity
    in U.S. capital markets. However, over time the public market for the provisioning
    of securities laws is evolving because the services offered by exchanges are becoming
    commoditized as floor-based exchanges are being replaced by electronic trading
    systems. To compete globally, national regulators (and legislatures) are motivated
    to provide attractive, cost-effective rules for foreign and domestic companies
    in order to protect or grow their domestic exchanges and financial centers. The
    study concludes that the consolidation of stock exchanges across the globe creates
    a market for the provisioning of securities laws.

  zh: 5.2 前进的道路
- en: Using the four quadrants associated with the adoption of foundational technologies,
    as illustrated in Iansiti et al. [[25](#CR25)], we think that the most direct
    path towards the adoption of blockchain technology to help facilitate securities
    transactions will likely start through single use and localization applications,
    which are not complex, but move from a low to high degree of novelty. According
    to Iansiti et al. [[25](#CR25)], the single use applications create better, cheaper,
    and highly focused solutions while the localization applications contain innovations
    that are relatively high in novelty but need only a limited number of users to
    create immediate value which promotes their prompt implementation. Similar to
    how the knowledge associated with the average portfolio manager’s inability to
    generate abnormal returns has led investors to move capital into more passive
    index or exchange-traded fund solutions, we believe that ETFs could lead the transition
    towards a blockchain-based securities network by creating private blockchain solutions
    to facilitate local exchange in their products. ETFs are currently able to externalize
    the costs associated with their transactions and with the distribution of their
    investments, a next logical step is for the low-cost investment instruments to
    minimize the costs associated with processing and settling transactions in these
    securities, and to potentially externalize these costs as well. This could be
    done using the blockchain and the fact that the ETF managers match buyers and
    sellers of their ETFs makes a private blockchain network a meaningful and logical
    step towards a more efficient and cost-effective method to settle and process
    these transactions, especially with ETFs that trade frequently.

  zh: 利用与基础技术采用相关的四个象限，如Iansiti等人所述[[25](#CR25)]，我们认为采用区块链技术帮助促进证券交易的最直接路径可能始于单一应用和本地化应用，这些应用并不复杂，但是从低到高的新奇度逐渐增加。根据Iansiti等人[[25](#CR25)]的说法，单一应用可以创建更好、更便宜和高度聚焦的解决方案，而本地化应用包含相对新颖但只需要有限数量用户即可创造即时价值的创新，从而促进其快速实施。类似于普通投资组合经理无法产生异常收益所带来的知识导致投资者将资金转移到更为被动的指数或交易所交易基金解决方案，我们相信ETF可能通过创建私人区块链解决方案来促进向基于区块链的证券网络的过渡，以促进其产品的本地交易。目前，ETF能够外部化与其交易和投资分配相关的成本，下一个逻辑步骤是低成本投资工具将最小化处理和结算这些证券交易的成本，并可能同样将这些成本外部化。这可以通过区块链来实现，而ETF经理匹配其ETF的买方和卖方的事实使私人区块链网络成为更高效、更具成本效益的结算和处理这些交易的方法的有意义和合理的一步，特别是对于频繁交易的ETF而言。
- en: Once investors experience the reductions in costs associated with trading and
    purchasing securities over these private blockchain networks, we may be able to
    think about scale, network effects, and externalities that could result from public
    blockchain networks. Iansiti et al. [[25](#CR25)] highlighted how this single
    use and localized blockchain networks evolve into networks that act as potential
    substitutes for the incumbent methods that people rely on to transact and move
    towards transforming the industry. According to the authors, ‘substitution’ occurs
    when there is a high level of coordination and complexity associated with transactions,
    but the degree of novelty is low. Eventually, transformation occurs when the amount
    of complexity and coordination involved with transactions increases, but the degree
    of novelty also increases. When we think about substitution, we realize that there
    will be substantial barriers to changing how investors think about transacting
    over securities markets. As mentioned earlier in this paper, there are institutions
    that have a substantial vested interest in ensuring that things stay the same,
    that investors continue to transact over their platforms, and that the regulators
    that have the authority to devise rules and regulations that monitor transactions
    have no incentive to change how we transact, even if a new transaction mechanism
    could enhance the investor’s experience and increase efficiency. Further, Cichonczyk
    [[11](#CR11)] claims that disintermediation will probably never occur because
    the current market intermediaries are incentivized to overcome any potential disintermediation
    in the financial markets. Cohen [[12](#CR12)] points out what happened to the
    taxi industry as they failed to innovate and respond to advances in technology
    and watched their market power disappear as Uber disrupted their control over
    the ‘taxi-cab’ market, meaning that there is an opportunity to disrupt this market,
    but the question of who will disrupt it is very important. Public blockchain-based
    exchanges could be used as a substitute to the traditional brokered exchanges
    and this is the point of technological innovation at which this would begin to
    occur. During this step, we envision smaller private blockchain networks integrating
    into a more global public blockchain network but maintaining the traditional brokered
    exchanges so that investors are able to choose which medium they use to complete
    their transactions. As earlier examples of Australian Stock Exchange’s and Nasdaq’s
    move towards blockchain-based systems have illustrated, the first step towards
    innovation has occurred, but the transition from the private to public blockchain
    solution to the typical brokered exchange will likely take time.

  zh: 一旦投资者体验到与在这些私有区块链网络上交易和购买证券相关的成本降低，我们可能会考虑到公共区块链网络可能产生的规模、网络效应和外部性。Iansiti等人[[25](#CR25)]指出了这种单一使用和局部化的区块链网络是如何演变成潜在替代人们依赖于进行交易并向产业转型的现有方法的网络的。根据作者的说法，“替代”发生在交易中存在高度协调和复杂性，但新颖程度较低时。最终，当交易涉及的复杂性和协调程度增加时，新颖程度也会增加，转变就会发生。当我们考虑替代时，我们意识到改变投资者对证券市场交易方式的看法将会存在重大障碍。正如本文前面提到的，有些机构有着极大的利益，希望确保事情保持不变，投资者继续在其平台上交易，并且监管机构没有动力改变我们的交易方式，即使新的交易机制可能提升投资者的体验并增加效率。此外，Cichonczyk[[11](#CR11)]声称，去中介化可能永远不会发生，因为目前的市场中介机构有动力克服金融市场中任何潜在的去中介化。Cohen[[12](#CR12)]指出出租车行业未能创新和应对技术进步，观察到他们的市场权力随着优步颠覆了他们对“出租车”市场的控制而消失的情况，这意味着有机会颠覆这个市场，但谁将颠覆它是非常重要的问题。基于公共区块链的交易所可以用作传统经纪交易所的替代，这是技术创新的开始。在这一步骤中，我们设想较小的私有区块链网络将整合成一个更全球化的公共区块链网络，但保留传统的经纪交易所，以便投资者能够选择使用哪种媒介完成交易。正如澳大利亚证券交易所和纳斯达克向基于区块链的系统迈出的早期步骤所证明的那样，创新的第一步已经完成，但从私有到公共区块链解决方案向典型的经纪交易所的过渡可能需要一些时间。

  zh: 6 挑战
- en: As mentioned earlier, there is a number of challenges or obstacles that need
    surmounting to disintermediate securities markets and offer a global blockchain
    solution that would reduce cost and improve efficiency across the global financial
    markets. First, as securities transactions become more commoditized, regulators
    should look to install and adopt governance mechanisms that better facilitate
    global transactions as the current governance mechanisms create unnecessary costs
    and execution delays. Scalability seems to be the next challenge, as Chang et
    al. [[10](#CR10)] suggested, as even more advanced networks, such as Ethereum
    and Bitcoin, can only handle 20 transactions per second. However, according to
    Ventura [[48](#CR48)], some blockchain solutions can exceed 1 million transactions
    per second, so a solution could be built to solve some of the scalability issues.
    Security associated with the consensus mechanism is likely another challenge that
    a blockchain solution would have to solve. According to Reyna et al. [[43](#CR43)],
    there is a variety of security attacks (i.e., majority, double-spend, race, denial
    of service, and man in the middle attacks) that the builders of a system to facilitate
    trades across a global blockchain network should be aware of and protect against.
    Anonymity and privacy are also a concern; however, encrypting transactions could
    ensure anonymity [[10](#CR10), [43](#CR43)]. Finally, according to Chang et al.
    [[10](#CR10)] energy consumption associated with maintain a blockchain solution
    is a concern. For example, 3 Bitcoin transactions use as much energy as 300.000
    Visa transactions [[10](#CR10)]. Therefore, when developing a potential blockchain
    solution that would provide the infrastructure to facilitate securities market
    transactions over a global exchange the amount of energy and cost associated with
    consuming that energy should be considered. In summary, there is a number of challenges
    that developers and planners need to contend with before a global blockchain solution
    to facilitate securities market transactions is developed and deployed. However,
    these challenges do not seem insurmountable.

    Chang 等人所建议的那样，即使是更先进的网络，如以太坊和比特币，也只能处理每秒 20 笔交易。然而，根据 Ventura 的说法，一些区块链解决方案的交易量甚至可以超过每秒
    100 万笔，因此可以构建一个解决部分可扩展性问题的解决方案。与共识机制相关的安全性很可能是区块链解决方案必须解决的另一个挑战。根据 Reyna 等人的说法，存在各种安全攻击（即，多数、双重支付、竞争、拒绝服务和中间人攻击），应该提防并防范跨全球区块链网络进行交易的系统的建造者。匿名性和隐私问题也是一个关注点；然而，加密交易可以确保匿名性。最后，根据
    Chang 等人的说法，与维护区块链解决方案相关的能源消耗是一个问题。例如，3 笔比特币交易使用的能源与 30 万笔 Visa 交易相当。因此，在开发一个潜在的区块链解决方案以提供基础设施以促进全球交易所进行证券市场交易时，应考虑所消耗的能量量及与之相关的成本。总之，在全球证券市场交易的区块链解决方案开发和部署之前，开发人员和规划者需要应对一系列挑战。然而，这些挑战似乎并不是不可克服的。

- en: Our study illustrates how platform operators extract unfair rents on the investing
    public under the current regulatory regime and system and indicates how the economics
    of platforms might be used to think about implementing blockchain technologies
    more broadly to enhance the traditional process of exchange in securities markets.
    We argue that blockchain-based securities trading platforms should operate as
    a neutral party that straddles both sides of the market and act as a bridge between
    the supply-side and the demand-side and should not be positioned on one side of
    the transaction. Moving the blockchain-based platform from the supply-side to
    an intermediary position decreases the costs of the transaction for the customers
    and increases the potential for innovation in the process of securities market
    transactions. Implementation of open routing procedures should also positively
    impact the market in terms of welfare maximization and enhance efficiency.

  zh: 我们的研究说明了平台运营商在当前监管体制和系统下如何从投资公众身上获取不公平的租金，并表明了如何运用平台经济学来更广泛地考虑实施区块链技术，以增强证券市场的传统交易过程。我们认为，基于区块链的证券交易平台应该作为一个中立方运作，跨越市场的双方，并充当供给方和需求方之间的桥梁，并且不应该定位于交易的一方。将基于区块链的平台从供给方移动到中介位置可以降低客户的交易成本，并增加证券市场交易过程中创新的潜力。实施开放式路由程序也应该对市场的福利最大化和提高效率产生积极影响。
- en: Based on the literature, it seems likely that competition brought by implementation
    of blockchain-based securities exchanges alongside traditional exchanges will
    spur innovation, increase transparency, and increase efficiency, which all would
    likely benefit the participants in the marketplace in the long term. However,
    even though there seem to be significant benefits that could be realized by implementing
    a blockchain solution, we believe that, as is the case with the implementation
    of any new technology, further research must be completed to determine if the
    benefits associated with this type of solution outweigh the cost of maintaining
    the blockchain network from both a social and an economic standpoint.

  zh: 根据文献，实施基于区块链的证券交易所与传统交易所并存可能带来竞争，激发创新，增加透明度和提高效率，这些都可能从长远来看有利于市场参与者。然而，尽管实施区块链解决方案似乎会带来显著的好处，但我们认为，与实施任何新技术一样，必须进行进一步研究，以确定这种类型解决方案的好处是否超过了从社会和经济角度维护区块链网络的成本。
