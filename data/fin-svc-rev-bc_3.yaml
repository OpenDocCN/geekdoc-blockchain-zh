  zh: 结论
- en: ICOs are changing the fundraising landscape, but at a different level than most
    people seem to think today. While currently a large majority of ICOs have been
    done at the preproduction phase (i.e., at the seed level), we argue that it is
    very difficult—both for an ecosystem token and for an app coin—to avoid securities
    laws and regulations if a token is sold before its associated blockchain-based
    platform or decentralized application is built.

  zh: ICO正在改变筹资格局，但与大多数人今天所认为的不同层次上。尽管目前绝大多数ICO都是在项目尚未启动阶段完成的（即在种子阶段），但我们认为，如果一个代币在其相关的基于区块链的平台或去中心化应用构建之前就出售，很难避免符合证券法和监管规定。
- en: An ecosystem token constitutes an inherent component of its blockchain-based
    system and might therefore have a greater chance of being regarded as a utility
    token. However, the current SEC guidance with respect to the Howey test seems
    to confirm the idea that selling a token with an actual or potential utility does
    not constitute, as such, a sufficient condition to preclude it from being sold
    as a security. We must also take into account how tokens are marketed to the public
    and why people are buying them.

  zh: 生态系统代币构成了其基于区块链的系统的固有组成部分，因此可能更有可能被视为实用代币。然而，当前SEC关于Howey测试的指导似乎证实了这样一个想法，即销售具有实际或潜在实用性的代币并不构成其不作为证券的充分条件。我们还必须考虑代币如何向公众推广以及人们购买它们的原因。
- en: Hence, unless issuers want to introduce specific technical guarantees that will
    reduce or eliminate speculative opportunities over the appreciation of their tokens
    (e.g., by making the tokens nontransferable or by creating a low-ceiling token
    price cap), they need to devise new approaches to ensure that the tokens being
    sold do not qualify as securities. While the SAFT (and the related SAFTE) is an
    interesting proposition for achieving that goal, the SEC will likely not accept
    its logic, post-Munchee.

  zh: 因此，除非发行人希望引入特定的技术保证，以减少或消除其代币升值的投机机会（例如，通过使代币不可转让或创建低限价格上限代币），否则他们需要制定新方法，以确保出售的代币不被视为证券。虽然SAFT（和相关的SAFTE）是实现这一目标的有趣提议，但SEC在Munchee案后可能不会接受其逻辑。
- en: There is an inherent conflict between the use of an ecosystem token as a coordinating
    mechanism and as a fundraising instrument similar to securities. Taking a pragmatic
    approach, open-source blockchain-based ecosystems will initially have to build
    some profit centers by relying on fundraising practices typical of private enterprises
    and start-ups. As such, these ecosystems may develop as the traditional Web 2.0
    model did.

  zh: 生态系统代币作为协调机制和类似证券的筹款工具之间存在固有的冲突。采取务实的方法，基于开源区块链的生态系统最初将不得不通过依赖私营企业和初创企业典型的筹款实践来建立一些利润中心。因此，这些生态系统可能会像传统的
    Web 2.0 模型一样发展。

- en: We believe that ICOs, especially for true ecosystem tokens, will have to move
    away from the preproduction phase (seed round) and instead be conducted at funding
    rounds in postproduction phases (series A, B, C, etc.), when there is a minimally
    viable network or product with a ready base of users and customers. Only after
    the platform has been deployed and an ecosystem has emerged around it, will the
    utility emerge and the value inherent in these tokens become apparent to all.
    Then the issuer will finally be able to sell tokens as true goods or commodities
    rather than as investment instruments.

  zh: 我们相信，ICO，尤其是对于真正的生态系统代币，将不得不远离前期阶段（种子轮），而是在后期阶段的融资轮进行，当网络或产品具有最低可行性，并且有一批准备好的用户和客户时（A
    轮、B 轮、C 轮等）。只有在平台部署并围绕其形成生态系统之后，效用才会显现出来，这些代币中固有的价值才会为所有人所认识到。然后，发行者最终将能够将代币作为真正的商品或商品出售，而不是作为投资工具。
- en: To do so, token issuers might need to devise creative corporate forms combining
    nonprofit structures (overseeing access to shared open-source resources) with
    for-profit structures (perhaps as benefit corporations or B Corps) focused on
    the development of specific business applications or Dapps. Most ICOs will not
    be true ecosystem tokens and will therefore be well suited as securities token
    offerings using registration exemptions and trading through decentralized alternative
    trading systems.

    including fundraisings such as ICOs and ongoing market oversight. Indeed, significant
    questions remain around how to think about and discuss token “economics,” that
    is, the factors that should drive utility value, and whether token price bounding
    would allay some of the SEC’s concerns.

    necessity for some speculative activity square with regulatory concerns around
    secondary markets, while respecting the functional requirements of an ecosystem
    token? As we try to create more decentralized economic models assisted by blockchain
