  zh: 结论
- en: At the very beginning of this book, I wrote that many people do not take cryptocurrency
    seriously because of the many myths surrounding the market. Let's summarize these
    myths now and finally dispel them.

  zh: 在这本书的开头，我写道，许多人并不认真对待加密货币，因为市场周围有太多的神话。现在让我们总结这些神话，并最终驱散它们。
- en: 'First, a lot of people think that the most important and attractive thing in
    the cryptocurrency market is the potential for large profits and enter the market
    only for this reason. However, in my opinion, the profit is an absolutely secondary
    thing, which you can make in any business. The question is: what risks are you
    willing to take? Therefore, the most important topic in cryptocurrency is risk.'

  zh: 首先，很多人认为加密货币市场上最重要和吸引人的事情是巨大的利润潜力，并且只因为这个原因进入市场。然而，在我看来，利润是绝对次要的事情，你可以在任何生意中赚到。问题是：你愿意承担什么风险？因此，加密货币最重要的主题是风险。
- en: At the same time, it is said that the ratio of profits to risk is very distorted
    in the cryptocurrency market. Some people suppose that if you take a small risk
    in any other market and get a small profit from it, then here you get hundreds
    of times more profit when taking the same amount of risk. It is not true. The
    ratio of profits to risks is always approximately average. If it was really possible
    to get a large profit with low risks, Swiss banks would be emptied of all banknotes
    because everybody would have already invest in this business.

  zh: 同时，据说加密货币市场的利润与风险的比例非常扭曲。有些人认为，在任何其他市场上承担一点风险并获得一点利润，在这里承担同样的风险就能获得百倍的利润。这不是真的。利润与风险的比例总是大约平均的。如果真的有可能在低风险的情况下获得高利润，那么瑞士银行里的所有钞票都会被取空，因为每个人都会已经投资这个生意。
- en: Many others also argue that it is too late to dive into the cryptocurrency market
    because it has become popular recently and all the profits have already been made
    and divided. I agree only with the fact it is going to be tough on the newcomers
    because of all the cryptocurrency hype but is this the reason to think that it's
    too late to get into the market and get your tidbit? If you constantly study,
    strive and try, you will also start to make good money. Hard work always pays
    off. It may take you more time and resources, but a slogger will definitely be
    rewarded with success.

  zh: 许多人还认为，由于最近加密货币市场变得很受欢迎，所有的利润都已经产生并分配了，所以现在进入加密货币市场为时已晚。我同意的唯一事实是，对于新来者来说，由于所有加密货币的炒作，将会很艰难，但是这是不是认为进入市场获取自己的一份为时已晚的理由呢？如果你不断学习，努力和尝试，你也会开始赚很多钱。努力工作总是有回报的。这可能需要你更多的时间和资源，但是一个勤奋的人肯定会因为成功而得到回报。
- en: Apart from the opinion that it is too late to enter the market now, some people
    say that only programmers or professional traders can work in this market. This
    is a myth. If you are a doctor, a teacher, or a middle-rank manager, you also
    can earn big dough in the cryptocurrency market. One can learn the necessary information
    and acquire the necessary skills no matter what their current skills. Nobody is
    born to be an artist, but you can become an artist by mastering different drawing
    techniques.

  zh: 除了认为现在进入市场为时已晚的观点，还有一些人说只有程序员或职业交易员才能在这个市场上工作。这是错误的。如果你是医生、老师或中层管理者，你也可以在加密货币市场上赚很多钱。无论你目前技能如何，一个人可以学习必要的信息和获得必要的技能。没有人天生就是艺术家，但你可以通过掌握不同的绘画技巧成为艺术家。
- en: By and large, I do not know what conclusions you have drawn for yourself after
    reading my book. I only hope that you at least now know that cryptocurrency is
    a present-day reality, not a matter of the future. The sooner you understand this,
    the further you can tear yourself away from the sceptics who run behind the locomotive.
    Therefore, I strongly advise you to say "yes" to cryptocurrency.

  zh: 总的来说，我不知道您在阅读了我的书后得出了自己的什么结论。我只希望，您至少现在知道加密货币是当今的现实，而不是未来的事情。您越早理解这一点，您就能越远离那些在火车后面追赶的怀疑论者。因此，我强烈建议您对加密货币说“是”。
- en: If you read this book from front to back, I also wholeheartedly believe that
    I’ve helped you not just to sort through the cryptocurrency myths and basics but
    also helped you create a foundation for profitable long-term business in this
    area. A keystone has already been laid, but this is just the beginning. Now everything
    depends on you. Interpret the knowledge as it is possible to learn and receive
    something only by making attempts. Make first steps in the cryptocurrency market
    using the least risky strategies.

  zh: 如果你从头到尾读完这本书，我坚信我已经帮助你不仅仅是整理了加密货币的谣言和基础知识，还帮助你在这个领域创建了盈利的长期业务的基石。已经奠定了关键的一块石头，但这只是开始。现在一切取决于你。用可能的办法去理解和尝试，只有尝试才能获得收获。使用最低风险的策略，在加密货币市场中迈出第一步。
- en: Now I want to address those who are sure that there is no need to make special
    efforts in this business. You may think that it will be enough for you to press
    the "start" button and money will fall from the sky. If you have already imagined
    yourself sitting by the ocean hoping that the cryptocurrency business will allow
    you to travel all the time without the need to work, you are very wrong. This
    business, like any other, requires that you get off the couch and put your strength,
    brains, and money to work to create a successful future.

  zh: 现在，我想对那些肯定不需要在这个行业中做出特别努力的人说句话。你可能认为，只要你按下“开始”按钮，钱就会从天而降。如果你已经想象着自己坐在海边，希望加密货币业务能让你不需要工作就能一直旅行，那你大错特错了。这个行业，和其他任何行业一样，要求你离开沙发，动用你的体力、智慧和资金，为你创造一个成功的未来而努力。
- en: The main thing required from you is to believe in yourself and in cryptocurrency.
    After all, it's those people who believed in Bitcoin a few years ago that now
    have a huge fortune and influence today. Therefore, believe in the dawn of the
    cryptocurrency economy!

  zh: 最后，提供几点建议。
- en: First, you shouldn’t take cryptocurrency too seriously. The cryptocurrency market
    is very volatile, and if you do not learn to be easy-going about risks and losses,
    you will drive yourself crazy. It is better to have an easy-going attitude to
    this business from the very beginning. Personally, I think it is impossible to
    survive in the cryptocurrency market without humor, and even a swear wordor two.
    At the same time, do not treat this business as a casino or a lottery. In the
    cryptocurrency market, you need to have a sound strategy and a strong sense of
    purpose.

  zh: 首先，你不应该太认真对待加密货币。加密货币市场非常波动，如果你不学会对风险和损失保持轻松的态度，你会把自己逼疯。从一开始就对这个业务持轻松的态度更好。我个人认为，在加密货币市场中生存是不可能没有幽默感的，甚至是一两个咒语😄。同时，不要把这生意当作赌场或彩票。在加密货币市场，你需要一个健全的策略和强烈的目标感。
- en: Second, you have to be cautious and sceptical of working in this market as we've
    already discussed at the very beginning of the book.
