    firm specializing in Web infrastructure, opened an online sales window. They offered
    only one item for sale that day, and all of twenty-four seconds later, the entire
    stock of one billion was sold out, leaving many potential customers bitter about
    being left out. The object of this ravenous demand? Brave had raised the equivalent
    of $35 million in the initial coin offering, or ICO, of its basic access tokens,

    在其基本访问代币（BAT）的首次代币发行中筹集了相当于 3500 万美元的资金。

    the first seven and a half months of 2017, almost $1.5 billion flowed into this
    new investment class. Like bitcoin, BATs involved a unique, tradable digital asset
    whose transactions were proven via a public, decentralized blockchain. But, unlike
    bitcoin, these tokens were typically designed for exchanges within a specific
    industry or among a community using a particular Dapp. Most weren’t mined on an
    ongoing basis, either; they were brought into existence through these one-off
    ICOs.

  zh: 在 2017 年春季末到夏季期间，ICO 狂热开始兴起。在 2017 年的头七个半月里，近 15 亿美元涌入了这个新的投资领域。与比特币类似，BAT（Basic
    Attention Token）涉及一种独特的可交易数字资产，其交易通过公开、去中心化的区块链来验证。但与比特币不同的是，这些代币通常设计用于特定行业内的交易或者在使用特定
    Dapp 的社区之间进行交换。而且，大多数代币也不是通过持续挖掘产生的；它们是通过这些一次性的 ICOs（首次代币发行）创造出来的。

    new records for the biggest crowdfunding exercises in history. But what was striking
    about the Brave sale, which unlike many other larger ICOs was deliberately capped
    in size, was the sheer speed of incoming orders. It was clear that investors bought
    into Brave’s promise of a token that could fundamentally change the broken online
    advertising industry. Brave took in Ethereum’s ether as the incoming currency
    for the rapid-fire sale, which raised some concerns about heavyweight investors
    muscling less nimble players out of the pool. But it also said something about
    the appeal of Brave’s unique value proposition. It represented the first effort
    to put a value on a resource that all of us are constantly giving up for little
    to no return: our attention. Here was the real power of this new idea of tokens.
    They offered a way to redefine and revalue the very exchange of resources around

    better analytics, direct-to-customer marketing, and greater revenue for quality
    content. It’s fair to say each of the three stakeholder segments of the online
    content economy—publishers, advertisers, and users (readers/viewers)—has something
    to complain about. For users, the scourge of banner ads and unsolicited promotional
    videos is not only deteriorating the Web site experience, it is literally costing
    them bandwidth. (By one estimate, $23 a month of people’s mobile phone bill pays
    for ads they don’t want.) For advertisers, “bots” that generate fake traffic data
    have inflated rates for unworthy Web sites—resulting in $7.2 billion in losses
    for the industry in 2016, according to the Association of National Advertisers.
    Meanwhile, plunging CPMs, the standard costs-per-impression measure by which ad
    charge-out rates are set, are hurting mainstream publishers as their sites compete
    with the relentlessly expanding supply of alternative online content from blogs
    and social media. Perhaps inevitably, consumers are turning to ad-blocking software,

- en: The Tragedy of the Commons concept stems from a 1968 essay by the ecologist
    Garrett Hardin. Hardin tells the story of nineteenth-century farmers over-grazing
    the public land they shared because none of them could trust their counterparts
    not to let their livestock eat more than their fair share. It has long been used
    as a cautionary tale about the need for government to regulate access to a public
    resource—in the farmers’ case, land. Ever since then, the “commons” has become
    a catchall for any “space” of public value, tangible or intangible, that needs
    protection. It is why, for example, people talk about free speech and copyright-free
    content on the Internet belonging to a “creative commons” zone that should be
    protected by laws, contractual agreements, and community activism. The issue is
    closely related to the classic economic problem of “externalities”—that capitalism
    can’t easily put a price on the costs that everyone bears when a public resource
    is depleted, such as when a factory pollutes the air.

- en: 'How does this relate to the ad and content industry? Well, like farmers sharing
    a commons, the online content industry has its own misused public resource, one
    that it struggles to put a fair price on: something Brave calls “user attention.”
    Everyone in the publishing and advertising space is competing over access to readers’
    and viewers’ eyeballs so that they can steer them toward content and entice them
    to buy something, whether it’s a newspaper subscription or an advertised product.
    But the industry does a lousy job of identifying and paying for that attention—starting
    with the way it compensates readers and viewers, who provide the resource. In
    theory, we are “paid” for our attention to advertising with access to the news
    and other information that we want to consume—falsely described as “free”—while
    advertisers pay the publishers for the privilege of siphoning off a portion of

    fallout from The DAO attack. Ether, which was trading at around $20 when the attack
    began in mid-June, sank as low as $8 during the monthlong aftermath and Ethereum
    hard fork. But because the ERC20 tokens are exclusively written on top of the
    Ethereum platform, such that the smart contracts that control them require payments
    in ether, the post-DAO enthusiasm for these tokens ended up more than rescuing
    the ether price. The ERC20 standard put ether in the sweet spot. Before then,
    bitcoin was really the only currency in which you could receive funds in a token
    sale. That was the case for Ethereum’s 2014 crowdsale and for other ICO trailblazers
    such as the decentralized storage provider Maidsafe. Now, the ICO currency of
    choice was ether. People had to buy ether to invest in the new wave of tokens,
    which created an upward spiral that benefited all the developers in the Ethereum
    ecosystem. Not only were their new ERC20 tokens escalating in value, but they
    also owned ether—a stash they’d either obtained as a reward for Ethereum mining
    or had acquired as an investment or to keep as a store of “fuel” to manage the
    execution of their smart contracts. And ether was skyrocketing. This positive
    feedback loop in turn inspired other Ethereum-based developers to come up with
    their own new token-based Dapps and go to market with an ICO, which further spurred
    demand for ether and accelerated the carousel of surging prices.

    offer high-risk/high-return investment opportunities to a wider group of people
    without venture capitalists getting in first on the ground floor. Why should VCs
    get all the action in early-stage investing? In fact, says Cornell cryptographer

    You can see it in their body language.” When it comes to traditional equity investing,
    venture capital funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, and so forth always
    had an advantage on smaller investors, because they’re exempt from regulations
    designed to protect the little guy. VCs are big enough to be designated as “accredited
    investors” by the SEC, so they’re allowed to invest in securities that haven’t
    gone through a public offering process, which would involve a prospectus and a
    host of other disclosures. That privilege has gotten the venture capitalists in

    Emin Gün Sirer 表示：“风投将其视为一个真正的潜在威胁。你可以从他们的语言和行为中看出来。” 在传统的股权投资方面，风险投资基金、私募股权基金、对冲基金等总是对较小的投资者有利，因为它们不受旨在保护小人物的法规的约束。风险投资者足够大，可以被
    SEC 指定为“合格投资者”，因此他们被允许投资未经过公开发行程序的证券，这将涉及一份招股说明书和一系列其他披露文件。这一特权使风险投资家成为过去二十年里所有大赌注的先驱者：Facebook、Google、Uber。

    craze gives him a way in. Why is he demanding it? “Because the public currently
    has no good places to park its money. They need returns. The banks are giving
    them one, two percent at most. They realized that VCs get far more in these new
    business models and they are eager to take on similar risks.” Gün Sirer is not
    fazed by the money that some are likely to lose, either. It’s just the risk of
    investing. “They might find sometimes when they really regret the decisions they’ve
    made, but this community also seems quite independent and at home with the consequences
    of its actions. You don’t see people organizing against so and so and saying ‘let’s
    create a regulatory push.’ That’s very exciting on its own.”

    Gün Sirer对某些人可能损失的钱并不担心。这只是投资的风险。“他们可能有时会对自己所做的决定感到非常遗憾，但这个社区似乎也相当独立，并且对自己行为的后果感到很自在。你不会看到人们组织起来反对某某，说‘让我们来进行监管推动’。这本身就非常令人兴奋。”

    a new legal vehicle called a Special Agreement for Future Tokens, or SAFT, to

    as a SAFE (Special Agreement for Future Equity), which professional investors
    sometimes enter into with companies yet to issue equity, SAFTs would be sold to
    accredited investors—which must have at least $1 million in liquid net worth and
    more than $200 million in income—assuring the process is legally kosher from day
    one. “The issuers then use the funds they raise to develop the platform’s network,”
    said Cooley’s Santori. “Only then, once the network is functional, and tokens
    are functioning as a real product, can they be sold to the public.” The SAFT gets
    around the risk that the SEC will judge many ICOs to be securities if their tokens
    aren’t yet part of a functioning, decentralized platform. Many investors are clearly
    buying into ICOs in the expectation of profit and are relying on the development
    team’s platform-building work to achieve that, two qualities the SAFT designers
    say mean they will meet the Howey Test criteria and be treated as securities.
    The problem is that in limiting access to accredited investors, SAFTs are a step

    显然，许多投资者购买ICO是为了获利，并依赖于开发团队的平台建设工作来实现这一目标，SAFT设计者称这两个特征意味着他们将符合豪伊测试标准并被视为证券。 问题在于，限制对认可投资者的访问，SAFT距离像上文引用的Gün

  zh: 还有另一种方法可以传播代币、建立网络并资助平台的发展，而不会引起美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的行动，并在许多加密货币倡导者眼中保持你的诚信。那就是按照传统的加密货币方式做事：通过持续的挖矿过程将代币引入生态系统中。没有预售机制来奖励创始人并资助他们的运营。开发人员必须与所有其他矿工竞争，以在定期发布时获得代币的访问权限，就像中本聪在每个新的比特币区块中一样，从第一天开始。
- en: In this model, developers are always the earliest adopters, and so typically
    gain a head start in accumulating coins. But the question of fair distribution
    still comes up, especially with the proof-of-work algorithm. That’s because those
    who gain the most tokens are those with the most powerful computers. Yet not every
    mining-based cryptocurrency needs to end up as Bitcoin has, where only the biggest,
    most powerful computing operations—now managed on an industrial scale—can effectively
    compete for coins. Some new altcoins are designed to be “ASIC-resistant.” This
    means that the protocol’s in-built consensus algorithm—the puzzle miners must
    solve to win coins—compels their computers to carry out various functions that
    can’t easily be performed by existing versions of the super-fast Application-Specific
    Integrated Chips now uniformly embedded into the equipment of the biggest bitcoin
    miners. The idea is to give no special advantage to those who own these expensive,
    single-purpose raw computation machines. This means that people running computers
    with relatively inexpensive graphic processing units, or GPUs, can successfully
    compete for a decent supply of coins and that a wider distribution of those tokens
    is possible.

    a pact. If the platform’s governing principles include a pre-existing commitment
    from all users of the coin to accept a fork—a change to the code—that would add

  zh: 当前的全球资本主义设计，金钱不仅是交换的手段，而且是一种被拜物化的价值标志，我们受到激励去积累以展示我们的权力，这就是这个星球陷入混乱的原因。毫无疑问，我们应该重新设计这个系统，以拯救地球上的生命，这是我们对未来世代的债务。做到这一点的机会可能来自可编程货币——金钱本身不是一个最终目标的商品，而是一种仅仅是用来交换和共同生成价值的工具。
- en: Of course, it’s not just in the toxic poisoning of our planet that global capitalism
    and the political model that supports it are failing us. We have serious misalignments
    between the incentives for politicians to make laws that favor their corporate
    donors and the interests of the voters they are supposed to represent. The mass-marketed
    idea of retirement as some aspirational endpoint has created an industry of fund
    managers who peel off short-term profits every quarter while no one is properly
    incentivized to address the threats to those same assets that will come once our
    aging societies start driving economic productivity ever lower. These kinds of
    tensions are fueling terrorism, violence, insecurity, and a real risk that, one
    day, this toxic mix of protectionism, nationalism, and xenophobia will put us
    on a path to serious armed conflict.

  zh: 当然，全球资本主义及其支持的政治模式不仅在毒害我们的星球方面让我们失望。政治家制定法律以支持其企业捐赠者的动机与他们应代表的选民利益之间存在严重的错位。将退休视为某种值得追求的终点的大众市场化观念已经创造出一个基金经理行业，他们每个季度都会剥削短期利润，而在我们老龄化社会开始推动经济生产力下降后，没有人受到适当激励来应对同样资产面临的威胁。这些张力正在助长恐怖主义、暴力、不安全感，并存在着一个真实的风险，即有一天，这种毒性的保护主义、民族主义和仇外心理的混合将使我们走上一条通往严重武装冲突的道路。
- en: To be cynical about the prospect of change, though, is to give up. So, it’s
    in that spirit that we encourage people to reflect on these alternative visions
    for a post-capitalist society, to imagine these technologies as the platform for
    a future that is neither mired in the failed, collectivist ideas of socialism
    nor trapped by the centralized, exclusionary political economy of state-protected,
    big-business monopolies. These ideas offer a way out, but a way that requires
    a change in thinking about how value is created. Rather than framing the exchanges
    that define our life—of labor, assets, and ideas—as a means to acquire a particular
    form of money that’s defined by a symbolic banknote, we should explore new value
    models, whether with tokens or something else, that incentivize collaboration
    for the betterment of all.

  zh: 对于改变的前景持愤世嫉俗态度，意味着放弃。因此，我们鼓励人们以这种精神思考后资本主义社会的替代愿景，将这些技术想象成一个既不陷入失败的社会主义集体主义思想，也不受到由国家保护的大型企业垄断的中心化、排他性政治经济困扰的未来平台。这些想法提供了一种出路，但这种出路需要改变对价值创造方式的思考。我们应该探索新的价值模型，而不是将定义我们生活的交换（劳动、资产和思想）框定为获取一种由象征性纸币定义的特定形式的货币的手段，而是以令人鼓舞的合作为所有人的利益而奖励，无论是通过代币还是其他方式。
- en: The accumulation of wealth has never been a zero-sum game. When we engage in
    behavior that fosters a self-reinforcing feedback loop of inclusion, efficiency,
    and innovation, it’s possible to build wealth by creating it rather than taking
    it. Designed right, these new economic systems could marshal the forces of the
    market not to incentivize overpaid CEOs to build coal-powered generation plants
    but to make the most efficient use of our resources and those of the planet so
    that we all prosper. In the next chapter, we’ll dig more deeply into how blockchain
    technology offers new ways to reimagine this system.

  zh: 财富的积累从来都不是零和游戏。当我们参与行为，促进自我强化的包容、效率和创新的反馈循环时，通过创造而不是获取财富是可能的。如果设计得当，这些新的经济系统可以调动市场的力量，不是为了激励高薪CEO建造燃煤发电厂，而是为了最有效地利用我们自己和地球的资源，使我们所有人都能繁荣。在下一章中，我们将更深入地探讨区块链技术如何提供重新构想这一系统的新途径。
