  zh: 摘要
- en: The UK (United Kingdom) government published a guidance document in 2012 stipulating
    the use of project bank accounts (PBA) to promote fair and prompt payment practices
    in the construction industry. This article provides a high-level conceptual model
    utilising blockchain to automate project bank account payments. In PBA, project
    funds are partitioned in a separate bank account, like an escrow. Traditionally,
    before PBA, the main contractor would use the client’s project payments to reinvest
    in new work, or strategically withhold supply chain payments to sustain positive
    cash flow. PBA revokes the main contractor as the sole recipient of the project
    budget and provides the client with transparency over project expenditures. The
    proposed conceptual model allows project participants to approve and execute automated
    payments through user dashboards. Part of the security of smart contracts is their
    unchangeable properties once deployed; however, this is problematic, as construction
    projects regularly undergo change orders and programme alterations. Furthermore,
    Ethereum-based smart contracts in the current environment are limited due to the
    costs associated with auditing and on-chain hosting fees. To mitigate this, transactions
    in the PBA blockchain model are instantiated through an off-chain application,
    which stores pre-executed transactions in the form of signed messages. These messages
    are pushed to the blockchain and converted to transactions once they are approved
    by validating authorities. The result is a strategy to achieve payment automation
    at a more economical cost. The proposed model illustrates a high-level amalgamation
    of PBA, blockchain, off-chain, and asset tokenization. A limitation of this article
    is that it does not include any programming and the ideas are presented in the
    form of a flowchart. Future work includes programming the solution.

  zh: 英国政府于2012年发布了一份指导文件，规定使用项目银行账户（PBA）以促进建筑行业的公平和及时支付惯例。本文提供了一个高水平的概念模型，利用区块链来自动化项目银行账户支付。在PBA中，项目资金被分割存放在一个独立的银行账户中，就像一个第三方托管账户。在PBA之前，总承包商会利用客户的项目支付来重新投资新的工作，或者策略性地拖欠供应链支付以维持正现金流。PBA废除了总包商作为项目预算的唯一受益者，并为客户提供了对项目支出的透明度。所提出的概念模型允许项目参与者通过用户仪表板批准并执行自动支付。智能合约的安全性之一是它们一旦部署便不可更改的属性；然而，这是有问题的，因为建筑项目经常要进行变更和项目计划的修改。此外，在当前环境中基于以太坊的智能合约由于审计成本和链上托管费用的限制而受到限制。为了减轻这一问题，在PBA区块链模型中，交易是通过一个离链应用程序实例化的，该应用程序以签名消息的形式存储预执行的交易。这些消息被推送到区块链，并在获得验证机构的批准后转换为交易。其结果是通过更经济的成本实现支付自动化的一种策略。所提出的模型阐述了PBA、区块链、离链和资产代币化的高级融合。本文的一个局限是它没有包括任何编程，而是以流程图的形式呈现了这些想法。未来的工作包括对解决方案进行编程。

  zh: 1 引言
- en: The construction industry is known for having bad payment practices like overextended
    periods of delayed payments [[1](#CR1)]. Furthermore, the industry is still recuperating
    from the pertaining effects of the 2008 financial crisis, which left many construction
    companies with elevated capital expenditure, increased competition, and greater
    exposure to financial uncertainty [[2](#CR2)]. Commercial solutions to mitigate
    this include parent company guarantees, collateral warranties, and counterparty
    risk assessments [[3](#CR3)]. However, these do not address the primary concern
    of reducing delayed payments. Solving this problem would increase the stability
    of the industry by improving liquidity and reducing supply chain insolvencies,
    which leads to increased trust and reduced project risk [[4](#CR4)]. Data from
    the UK National Office of statistics in 2019 suggested that for every large company
    in the construction industry, there are on average 1000 small and medium enterprises
    [[5](#CR5)]. This imbalance creates over-competition and forces subcontractors
    to accept unfair contractual conditions, such as high-risk work for less pay [[6](#CR6)].

  zh: 建筑业以拖延期限的不良付款惯例而闻名，此外，行业仍在从2008年金融危机的相关影响中复苏，这导致许多建筑公司的资本支出增加、竞争加剧以及更大程度面临财务不确定性[[2](#CR2)]。商业解决方案包括母公司担保、担保凭证以及对手风险评估[[3](#CR3)]。然而，这些解决方案并未解决减少拖延付款的首要问题。解决这个问题将通过改善流动性、减少供应链破产从而增加信任和降低项目风险来增加行业稳定性[[4](#CR4)]。2019年英国国家统计办公室的数据表明，建筑行业每家大公司平均有1000家中小企业[[5](#CR5)]。这种不平衡导致了过度竞争，并迫使分包商接受不公平的合同条件，比如为了更少的报酬承担高风险工作[[6](#CR6)]。
- en: The construction and civil engineering industry is known for being risk-averse.
    From a structural perspective, the risk of collapse is linked to public safety;
    therefore, by default, safety standards are high [[7](#CR7)]. From a financial
    perspective, innovation is challenging due to low margins, which results in the
    overuse of legacy systems [[8](#CR8)]. Lack of innovation in technology systems
    is the principal contributor to poor productivity, adversarial supply chain relationships,
    and negative workflow fragmentation [[9](#CR9)]. Neighbouring industries such
    as manufacturing have managed to increase efficiencies annually throughout many
    generations, resulting in progressive productivity year after year [[10](#CR10)].
    Due to a lack of innovation, infrastructure projects are on average 80% over budget
    and 20% behind schedule; furthermore, productivity has been declining since 1990
    [[11](#CR11)]. Construction also suffers from a lack of transparency in company
    reports, whereby, stakeholders are subjected to inaccurate feedback on the state
    of a project [[12](#CR12)].

  zh: 建筑和土木工程行业以风险规避而闻名。从结构角度来看，倒塌的风险与公共安全有关；因此，默认情况下，安全标准很高[[7](#CR7)]。从财务角度来看，创新面临挑战，因为利润率低，导致了传统系统的过度使用[[8](#CR8)]。技术系统中缺乏创新是生产力低下、对立的供应链关系以及工作流程碎片化的主要原因[[9](#CR9)]。制造业等邻近产业成功地通过多个世代不断增加效率，导致了年复一年的渐进性生产力[[10](#CR10)]。由于缺乏创新，基础设施项目的平均预算超支80%，进度落后20%；此外，自1990年以来生产力一直在下降[[11](#CR11)]。建筑业还存在公司报告缺乏透明度的问题，利益相关者对项目状况得到不准确的反馈[[12](#CR12)]。
- en: The increasing global population has put additional pressure on the construction
    industry to build more with less, whilst in a skills shortage [[13](#CR13)]. Additionally,
    the industry is facing pressure to incorporate smart technologies and decarbonization
    solutions throughout the lifecycle of built assets [[14](#CR14)]. The demand for
    digital reform is required to meet the industrial dependencies of the modern economy
    [[15](#CR15)]. Blockchain includes the potential to increase efficiencies in multiple
    areas, such as payments, data management, automation, and systems integration
    [[16](#CR16)]. However, blockchain alone cannot be relied upon to drive the digital
    revolution. It is one of many components that need to work in harmony as part
    of an ecosystem of technology services.

- en: The first documented use of a project bank account (PBA) on a construction project
    was in 2005, through a joint venture between the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD)
    and the main contractor, which was created to ensure the auditability of government
    funds throughout an entire project [[17](#CR17)]. The UK government PBA guidance
    document was published in 2012, which discussed the partitioning of the project
    account away from the contractor to mitigate against cash farming and cascading
    payments down each tier of the supply chain [[18](#CR18)]. Cash farming is when
    a contractor unfairly withholds payments to their supply chain to improve internal
    cash flow.

- en: This article presents a conceptual model that amalgamates blockchain with PBA
    to automate the processing of supply chain payments, without having to use an
    intermediary to manage the PBA. In the proposed model, the partitioned account
    is represented by an off-chain database that controls the release of funds from
    the client to the supply chain. The PBA blockchain model attempts to bypass hosting
    on-chain (on the blockchain) smart contracts to mitigate transaction fees, development
    costs, and recoding when projects undergo change orders. The off-chain database
    is used to store pre-executed transactions that covert to transactions at a later
    point in time. This article provided a high-level process flow of the PBA blockchain
    model and the responsibilities of each transacting party.

- en: The detrimental effects of delayed payments in the UK construction industry
    were documented in the 1964 Banwell Report [[19](#CR19)], authored by Sir Harold
    Banwell, who was tasked with documenting the state of the industry. The construction
    industry is a large contributor to global GDP (Gross Domestic Product); however,
    it can increase its contribution further through innovating longstanding and outdated
    processes [[20](#CR20)]. The industry is particularly known for having a lack
    of trust caused by poor procurement practices, cash flow, and lack of collaboration
    [[21](#CR21)]. As a result, clients are hesitant to take on new work due to undisclosed
    risks and tight margins, which results in projects being selected based on low
    cost rather than long-term value [[22](#CR22)]. Innovation remains a perpetuating
    problem despite advancements in digital solutions such as building information
    modelling (BIM) [[23](#CR23)].

- en: The supply chain in the construction industry transacts and communicates through
    fragmented systems that do not integrate efficiently [[24](#CR24)]. These systems
    make it difficult to accurately report the state of a project with transparency
    and traceability [[24](#CR24)]. Despite this, the industry is pushing towards
    greater standardisation to increase productivity through bodies such as the International
    Standard Organisation (ISO), Industry Foundation Class (IFC) by building Smart,
    and governmental mandates that support digital tools such as BIM [[25](#CR25)].

- en: The construction industry is dominated by a small selection of main contractors
    who provide work for many small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which causes over-competition
    amongst SMEs and provides main contractors with controlling authority over the
    supply chain [[26](#CR26)]. SMEs are forced to accept unfair contractual conditions
    with overextended payment terms due to the hierarchical nature of the industry;
    whereby, contractors exercise *cash farming* techniques and *pay when paid* clauses
    [[4](#CR4)]. Cash farming is a strategy implemented by contractors to improve
    internal cash flow at the cost of delayed payments to their supply chain, furthermore,
    it allows the project budget to be used for investing in new work rather than
    paying outstanding debts [[27](#CR27)]. Despite the benefits of cash farming to
    contractors, it is the primary cause of SME insolvencies [[28](#CR28)]. Data from
    the Office of National Statistics suggest that the average quantity of individual
    insolvencies in the UK construction industry is recorded at 2595 cases annually,
    which accounts for 18% of the overall insolvent population in the UK and is the
    highest across all other industries [[29](#CR29)]. The danger of bad cash flow
    management is exemplified by the insolvency of Carillion, who in 2017 was the
    second-largest construction company in the UK (based on turnover); however, at
    the time of liquidation in 2018, it owed GBP 1.3 billion worth of unpaid liabilities
    to SMEs [[30](#CR30)]. From 2009 to 2018, Carillion’s debt increased from GBP
    242 million to GBP 1.3 billion; furthermore, they imposed payment terms of 120 days
    to SMEs, which is four times the duration of what is typically agreed in construction
    contracts in the UK [[31](#CR31)].

  zh: 建筑行业由少数主要承包商主导，为许多中小企业（SMEs）提供工作，这导致了SMEs之间的过度竞争，并为主要承包商提供了对供应链的控制权 [[26](#CR26)]。由于行业的等级性质，SMEs被迫接受不公平的合同条件和过长的支付期限；承包商实施*现金农场*技术和*付款时支付*条款
    [[4](#CR4)]。现金农场是承包商实施的一种策略，可以改善内部现金流，但以向供应链迟缓付款为代价，此外，它允许项目预算用于投资新工作，而不是支付未清偿债务
    [[27](#CR27)]。尽管现金农场对承包商有利，但它是SME破产的主要原因 [[28](#CR28)]。英国国家统计局的数据表明，英国建筑行业每年平均有2595起个体破产案件，占英国整体破产人口的18%，是英国所有其他行业中最高的
    [[29](#CR29)]。现金流管理不善的危险体现在卡里利安公司的破产上，该公司曾是英国第二大建筑公司（根据营业额计算）；然而，在2018年的清算时，其对中小企业欠下了13亿英镑的未支付债务
    [[30](#CR30)]。从2009年到2018年，卡里利安的债务从2.42亿英镑增加到13亿英镑；此外，他们给予中小企业120天的支付期限，是英国建筑合同中通常约定的四倍长
    [[31](#CR31)]。
- en: Dispute resolution in the construction industry is typically managed through
    mediation, which is a lightweight process that involves an impartial third party
    to manage and settle the dispute; however, large companies can enforce costlier
    methods against unsatisfactory settling, through methods such as litigation [[32](#CR32)].
    This places SMEs at a disadvantage because payments to the supply chain are withheld
    until a court settlement takes place, which can take over 12 months to process
    [[32](#CR32)]. Countries such as France and Australia include regulations that
    allow SMEs to request overdue payments directly from the client; furthermore,
    Japan includes severe governmentally enforced penalties on construction companies
    that impose unfair payment terms [[33](#CR33)].

    Building and Civil Engineering Work, discussed the importance of change in the
    payment culture of the construction industry and outlined the importance of collaborative
    contracts; however, 50 + years later, the same problems are still existent [[19](#CR19)].
    This was reiterated in the 1994 Latham report [[104](#CR104)], and the 1998 Construction
    Task Force Egan report [[105](#CR105)]. Furthermore, across 25-years, spanning
    from 1996 to 2021, the UK government published six major legislation documents
    regarding sustainable payment practices in the construction industry. Despite
    this, from 2008 to 2013, the duration of overdue payments increased by 22%, while
    bank lending for construction projects decreased by 38% [[106](#CR106)]. This
    places small and medium enterprises (SMEs) under increasing pressure to sustain
    financial adversity, due to banks increasingly refusing to provide financial support
    and construction contracts that allow for unsupportive payment conditions. For
    example, unfairly withholding supply chain payments (cash farming) and unnecessary
    processing delays caused by cascading payments down each tier of the supply chain.

  zh: 1964年的班韦尔报告，标题为《建筑和土木工程工程合同的订立和管理》，讨论了建筑行业付款文化变革的重要性，并概述了合作合同的重要性，然而，50年后，同样的问题依然存在[[19](#CR19)]。这在1994年的拉瑟姆报告[[104](#CR104)]和1998年的斯休工程任务奥尼甘报告[[105](#CR105)]中再次强调。另外，从1996年到2021年的25年间，英国政府出版了六份关于建筑行业可持续支付实践的重要立法文件。尽管如此，从2008年到2013年，逾期付款期限的持续时间增加了22％，而用于建筑项目的银行贷款减少了38％[[106](#CR106)]。这使中小企业（SMEs）承受越来越大的压力来承受金融逆境，因为银行越来越不愿提供财务支持和允许不支持的支付条件的建筑合同。例如：不公平地拖延供应链付款（现金农业）和由供应链每个层级造成的不必要的处理延迟。
- en: Building information modelling (BIM) did not provide the digital reform that
    was expected of it, which is due to many factors that are beyond the scope of
    this article to investigate; however, some of these include the culture of the
    industry to resist change, skills shortage, and cost of the technology [[107](#CR107)].
    Additionally, many of the expectations of BIM were overinflated and based on premature
    forecasting. While BIM is a construction industry-focused innovation, blockchain
    includes substantial development in other industries, which includes solutions
    adaptable to the construction industry [[108](#CR108)]. Technology leaders such
    as Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple, (FAMGA) are providing blockchain-based
    services for enterprises and consumers to integrate with existing IT systems [[109](#CR109)].
    Due to blockchain being a multi-industry innovation, it includes greater contribution
    and development from a wider community, unlike BIM, which is a construction industry-centred
    innovation.

- en: Project bank account (PBA) shares several principal characteristics with blockchains,
    such as transparency, auditability, and disintermediation, through creating a
    partitioned bank account that is co-managed by project participants. The ideation
    of the PBA blockchain model is taken from a decentralised application. It includes
    payment conditions preprogrammed into a blockchain application to automate the
    execution of payments to the supply chain. The proposed PBA blockchain model assumes
    that banks have adopted blockchain and can offer payment guarantees through tokenised
    collateral; however, the readiness of banks to provide blockchain services to
    the construction industry requires further research [[110](#CR110)]. If banks
    are reluctant to assist in providing guarantees, opportunities exist with decentralised
    finance (DeFi), and asset tokenisation through collateral-backed lending [[111](#CR111)].
    However, the technical aspect of DeFi for enterprise is in the conceptualisation
    and testing stage and requires regulatory maturity. Furthermore, insuring against
    blockchain-related risks is difficult to forecast in the current environment due
    to the nascency of the technology. This disincentivizes an already risk-averse
    construction industry. DeFi came into fruition in 2020, and in the same year,
    a USD 25 million USD hack of a DeFi platform took place, which was untraceable
    due to the pseudonymous nature of public blockchains [[112](#CR112)]. Collateral
    lending through DeFi is currently only available for peer-to-peer borrowing/lending,
    which is unsuitable for DeFi-based peer-to-business or business-to-business finance
    [[113](#CR113)].

  zh: 项目银行账户（PBA）与区块链具有几个主要特征，例如透明性、可审计性和去中心化，通过创建一个由项目参与者共同管理的分区银行账户。PBA区块链模型的构想源自一个去中心化应用。它包括预先编程在区块链应用中的支付条件，以自动执行供应链支付。拟议的PBA区块链模型假设银行已经采用了区块链技术，并可以通过代币化抵押品提供支付保证；然而，银行是否愿意为建筑行业提供区块链服务还需要进一步的研究[[110](#CR110)]。如果银行不愿意协助提供担保，DeFi和通过抵押品支持的借贷的资产代币化存在机会[[111](#CR111)]。然而，企业DeFi的技术方面尚处于概念化和测试阶段，需要监管成熟度。此外，由于技术的新生，目前很难预测区块链相关风险的保险。这不利于本已风险厌恶的建筑行业。DeFi在2020年变成现实，在同一年，发生了一起2500万美元的DeFi平台黑客攻击事件，由于公共区块链的匿名特性，此事件无法追踪到[[112](#CR112)]。通过DeFi的抵押贷款目前仅适用于点对点借贷，不适用于基于DeFi的点对企业或企业对企业金融[[113](#CR113)]。
- en: When the client approves the project budget through a signed blockchain message
    instantiated through the PBA application, this can be used as part of a promissory
    note that guarantees a level of financial certainty to the supply chain. It is
    envisaged that the client’s signed message could integrate as part of a formal
    digital document to provide legal assurance of the intention to provide good payment
    practices. Since the PBA application is off-chain, it can adapt more easily to
    contract-specific alterations or new regulations that may be imposed by GDPR.
    This can be achieved without having to obtain consensus from a large public blockchain
    network since the application is off-chain. Some of the primary risks associated
    with blockchain include incorrectly written code and hacks. If the project funds
    are stolen due to a hack, they will be almost impossible to retrieve due to the
    pseudonymous nature of user wallets on the blockchain.

- en: The proposed PBA blockchain model imposes automated loans to the client based
    on their unpaid liabilities; however, clients are likely to dispute this, as they
    are not typically penalised for overdue payments. To combat this, a small percentage
    of the project budget can be pooled to cover any overdue payment fees. If the
    client does not incur any late fees, then they would receive reimbursement at
    the handover stage. Incentives for the client to use the PBA blockchain application
    include the ability to provide payment guarantees to the supply chain, payment
    automation, and mathematical proof of good payment practices.

- en: The cost of developing the PBA blockchain application was not investigated quantitatively;
    however, the incorporation of an off-chain application provides a more economical
    alternative than having to deploy smart contracts directly on the blockchain.
    These overheads are reduced though diverting computational processing off-chain
    [[114](#CR114)]. Since the proposed application is off-chain, privacy features
    are easier to incorporate and customise; however, increased modularity is exchanged
    for a greater centralization; therefore, this tradeoff is important to consider
    when designing the security aspects of the off-chain application and the governance
    team that will be appointed to manage it.

- en: The proposed PBA blockchain model bypasses having to use smart contracts. This
    mitigates costs associated with their development, auditing, and on-chain hosting
    fees. According to Andrew Zapotochnyi, CEO of Block Geeks, which is a smart contract
    auditing and education company, the estimated cost for auditing a smart contract
    can range from USD 4000 to 100,000 each, depending on how advanced the coding
    is [[74](#CR74)]. While iOlite, a non-profit organisation for smart contract technologies,
    estimated that the cost of developing a smart contract can range from USD 7000
    to 100,000 each, based on the complexity of its business logic [[73](#CR73)].
    Furthermore, deploying smart contracts directly on the blockchain incurs hosting
    fees that need to be considered. Despite the generalised nature of these costs,
    even the lowest spectrum is uneconomically feasible, as potentially thousands
    of smart contracts would be required to fully automate payments in a construction
    project, due to the volume of participants and activities that occur in a typical
    project. Despite this, as blockchain and smart contracts mature, it is likely
    to become exponentially more affordable. Until then, other options such as off-chain
    must be explored.

  zh: 提出的PBA区块链模型规避了使用智能合约。这减轻了与它们的开发、审计和链上托管费用有关的成本。根据Block Geeks的首席执行官Andrew Zapotochnyi的说法，该公司是一家智能合约审计和教育公司，审计智能合约的估计成本可以从每个智能合约4000美元到10万美元不等，这取决于编码的先进程度[[74](#CR74)]。而非营利性智能合约技术组织iOlite估计，开发智能合约的成本可以从每个智能合约的7000美元到10万美元不等，这取决于其业务逻辑的复杂性[[73](#CR73)]。此外，直接在区块链上部署智能合约会产生需要考虑的托管费用。尽管这些成本的一般性质，即使是最低的范围也不经济可行，因为可能需要数千个智能合约才能完全自动化支付一个建筑项目，这是由于典型项目中涉及的参与者数量和活动的数量。尽管如此，随着区块链和智能合约的成熟，它可能会变得成本指数上更具实惠。在那之前，必须探索其他选择，比如离链。
- en: Due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, payments would need to be conducted
    through stablecoins or central bank digital currencies (CBDC). CBDCs are a digital
    reproduction of a national currency, issued and managed by the government; however,
    it is currently in the testing stage, with China being the first to conduct a
    full-scale pilot in 2021 [[115](#CR115)]. The Bank of England and HM Treasury
    created the CBDC taskforce in 2021 to further explore its viability as legal tender
    [[116](#CR116)]. Stablecoins are like CBDCs in that they are cryptocurrencies
    pegged at a one-to-one ratio with a national currency, such as the US dollar or
    Euro; however, they are not minted or controlled by a central bank [[117](#CR117)].
    Adoption of the PBA blockchain model is dependent on the host country having a
    stablecoin or CBDC in their national currency. Many major currencies such as USD,
    Euro, and GBP include a stablecoin variant; however, these stablecoins have a
    limited circulating supply, they also lack government regulation, and it is difficult
    for liquidity providers instantaneously converted them back into national currencies
    at a large scale.

- en: From 1996 to 2021, six major UK governmental legislative documents were published
    to address the payment problem in the construction industry. From these, the project
    bank account (PBA) strategy was identified as an area that could benefit from
    the integration of blockchain. Despite its nascency, blockchain is rapidly evolving
    and changing the outlook of how businesses, people, and services operate. In a
    report which discusses the potential impact of blockchain, it was identified as
    potentially transforming 58 industries globally, which includes the construction
    industry [[121](#CR121)]. The proposed PBA blockchain model provides a high-level
    overview of how project participants could interact with a blockchain application
    to upload payment activities, validate works, and automate the execution of liabilities
    to the supply chain. The PBA model also discussed potential blockchain solutions
    regarding how to mitigate the risk of non-payment from the client, through tokenised
    collateral that can be used as a medium of exchange with a bank, thereby allowing
    the bank to automate the execution of overdue payments in exchange for collateral.
