- en: Blockchain can make trade fairer. In this context, ‘Fair Trade’ means ensuring
    that producers are paid fairly, and work in conditions that are safe and humane,
    and that consumers can be guaranteed the origins and quality of the products they
    consume. These requirements imply notions of social responsibility. For the purposes
    of this discussion, this chapter focuses on trade in agricultural produce and
    extracted minerals. Issues around how Blockchain might solve Wicked Problems in
    other areas of trade are either dealt with directly elsewhere in this book or
    may be applied by analogy.

    are the product of six years of research conducted by Harvard Professor John Ruggie
    [274]. They are based on 47 consultations and site visits in more than 20 countries,
    and involve governments, companies, business associations, civil society, and
    investors. According to Oxfam, they are an authoritative global reference point
    for business and human rights, and they implement ethical trade by ensuring that
    governments and companies have a collective responsibility to protect human rights
    in business enterprises. Most of the work done by the UN to ensure that these
    rights are recognised and upheld around the world is conducted by the International
    Labour Organization (ILO).

    of workers throughout the world. Its focus for the past 100 years has been to
    address issues such as excessive working hours, unemployment, minimum age, and
    work for women. Fair Trade seeks to ensure that the ethical standards for employment
    conditions articulated by the UN and the ILO are the minimum working conditions
    of all participants in the production of food and consumer goods. It is in this
    frame that the term ‘ethical’ is used in this book.

    without the fruits of those resources benefiting the country’s citizens, then
    hardship and insecurity will set in. These vulnerable populations are easy to
    exploit: their needs are basic and immediate. Meanwhile, the business models of
    corporate companies and large organisations in developed countries reward those
    who can make a profit. Profits are needed to satisfy shareholders and the rewards
    to senior executives of multinationals who return large annual profits for the
    organisations run to the millions. This business model incentivises the pressure
    that companies put on producers and service providers to agree to rock-bottom
    prices. Whether they are buying coffee beans from Nigeria or having their shoes
    manufactured in Vietnam, businesses are often focused on delivering higher returns
    to wealthy owners, top executives, and shareholders, while failing to ensure equitable
    distribution of profits along the supply chain. Indeed, the relationship between

    control production, supply, demand, and consumption price by operating at both
    ends of the process, by directly taxing or subsidising goods and services, by
    regulating the use of goods and services, and by structuring domestic markets

    of its certified products drop 4% in 2014 [289]. This was its first fall in sales
    since inception in 2004\. So, what is going on? Analysts point to two reasons
    for this decline: the increasing popularity of cheap supermarkets, which do not
    participate in the Fair Trade market; and the rise of ethical labelling. The ethical
    labelling movement is directly in competition with Fair Trade and it has caused
    some damage to the Fair Trade brand. Ethical labelling aims to create more choice
    in the market for consumers about the way that produce is grown and shipped to
    the marketplace. With Fair Trade labels, the most recognised in the ethical consumer
    market, it is hard to imagine a movement that would attempt to undermine its foothold.
    However, there is criticism of Fair Trade that is fuelling a new ethical labelling
    movement. Some recent audits of ‘Fair Trade’ certified producers conducted by
    third parties have revealed instances of uneven distribution of higher wages and
    better working conditions. Some argue the Fair Trade products are not always the
    best quality, which suggests that certification is not being awarded on merit
    [289].'

  zh: 尽管Fair Trade有着良好的初衷并且有很多支持者，但2014年英国对其认证产品的消费下降了4% [289]。这是自2004年成立以来首次出现销售下滑。那么，究竟发生了什么呢？分析师指出，这次下滑有两个原因：一是廉价超市的日益流行，这些超市并未参与Fair
    Trade市场；二是道德标签的兴起。道德标签运动与Fair Trade直接竞争，对Fair Trade品牌造成了一些损害。道德标签旨在为消费者在市场上提供更多关于产品种植和运输方式的选择。有了Fair
    Trade标签，这是道德消费者市场上最知名的，很难想象会有一个运动试图破坏它的立足点。然而，对Fair Trade的批评正在推动新的道德标签运动的产生。一些第三方对“Fair
    Trade”认证生产商的近期审计发现，存在高工资和更好工作条件的不均等分配情况。一些人认为，Fair Trade产品并不总是最好的质量，这表明认证并非基于成绩

    is regarded as another controlling mechanism (albeit well intentioned) and has
    been described as a kind of neo-imperialism [290]. The counterpoint to the terms
    and conditions imposed by Fair Trade advocates and certifiers is the notion that
