- en: Before my election to Parliament in 2017, I must confess that my knowledge of
    Blockchain technology was underdeveloped. Of course, I knew of cryptocurrencies
    – who didn't? Stories of people trading Bitcoin and making huge fortunes and losses
    were and continue to be widely reported. I certainly had little appreciation of
    the enormous importance of the Blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies and
    how it has the potential to radically change our society. It may seem surprising,
    therefore, to find myself as the chairman of an exciting and active APPG in the
    heart of UK politics.

  zh: 在我2017年当选为国会议员之前，我必须承认我对区块链技术的了解不够充分。当然，我知道加密货币——谁不知道呢？人们买卖比特币并因此赚取巨额财富和亏损的故事，一直是广为报道的焦点。我确实没有充分认识到加密货币背后的区块链技术的重要性，以及它改变我们社会的巨大潜力。因此，我自己担任英国政治中心一个激动人心且活跃的APPG的主席，可能让人觉得有些意外。
- en: The reason behind my decision to set up the APPG was simple – I wanted to make
    government more efficient and believed that Blockchain was an opportunity to achieve
    this. A chance conversation with a colleague who was waxing lyrical about Blockchain
    technology got me intrigued, and I knew I had to act, thus the APPG for Blockchain
    was established.

  zh: 我决定成立APPG的原因很简单——我想让政府变得更加高效，并认为区块链是一个实现这一目标的机会。与一位对区块链技术赞不绝口的同仁的偶然交谈引发了我的兴趣，我知道我必须采取行动，于是APPG区块链小组成立了。
- en: In seeking to make a worthy contribution I wanted to establish a group that
    reached out to experts. Facilitated by the Big Innovation Centre, our first meeting
    received an overwhelming attendance. It was at this meeting that I met the author
    of this book, Antony Welfare, who became a board advisor to the APPG.

  zh: 为了做出有价值的贡献，我想建立一个向专家伸出援手的组织。在大型创新中心的帮助下，我们的第一次会议得到了空前的参与。正是在这次会议上，我遇到了本书的作者安东尼·惠利，他成为了APPG的董事会顾问。
- en: Antony's enthusiasm for the possibilities of Blockchain technology on many areas
    from the economy, industry, and society is profound. It is this enthusiasm and
    characteristically easy-to-understand style that makes this book such an invaluable
    resource.

  zh: 安东尼对区块链技术在经济学、工业、社会等多个领域可能带来的影响充满热情。正是这种热情和他特有的易于理解的风格，使得这本书成为了一笔宝贵的资源。
- en: In a world where there is much contention around data and who controls it, this
    book clearly asserts how this can work in favour of the consumer. Key to this
    are the constant themes of openness and transparency, and the persuasive argument
    that if we want to see the benefits of this technology then we must embrace change.

  zh: 在一个围绕数据及其控制权产生大量争议的世界里，这本书清楚地阐述了如何让这一切有利于消费者。其中关键的不断主题是开放和透明度，以及一个有说服力的论点：如果我们想看到这项技术的益处，我们就必须拥抱变革。
- en: A leader in retail with a wide range of experience, Antony takes the reader
    on a journey. This is made all the more vivid by his use of his fictional retailer
    the ‘Antony Stores Group’ to illustrate the use cases. The ‘how’ and ‘why’ we
    would use Blockchain help the reader to visualize the real potential of this technology.
