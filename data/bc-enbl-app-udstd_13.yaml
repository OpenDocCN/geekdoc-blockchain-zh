    : So John, can you tell our readers about your background, and what made you interested
    in building health care startups?John Bass : Many of us in the health care technology
    industry have spent our professional lives working to build applications and intelligence
    that helps stakeholders (providers, vendors, payers, consumers, etc.) understand
    the opportunities to improve care delivery and curb costs. As a community, we
    have a hope that we can change the system; that we can make an unfair system fair
    again; that, using technology, we can go back to a place where health care is
    centered on the individual consumer patient rather than the corporate interest.
    We all dream of the ever-elusive health care platform that captures the hearts
    and minds of patients, builds the network effects, and makes everything better.
    We dream of saving our country from runaway health costs, a national security
    issue of our own making. We dream about delivering care to the millions of people
    who struggle with access. We dream of creating something so viral that it scales
    globally and helps millions of people around the world get the care they need.
    We want it so bad we lose sleep. We want it so bad we abandon our families for
    weeks at a time, hoping to light the fuse.Vikram : What got you started thinking
    about building a blockchain-based health care company?John : The startups I have
    been a part of have all focused on Web-based products that promoted collaboration,
    data sharing, shared workflows, and cross-enterprise clinical or financial performance.
    Our teams have built B2B platforms, patient portals, collaborative workflow solutions,
    surgical performance solutions, and other trendy IT solutions that I thought would
    change the industry. These efforts, like most of the solutions you see at the
    big health care technology trade shows, focus on adding applications on top of
    the existing infrastructure. They essentially support the existing health care
    value chains, with the goal of making them more efficient. Although successful
    at solving problems, it’s clear that these years of work and millions of dollars
    have little impact on the macro cost and quality issues facing our country. The
    killer app and the platform are still out there.After 20 years I have realized
    that there is a more fundamental problem that can’t be fixed through additive
    technologies. Step back and you see that, over time, we have built a system that
    is more and more dependent on middle men, relational databases, and their associated
    applications. The structural truth is clear to me now. The structural truth is
    the driver of unstable economic trends, unfair access, failures in preventable
    illness, suboptimal outcomes, rising out-of-pocket costs, and medical debt. All
    systems inherit the characteristics of their container, which in the United States
    is a fee-for-service marketplace that lacks any sort of rational, free-market
    characteristics. Anything built within this container is constrained by those
    characteristics. I don’t believe we can really solve anything building within
    the existing container.Vikram : I think we would both agree that the existing
    container has worked well for now, but it’s not resilient enough to work for the
    problems that we will be facing in the near future. What are your thoughts on
    this?John : Don’t get me wrong … the U.S. health system has been remarkably successful.
    More people die of old age than infectious disease. We have become experts at
    treating acute-care injuries and illnesses. Our pharmaceuticals industry produced
    a vaccine to Zika in a remarkably short amount of time. I would not say our system
    is broken or in need of a do-over. It is working exactly as we designed it to
    work. It is a representation of the user stories and requirements that we drew
    up for its developers. People from around the world travel to the United States
    to receive world-class treatment. And we are rapidly exporting our (good and bad)
    expertise to the rest of the world.What is clear is that we are no longer getting
    our money’s worth. The United States is approaching $5 trillion in spending and
    one third is waste. Medical errors are the third leading cause of mortality behind
    heart disease and cancer. Significant populations of people in the United States
    and around the world have poor access to care. We all live in environments where
    unhealthy influences, such as the consumption of sugar, have been institutionalized.
    Yesterday’s system we created was not designed to counterbalance the behaviors
    that have emerged as the leading causes of today’s cost and quality concerns.
    We are realizing that can’t be fixed with new applications on top of the as-designed
    system. We have to rebuild, taking advantage of our successes while optimizing
    for today’s social and economic truths.Vikram : So what does the rebuild look
    like? What are the new user stories and requirements? Who are the new developers
    of this system? Can the current corporate interests be trusted to redesign a platform
    for the future? How do we get from here to there?John: Hashed Health sees the
    blockchain as the protocol for the next generation of health solutions. By moving
    trust to the protocol layer, we lay the foundation for leaner, more agile care
    delivery models, payment systems, value chains, and consumer experiences. It is
    not the answer to these questions. It allows innovators to have a new conversation
    free of today’s limiting factors. When combined with IoT, machine learning, artificial
    intelligence, cryptocurrency, design thinking, and other tools, blockchain becomes
    a recipe for true disruption.The path to real change in health care is through
    the consumer. One reason blockchain is an enabler of disruption in health care
    lies in its potential to change the consumer’s relationship with existing systems
    of health and wellness. It provides an alternative to today’s corporate-focused
    environment that has become a limiting factor for society. Users will interact
    with this new model through their mobile devices, which will leverage “wallet”
    software that will become more and more self-sovereign over time. Consumers will
    become prosumers with controls over their health assets. Patients will no longer
    be asked to join a series of siloed patient portals as they move through the continuum
    of care. This provides a more holistic approach across an individual’s related
    health, wellness, social, and socioeconomic events. We have learned that one’s
    health is so much more than the 5 percent fragments that happen during a clinical
    visit. Patients will be empowered to control their information and have the ability
    to donate or monetize their records as they wish. Over time, honeypots of medical
    records data will be decentralized and distributed, making the user’s information
    less susceptible to theft.Vikram : By many standards, health care IT moves as
    a slow monolith. This might be due to design, but can you talk a bit more about
    why we don’t have a straightforward consumer-to-provider relationship in health
    IT, and health care more broadly?John : The consumer-facing side of health IT
    is complicated. Consumerization of health care has been a buzzword for years now
    but has proven elusive. There are a few important reasons why this is true. First,
    on many levels, health care is not like other markets. Health care is not a traditional
    commodity or service to be purchased. Even if they were completely free to do
    so (more on this later), consumers are not in a position to make the best judgments
    about purchasing health care, either because of the complexity of health care
    treatments or due to the emergent need to seek care. Additionally, unlike almost
    all other products or services, a consumer cannot always predict the results of
    consuming health care. For example, purchasing a car produces predictable results:
    owning transportation equipment with stated features and in regulatory compliance.
    By contrast, a given treatment might or might not adequately address the illness
    or condition.Beyond these economic basics, consumerization is complicated by the
    configuration of the health care system itself. The drive to “Uber-ize” health
    care runs head-on into the wall of the U.S. payment and delivery systems. The
    consumer has no knowledge of price for services. Providers themselves often cannot
    give pricing in advance. Furthermore, the consumer is not a party to the pricing
    agreement, as the contractual relationship is between the provider and the payor,
    on behalf of the consumer. These are all well-known, almost hackneyed issues related
    to U.S. health care. By themselves, they do not prevent the creation of potentially
    useful consumer tools. Instead, to have utility, consumer tools need to “plug
    in” to the systems that deliver and pay for health care services. Given the dizzying
    array of providers, payors, and service providers, as well as their oft-conflicting
    motivations, consumer tools are often stymied by the unwillingness of enterprises
    that control the health care marketplace. Consumerization of health care is elusive,
    not because of a lack of tools, but rather due to the lack of an open platform.As
    groups of consumers organize or are convened in traditional and innovative ways,
    these groups will represent new centers of gravity for the future marketplace.
    The community or group (however you define it: village, employer, values-based
    group, nursing home, etc.) will also be empowered through the ability to organize,
    aggregate, and share. Similarly, groups of providers on the sell-side of the marketplace
    will organize (or be convened) into either traditional or innovative new cohorts
    for the provision of care in ways that are better, faster, and more economically
    rational than what can be delivered under today’s bloated market structure.Vikram
    : How do you think the large enterprises (provider groups and insurance companies)
    will evolve to respond to the new opportunities such as blockchain?John : Enterprises
    will, over time, be affected by new opportunities and challenges that result from
    changing market structures. The effects will be felt throughout today’s health
    care value chains, such as supply chain, revenue cycle, claims life cycle, clinical
    research, insurance and benefits, and clinical episodes. Audit and compliance
    activities will fall away to automation. Contracting, rebating, administrative
    fees, and discounting schemes will disappear or be transformed through the use
    of immutable, transparent shared ledgers. Closed relational databases like EMRs,
    ERPs, and materials management systems will evolve as the nature of their accounting
    functions move to the market level. Clinical trials programs will be optimized
    through sharing of information and streamlined administrative processes. Security
    will be enhanced and, over time, data honeypots will fall away to a decentralized
    structure.Companies will not throw away their existing databases (at least not
    at first). First, these legacy systems will transact with the blockchain through
    APIs and then, over time, we will begin to see new, nimble, ground-up systems
    emerge. These systems will transform how we currently think about the movement
    of health, data, clinical, and financial assets across a market.Machines will
    also begin to play a larger role in health and wellness. We already see a role
    for connected health machines, wearables, and a host of Web-enabled monitoring
    devices. Blockchain provides the foundation for a more secure and scalable health
    IoT environment. Devices can be registered and validated more scalably using the
    blockchain as a shared ledger. As a result, information from these machines can
    be trusted. Transfer of ownership can also be tracked more easily and the operational
    life cycle of the device can be recorded. Perhaps most interestingly, the device
    itself can be given a wallet and a set of smart contracts that allow it to execute
    commands, transfer assets, and operate in ways that drive clinical and financial
    value for consumers or for the machines themselves!This vision of the consumer,
    the community, the enterprise, and the machine is truly disruptive. It’s also
    a vision with many technical and nontechnical challenges.Vikram : How do we get
    to the future that you described? What is the path to the consumer-driven future?
    How do we create demonstrations that prove the value of the technology? How do
    we get people on board?John : Health care is a fast-follower. It is historically
    resistant to platforms and “uberization” because of regulatory considerations,
    complexity, and aversion to risk. Blockchain technology is new. Satoshi Nakamoto
    released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2009\. Ethereum was created in the summer of
    2015\. Other protocols being considered for health care projects, such as Hyperledger
    Fabric, Tendermint, and other protocols, are even newer. EOS, Tezos, and NEO just
    arrived on the scene with their record-setting token sales and new ideas around
    governance, consensus, and scalability. Smart contracts are still not very smart
    and are even less secure. It’s anyone’s guess who the winners will be in five
    to ten years. If given the choice, the chefs in health care’s institutional kitchen
    would prefer to sit back and watch the technology marinate for a while.The real
    limiting factor may actually be the nontechnical concerns. First, for blockchain
    solutions to be effective, you need a collaborative network of participants. This
    is why you read so much about consortia and blockchain. Without the consortium
    or the minimally viable network of participants, enterprise blockchain efforts
    are merely expensive academic exercises. Even if you have the network required,
    successful governance can be tricky. These collaborative concepts require some
    getting used to for some, a paradigm shift for most. Second, for certain use cases
    there are serious regulatory concerns that complicate productive use. Many great
    ideas will be limited by a regulatory framework that never imagined the decentralized
    marketplace. Third, there is still a significant amount of education and organization
    of the market required. After a year of operating our consortium, the majority
    of the market still needs consulting on what blockchain is, how it could affect
    their market structure, and why networks are key to success. Fourth, we believe
    that the early efforts to establish blockchain and distributed ledger technologies
    as a viable solution will require simple demonstations of value. These early demonstrations
    will not be designed to change the world. They will solve simple, unsexy problems
    in today’s health system. As a result, there will be early complaints that these
    products do not deliver the value that blockchain had originally promised.It will
    take some time to sort things out. For those of us who are early in the health
    care blockchain space, these are the complicated realities we face. The real question
    is timing.Vikram: So, about the timing, how long do you think it will take for
    blockchain to become mainstream? How can we accelerate the time it takes to cross
    the chasm?John: I often tell people that starting Hashed Health is the most excited
    and the most scared I have been in my professional career. From an innovator’s
    perspective, the blockchain health care space is a dream. There is no template.
    Everything is new. The technology is new and immature. The collaborative innovation
    business model is new. The concept of “fat protocols” is new. We have to not only
    build products, we also have to build a market. We are innovating from every angle.
    Every day is a 3D chess match. It’s high-risk, high-reward research and development.
    For Hashed, it’s the most exciting opportunity imaginable.We chose the collaborative
    business model because it is in line with the spirit of the blockchain and it
    seemed like the only path to success when we started the company in 2016\. Unlike
    previous startups, this was not a “build a product, sell a product” model. Although
    we had many strong use cases in the queue, we knew we could not place all our
    bets on one. The market wasn’t ready. We knew we needed to do more with less.
    The collaborative model allows for us to join together with industry thought leaders
    who can contribute to our ecosystems of shared value. By being a part of several
    successful projects with the companies that are using the products, we increase
    our odds that our products will gain productive use. We also lower the risks and
    increase the rewards for our customers. It was the only way, especially in a new
    and complex market.Once we made this decision, we were quickly branded a consortium.
    We have never been comfortable with this label, although we struggled to come
    up with anything better. We are more like a mesh network or a product studio.
    At the end of the day, Hashed Health is a products company with many successful
    solutions in our portfolio. In many ways, any company building blockchain products
    is a consortium if they want to be successful. The network is often more important
    than the product itself. It’s the relationship between the two where we spend
    a lot of our energy, because that’s where success lies.Vikram: So how do we start
    building the network? Currently, there is a lack of awareness and understanding
    in the health care space about blockchain technology. How do we bring the providers
    up to speed and get them interested?John: To begin, we knew we needed to do a
    lot of thought leadership work to educate and organize the industry. We researched
    the technology heavily and we connected what was happening outside health care
    to our professional and personal health care experience. We invested heavily in
    research. After a time, we began our thought leadership work. We blogged, wrote
    newsletters, and spoke at conferences. We listened to the feedback we received
    and we iterated on our ideas and early products. We used those early products
    to recruit the initial members. At first we developed really complicated contracts,
    and then we simplified them to make getting started as easy as possible. We evolved
    into a structure that can flex governance, business, and technical requirements
    as needed based on the workgroup and the product. This allows us to meet a customer
    where they are, rather than forcing them down a contractual pathway that might
    be scary or uncomfortable. We started with larger organizations and we are now
    opening membership and workgroup activities up to earlier stage companies, universities,
    entrepreneurs, and thought leaders so that we can bring more contributors into
    the emerging networks.Vikram: Can you talk a bit more about how the Hashed Health
    model benefits the members? What’s the current structure of Hashed Health?John
    : Our goal with our members is to build community and products that make meaningful
    use of the strengths of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. We seek
    out members who will contribute to a project and a conversation, not just look
    to extract value from the group. We consider ourselves a health care company first,
    so the projects we work on must have the patients’ best interests in mind.Our
    members usually engage as general members who need some consulting before they
    are ready to build. The level of business and technical expertise inside health
    care institutions is very weak, so a consultative approach is required. Members
    usually have a concept or two that they believe they’d like to tackle, but they
    always require some guidance and some preparation prior to development. By providing
    health care expertise and blockchain expertise, we are able to deliver a unique
    product that drives productive use case concepts forward in a more efficient manner.
    By creating collaborative agreements, we can build incentives that support accomplishing
    rational milestones on the pathway from concept to productive use.Each of our
    networks has its own constituents, cadence, business plan, technical plan, governance
    structure, and personality. Each is focused on solving a specific business problem,
    and we choose the protocol that fits the business need. Currently we have built
    products and demos on Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, a commercial platform called
    BitSE, and Tendermint and Ethermint. We are currently researching other protocols
    and various middleware products including Gem, Bloq, Nuco, Stratumn, Tezos, EOS,
    and IOTA. The workgroups all share common learning and best practices that translate
    across projects. We have experts (either in house or contracted) who can support
    any discussion (technical, business, legal, regulatory) required to advance a
    product.To cross the chasm, we feel it is important to begin with simple demonstrations
    of value. The simpler the better. We prefer projects that are not highly political,
    that do not require protected information, and that solve a problem in today’s
    environment while laying the foundation for our vision of the future.Vikram :
    Let’s get into the portfolio of operational working groups within Hashed Health
    and the current target areas. Can you elaborate on some of the use -cases for
    us and how they’re using the blockchain?John : At the time of writing, Hashed
    Health has five active enterprise groups.'

    Web 的产品。我们的团队建立了 B2B 平台、患者门户、协作工作流解决方案、外科绩效解决方案以及其他时髦的 IT 解决方案，我认为这些解决方案会改变行业。这些努力，就像你在大型医疗技术交易展会上看到的大多数解决方案一样，都是专注于在现有基础设施之上添加应用程序。它们基本上支持现有的医疗价值链，目的是使其更加高效。尽管成功解决了问题，但很明显，这些年的工作和数百万美元的投入对我们国家面临的宏观成本和质量问题几乎没有影响。杀手级应用程序和平台仍然存在。二十年来，我意识到存在一个更基本的问题，无法通过增量技术解决。退一步看，你会发现，随着时间的推移，我们构建了一个越来越依赖于中间商、关系型数据库及其相关应用程序的系统。结构性真相现在对我来说是清楚的。结构性的真相是不稳定经济趋势的驱动因素，不公平的访问、可预防疾病的失败、次优的结果、不断上涨的自费成本和医疗债务。所有系统都继承了它们的容器的特征，在美国，这个容器是一个缺乏任何合理自由市场特征的按服务计费的市场。在这个容器内构建的任何东西都受到这些特征的限制。我不相信我们真的可以通过在现有容器内构建来解决任何问题。维克拉姆：我认为我们都会同意，现有的容器目前运作良好，但是它对我们将在不久的将来面临的问题并不够弹性。对此，你有什么想法？约翰：别误会了……美国的医疗系统取得了显著的成功。老年人的死亡人数超过了传染病。我们已经成为治疗急性伤害和疾病的专家。我们的制药行业在极短的时间内就生产出了寨卡疫苗。我不会说我们的系统是破碎的或需要重新设计。它正按照我们设计的方式正常运作。它是我们为开发人员制定的用户故事和要求的体现。世界各地的人们都会来美国接受世界一流的治疗。我们迅速将我们（好的和坏的）专业知识输出到世界其他地方。明显的是，我们再也没有得到我们应得的价值。美国的支出已接近

    The general membership dues support the initial business case and technical research.
    Once there is a decision to build, customers are required to enter a secondary
    development agreement specific to the project.Perhaps the most popular example
    of our work is decentralized physician identity. Provider identity and its related
    data is foundational to the delivery of care today and in the future. From graduate
    medical education to stat licensing, medical staff credentialing, and payer contracting,
    the ready availability and reliability of data about a provider’s identity, credentials,
    and reputation are paramount to ensuring patient safety and high-quality care.
    Globally, the world is facing a shortage of qualified health workers. That shortage
    is estimated to be 7.9 million and it is expected to grow to 12.9 million health
    workers by 2035\. A crucial challenge amidst this shortage is the ability to identify,
    locate, and communicate with workers in remote locations. The single provider’s
    identity is a complex tangle of data points. There are multiple elements held
    by multiple disparate stakeholders, such as medical schools, state licensing boards,
    and more. Some elements remain static over time (e.g., graduate degree), and others
    are dynamic over time (e.g., licensure, affiliation, residence, and contact information).In
    this use case, we treat data fields as individual data assets. Providers and credentialing
    stakeholders jointly manage a distributed provider profile registry. Cryptographic
    signatures ensure primary source verification of essential credentials and certifications,
    allowing distributed networks to share real-time updates of crucial data. This
    process significantly reduces time, expense, and wasteful manual processes that
    happen today. This use case is attractive because it is fairly straightforward
    technically, it is not political, the data are not sensitive, and no key stakeholder
    has a competitive interest. We would argue that it is a good blockchain use case
    because provider identity is not centralized and there are currently trust and
    incentive issues that need to be overcome. Although there are current efforts
    underway to centralize this information, the various data elements are not centrally
    granted, administered, or consumed. An easily auditable market-level data structure
    will deliver trust and efficiency in a market that currently has neither.In this
    example, you can see how Hashed Health has seeded a market with a simple product
    built on a simple, yet impactful use case. Blockchain allows us to tackle this
    problem in a way that was not previously imaginable.We are equally excited about
    our other foundational use cases. We are working with providers on patient registration
    authority products. We are working with a multiconstituent workgroup on an exciting
    payments model that links payments to benefits and behavior. We are working with
    government institutions on public health surveillance and clinical trials decentralization.
    We have begun an exciting journey that continues to pick up momentum, new ideas,
    and additional expertise in both blockchain and specific health care subject matter.Vikram
    : One major problem with blockchain integration into health care is concerns about
    privacy. Blockchain was designed to be anonymized, but for health data, we need
    this interesting combination of trusted miners, completely private transactions,
    and yet network consensus on the blockchain. What are your thoughts on the evolution
    of privacy?John : We are the first to admit that health care is just getting started
    and things are not perfect at this early stage. A good example of the immaturity
    is evident in the conversations we have around public vs. private blockchains.
    The key distinction is that whereas permissioned blockchains are merely distributed
    solutions, open blockchains offer real decentralization . From a technical perspective,
    we choose the protocol based on the problem we are solving. We are comfortable
    with the concept of the blockchain actually representing a spectrum of trust-based
    transactional systems ranging from open and decentralized to private and distributed.
    We believe that the industry will move toward open and public blockchains, but
    it might take time to get there. Health care enterprises, much like financial
    services and other enterprises, value greater levels of control and, perhaps most
    important, levels of confidentiality that currently are not possible on open,
    truly decentralized blockchains. It is indisputable that for a range of business
    use cases, permissioned blockchains are an ideal fit. We believe it will take
    time for companies to become comfortable with the more traditional blockchain
    models, even though it’s clear those models offer the greatest security.It is
    important to critically examine where this preference for control can become a
    damaging and self-defeating prejudice. Open and decentralized blockchains are
    continuing to explode onto the scene. The top two cryptocurrencies alone account
    for $65 billion in market capitalization. Further, the newer trend of initial
    coin offerings (ICOs) have attracted over $1 billion via crowdfunding for mostly
    open source, decentralized blockchain platforms. The overwhelming level of interest
    in and financial backing for these open platforms cannot be ignored, nor should
    they be. They signal a massive opportunity for both individuals and businesses
    to think differently about the concepts of ownership, control of the network,
    and funding for infrastructure that supports the common good. This could be very
    important in funding platforms that challenge the current corporatocracy. In health
    care, we could fund massive public infrastructure projects that put the power
    of health and wellness in the hands of the true customers. That’s powerful and
    it’s hard to imagine how that would get funded through traditional means.Setting
    aside technical issues of confidential transactions and PHI on blockchains, the
    prospect of health care businesses operating on open networks is truly daunting
    to many businesses. Centralization, consolidation, and ever-widening control of
    health care networks has been the dominant business strategy for the industry
    for decades, especially since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act. Business
    success in health care has primarily come from ever greater control of value chains
    focusing on covered lives, pharmaceuticals, claims, specialty networks, outpatient
    facilities, and supplies. It is clear that too much value is being extracted by
    value chain participants today. An open blockchain solution exposes these relationships
    and forces reintermediation with lighter, more nimble value-adding actors. The
    uncomfortable question that blockchain technology poses for the health care industry
    is the unconventional yet tangible opportunities that open, decentralized networks
    offer for true value-added health care services.Vikram : As the blockchain matures,
    where do you see the main value being created? We spoke earlier about the fat
    protocols creating and capturing value at the architecture level, but what about
    the network?John : In today’s health care industry, owning and operating the network
    is the ultimate business goal. The consumers of health care services have very
    little market power with choices limited by arcane and opaque contractual relationships
    that define today’s health care networks. They cannot assemble their own networks
    of providers and services; they cannot negotiate on price or other value-added
    services. Instead consumers are “steered.” But an open, decentralized market for
    health care services would enable the consumer be free to make rational economic
    decisions. An open network has to be free of the perverse incentives that constrain
    choice and drive patient steerage. The essential difference between the status
    quo and the promise of decentralized networks is this: Running a decentralized
    network is not a business in and of itself.So far health care has resisted the
    platform movement. In a short period of time we have watched as Uber, Airbnb,
    and others have disrupted several traditional industries. Health care leaders
    have watched those markets change with some comfort in the reality that their
    existing health care value chains are too complex, too regulated, and too sensitive
    to failure. Resting on these assumptions might be a mistake. The costs are becoming
    unsustainable and consumers are demanding another door.Open blockchain platforms
    are a new reality that health care needs to recognize and embrace. Hashed Health
    plans to move in this direction and will continue to promote open solutions. These
    systems, protocols, and tools are maturing rapidly and will not go away. They
    are proving their economic viability. The platform itself is built on open source
    software. Organizations such as nonprofit foundations now have the means to raise
    sufficient funds to launch these platforms. Incentive and fee structures can be
    implemented to fund ongoing operations, making the platform truly self-sufficient.
    The core blockchain innovation of decentralized networks supporting common transactional
    systems can keep the platform in the centralized control of any single entity.
    Open governance models continue to be refined.Value on open networks is defined
    purely by economic fundamentals of the services being offered. By contrast, the
    closed ecosystems of the health care industry seem to thrive on distorting true
    value by constraining choices. Tremendous cost and expensive administrative inefficiencies
    are in some sense a necessity designed to amass control over the network itself.
    By giving up control of the basic platform itself, health care enterprises can
    be economically rewarded by providing valued services with much lower burden of
    overhead and administrative cost.The most important point is that open decentralized
    networks are not fundamentally incompatible with health care, despite privacy
    and regulatory concerns. Technical barriers will soon give way to innovations
    such as “zero-knowledge proofs” and other means of executing confidential blockchain
    transactions. The true barrier is an entrenched business mind-set that will become
    obsolete in time. It is not a matter of if, but when open health care networks
    will take root. In the short term, we need private networks to demonstrate value
    and move the conversation forward. Hashed will be a leader in developing these
    networks as a step-wise approach to the eventual reality that open blockchains
    will deliver the most disruptive and effective solutions. It is those enterprises
    that can give up white-knuckled control of the networks that will reap the greatest
    opportunity.Vikram : Finally, I have to ask you about the recent ICO craze. Every
    blockchain company is trying to do an ICO, which reminds me of the late 1990s
    environment. Is Hashed Health going to do an ICO? What and how will the tokens
    be used?John : We have also developed expertise in tokenization, and we believe
    that one or more of our products will have a meaningful, token-centric architecture.
    The concept of a token offering is exciting because it has the potential to fund
    infrastructure concepts for public health. Designed effectively, tokens can also
    help deliver on the promise of intelligent value exchange in health care. Programmable
    payments are an incredible opportunity to improve how money flows in health care
    today, creating better incentive structures that result in the alignment we have
    been missing for so long, especially when it comes to physician and patient behavior.
    Dr. Rasu Shrestha said it well: “At the end of the day, innovation is really about
    behavior change, whether it’s a clinician putting in an order, that radiologist
    making a specific diagnosis or call on a finding, or the patient making a decision
    to eat that muffin versus going for that salad. Innovation is about behavior change”
    (see [https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/article/upmc-s-rasu-shrestha-innovation-about-behavior-change-technology-should-be-invisible](https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/article/upmc-s-rasu-shrestha-innovation-about-behavior-change-technology-should-be-invisible)
    ).We are in no rush to jump into the ICO craze, preferring to take our time and
    make sure the token mechanism is integral to the product and the token sale is
    offered in a way that satisfies the interests of our constituents while getting
    the token into the hands of those who will use it. No one can ignore the power
    of this innovation. A team of engineers anywhere in the world can make available
    a secure financial system with clear benefits over what exists today. It’s a model
    that makes it difficult for traditional systems and conventionally funded startups
    to compete.We feel confident that several of our use cases and pending partnerships
    have tokenization opportunities. We see tokens as a new, better container than
    what we have today. We are extremely interested in and excited by the emerging
    relationship between companies and tokens in the health industry. We are also
    interested to see if we can apply our same collaborative principles to the token
    distribution concept, especially in the areas of governance and coordination models.The
    value that Hashed Health delivers is simple and necessary at this stage of market
    and product building. We are a health care company first, which means we have
    the patient as our primary consideration. Our team averages 15 years in health
    care technology. We know health care and we are able to connect challenges in
    health care with the possibilities of blockchain. This means we are really good
    at health care blockchain use cases. Second, in a world where the technology is
    changing rapidly, we do not lock customers into a specific technology. Not every
    protocol or middleware solution is perfect for a specific business problem. At
    Hashed, the protocol supports the problem. Third, our collaborative approach lowers
    the risk and increases the likelihood of success for projects. The “build it and
    they will come” model results in an expensive academic exercise. There’s a better
    path where you can distribute the costs and the rewards across a network of collaborators
    who are organized around success. We have created a company and a business model
    that fits the spirit of the decentralized health solutions we build. Together
    we will innovate and together we will accelerate the meaningful productive use
    and realize the potential of blockchain in health care.'

    2035 年增长至 1290 万医护人员。在这种短缺之中一个至关重要的挑战是识别，定位和与偏远地区的工作人员沟通的能力。单个提供者的身份是一组复杂的数据点。由多个不同利益相关者持有多个要素，例如医学院，州立牌照委员会等。一些元素随时间保持不变（例如，毕业学位），而其他元素随时间变化（例如，许可证，隶属关系，居住地和联系信息）。在这个用例中，我们将数据字段视为单独的数据资产。提供者和证明股东共同管理分布式提供者配置文件注册表。加密签名确保对基本证书和认证的主要来源进行验证，允许分布式网络共享关键数据的实时更新。这个过程大大减少了目前发生的时间，费用和浪费性手动流程。这个用例很吸引人，因为它在技术上相当简单，它不是政治性的，数据不是敏感的，并且没有关键利益相关者有竞争性利益。我们认为它是一个很好的区块链用例，因为提供者身份不是集中的，并且目前存在需要克服的信任和激励问题。虽然当前正在进行努力集中这些信息，但各种数据要素并未集中授予，管理或使用。易于审计的市场级数据结构将在当前既没有信任也没有效率的市场中提供信任和效率。在这个例子中，您可以看到
    Hashed Health 如何在一个简单的产品上种下了一个市场，这个产品建立在一个简单但有影响的用例上。区块链使我们能够以以前无法想象的方式解决这个问题。我们同样对我们的其他基础用例感到兴奋。我们正在与提供者合作开发患者注册管理产品。我们正在与一个多方利益相关者工作组合作，制定一个有关将付款与福利和行为联系起来的令人兴奋的支付模型。我们正在与政府机构合作开展公共卫生监测和临床试验分散化工作。我们已经开始了一段令人兴奋的旅程，这段旅程在区块链和特定医疗保健主题方面不断增长，新的想法和额外的专业知识。Vikram:
    区块链整合到医疗保健中的一个主要问题是对隐私的担忧。区块链的设计是匿名的，但对于健康数据，我们需要这种有趣的组合，即信任的矿工，完全私密的交易，但又在区块链上达成网络共识。您对隐私保护的演变有何看法？John:
    我们首先承认，医疗保健只是刚刚开始，现阶段情况并不完美。一个明显的不成熟例子是我们围绕公共与私有区块链进行的对话。关键区别在于，虽然权限区块链仅仅是分布式解决方案，但开放式区块链提供了真正的去中心化。从技术的角度来看，我们根据要解决的问题选择协议。我们对区块链实际上代表的基于信任的交易系统的范围感到满意，这些系统从开放式和去中心化到私有和分布式不等。我们相信行业将朝着开放和公开的区块链发展，但这可能需要时间。与金融服务和其他企业一样，医疗保健企业重视更高程度的控制，也许最重要的是，目前在开放式，真正去中心化的区块链上无法实现的保密水平。无可否认的是，对于一系列业务用例来说，权限区块链是一个理想的选择。我们相信公司需要时间才能适应更传统的区块链模型，尽管显然这些模型提供了最大的安全性。重要的是要审慎考虑这种对控制的偏好如何变得有害且自我毁灭。开放式和'
