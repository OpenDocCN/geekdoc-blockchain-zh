- en: In 2008, while the rest of the world faced the biggest financial crisis in decades
    [29], a paper was circulated among a small group of cryptography enthusiasts [30].
    In this paper, Satoshi Nakamoto [31] explained the concept of a cryptocurrency
    called Bitcoin^([1](#note1)) and a solution to the long-standing problem of double
    spending (where digital tokens representing unique value can be spent more than
    once) [32]. For years, double spending has been one of the main barriers to the
    widespread adoption of digital money. In 2008, the domain name [Bitcoin.org](http://Bitcoin.org)
    was registered, and at the start of 2009, the genesis block for bitcoin—that is,
    the first block in a blockchain—was created [30]. At that point in time, nobody
    foresaw the impact that Nakamoto’s [31] underlying technology would have on the
    world’s largest organisations, trusted intermediaries, and society at large [33].

  zh: 2008年，当全世界面临几十年来最大的金融危机时[29]，一份论文在一小群密码学爱好者中流传[30]。在这篇论文中，中本聪（Satoshi Nakamoto）[31]解释了名为比特币（Bitcoin）的一种加密货币的概念，以及解决长期存在的双重支付问题（即代表唯一价值的数字代币可以被多次使用）[32]的方案。多年来，双重支付一直是数字货币广泛采用的主要障碍之一。2008年，域名[Bitcoin.org](http://Bitcoin.org)被注册，2009年初，比特币的创世区块——即区块链的第一个区块——被创建[30]。在那个时候，没有人预见到
    Nakamoto’s [31]的基础技术对世界上最大组织、受信任的中介机构以及整个社会[33]的影响。
- en: Since Nakamoto’s paper, distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchain
    technology,^([2](#note2)) has rapidly gained popularity. Although ledgers have
    been around for millennia, for the first time in history they can be updated across
    multiple organisations and computer networks simultaneously through the use of
    blockchain technology. This functionality significantly reduces the possibility
    of ‘gaming’ the system, that is, the distributed and decentralised nature of the
    blockchain ledgers prevents any single party from controlling, and therefore manipulating,
    the ledgers. The cryptography underlying blockchain ensures a ‘trustless’ system,
    thereby removing the need for intermediaries to manage risk. This is a true paradigm
    shift and it is why so many organisations are exploring Blockchain’s potential
    use to improve their tracking and audit systems.^([3](#note3)) Although blockchain
    technology has only been around for less than a decade, businesses, government
    organisations, and consortia alike have significantly invested in this modern
    phenomenon, with a view to exploiting it for their financial or political gain
    [31]. Marc Andreessen, from the well-known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz,
    calls it as big an invention as the internet. Palychata [34], a research analyst
    from BNP Paribas, compares the creation of Blockchain to the invention of the
    steam or combustion engine, whereas The Economist predicts that it will be as
    important an innovation as the invention of Limited Liability Corporations [35].

    [31]。知名风险投资公司安德森·霍洛维茨（Andreessen Horowitz）的马克·安德烈森（Marc Andreessen）称其为与互联网一样重要的发明。法国巴黎银行（BNP

    Partnership’s investigation into how the distributed ledger technology affects
    players in the financial industry. The R3 Partnership is a consortium of 80 of
    the biggest financial institutions. The R3 Partnership described its December
    2015 launch as the product of frustration among banks and other financial institutions
    with the multiple generations of disparate legacy systems that struggle to interoperate.
    In addition, six of the biggest global banks, led by Swiss bank UBS, have developed
    a ‘Utility Settlement Coin’ (USC) [36], which is the digital counterpart of each
    of the major currencies backed by central banks. Their objective is to develop
    a settlement system that processes transactions in (near) real-time, rather than
    days. The aim of the project is to enable global banks to conduct various transactions
    with each other using collateralised assets on a custom-built blockchain and to
    make financial markets more efficient [37]. A third example is Australia Post,
    which has released plans for developing a blockchain-based e-voting system for
    the state of Victoria, Australia [38]. The possibilities for the Blockchain are
    enormous and it seems that almost any industry that deals with some sort of transaction
    or tracking mechanisms can and will be disrupted by Blockchain. However, to understand
    how we should use Blockchain for social good, let’s first take a deep dive into
    the technology.

- en: A blockchain is a shared and decentralised public or private ledger that describes
    a single version of the truth of ownership [39–41]. It is a distributed ledger
    that uses database technology to record and indefinitely maintain an ever-growing
    list of data records [42], which cannot be tampered with and are irreversible,
    verifiable, and traceable [33, 42, 43]. At first, these data records were bitcoin
    transactions, but applications have now moved to any type of online transaction
    across any industry. Blockchains can serve as a record keeper for societies, including
    registration of any type of document or property [44]. Data records are stored
    chronologically in blocks that are chained together cryptographically. Every node
    in the network has a copy of the block and, in order for a transaction to be added
    to a chain, there has to be a consensus among the nodes in the network.

    game-theory incentives and cryptography [33]. This means that anyone interested
    in joining a particular permissionless blockchain can do so by simply connecting
    his or her computer to the decentralised network, downloading the application,
    and starting to process transactions. It is not necessary to have a previous relationship

- en: On the other hand, permissioned, or private, blockchains do not require these
    artificial incentives because all actors in the network are known to each other
    [33]. New actors have to be approved by existing participants in the network,
    which enables more flexibility and efficiency in validating transactions [33].
    Private blockchains are generally used by organisations that like to keep a shared
    ledger for settlement of transactions [45], such as within the financial services
    industry. They are owned and operated by a group of organisations and transactions
    are visible only to members of the network [45]. A good example of a private Blockchain
    is the Blockchain Settlement System developed by UBS and five other major banks
    in 2016 [36]. This Blockchain enables the four participating banks to discernibly
    improve settlement times among them and no other party has access to the Blockchain
    or can contribute to it.

  zh: 另一方面，授权或私有的区块链不需要这些人工激励，因为网络中的所有参与者彼此都知道[33]。新参与者必须得到网络中现有参与者的批准，这使得在验证交易时更加灵活和高效[33]。私有的区块链通常被那些喜欢保持共享账本以结算交易的组织使用[45]，如金融服务行业内部。它们由一组组织拥有和运营，并且交易只对网络成员可见[45]。一个私有区块链的好例子是瑞士银行ubs和其他五家主要银行在2016年开发的区块链结算系统[36]。这个区块链使得四家参与银行明显缩短了彼此之间的结算时间，其他任何一方都无法访问区块链或对其做出贡献。
- en: Private and public Blockchains are the two flavours that have been around and,
    for both options, the main feature is that, once a transaction is approved and
    on the Blockchain, it cannot be changed or edited. Some of the larger fintech
    institutions (including China’s first private and fully digital bank, WeBank)
    are considering layering their online banking on to combinations of public and
    private blockchain networks [46]. However, since 2016, a third option has been
    developed. Accenture has patented an ‘editable Blockchain’, the history of which
    can be adjusted by a central authority. This is a bit of a contradiction, because
    the power of the Blockchain is that data, once validated, cannot be altered. However,
    Accenture claims that this type of Blockchain would be for private permissioned
    Blockchains only—used, for example, by the banks, where a central authority can
    manage the network under agreed governance rules [47]. This type of Blockchain
    would offer a ‘safety button’ that could, in fact, make the Blockchain safer to

    [46]。然而，自2016年以来，已经开发出了第三种选择。安永会计师事务所已经申请了一项“可编辑区块链”的专利，其历史可以通过中央权威机构进行调整。这有点自相矛盾，因为区块链的力量在于，一旦验证，数据就无法更改。然而，安永声称这种区块链将仅适用于私有权限的区块链——例如，被银行使用，其中中央权威机构可以在商定的治理规则下管理网络

    key), and vice versa. It is impossible to encrypt data with a public key and use
    another public key to decrypt that data [49]. As a result, you can use a key pair
    to identify the owner of a certain digital asset. As the public key is publically
    available, any data encrypted with a related private key can be decrypted only
    by the corresponding public key. It works like a mailbox, where everyone has a

    by a Secure Hash Algorithm. A block’s hash is fixed. In other words, the hash
    ID allocated to the block never changes. Hash algorithms are used in a variety
    of components of blockchain technology, one of them being the hash ID, which is
    a unique string of 64 numbers and letters linked to data in each block. The US
    National Security Agency (NSA) has designed a second generation of cryptographic
    Hash Functions called Secure Hash Algorithms 2\. It includes SHA-256, a highly
    efficient Secure Hash Algorithm that creates a unique hash ID for every piece
    of data. Hash Algorithms create the exact same hash if the data is exactly the
    same [50]. Altering only one bit in the data will result in a completely new hash
    ID. The hash ID of a block that is added to a blockchain is the starting data
    for the next block, and as such the blocks are chained together. This means that
    if data in a block is changed, it will change the hash of that block, which in
    turn will change the hash in the subsequent block, etc. To tamper with the data,
    the blocks would have to be revalidated by consensus. This will not happen because
    the other nodes in the network do not have an incentive to work on ‘old’ blocks
    in the chain. Besides that, a blockchain keeps on growing, so it requires considerable
    computing power to revalidate old blocks, which simply makes it not worthwhile
    [51]. The hash makes data on a blockchain immutable and that it has not been changed
    over time verifiable.

    to digital currencies. Double spending refers to actors who want to cheat the

    problem is solved through the usage of a central authority (that is, a bank).
    In a decentralised system, without a central authority, it can be solved by consensus.
    To understand the issue, Lamport and Shostak [57] proposed The Byzantine Generals’
    Problem, a thought experiment about a group of generals who are each commanding
    a different part of the Byzantine army and need to agree upon a plan to attack
    and conquer an enemy city. The generals can communicate only via messenger, but
    the problem is that at least one general is a traitor. The question is how many
    traitors can the army have and still function as one force? Every consensus algorithm
    is a Byzantine Generals’ Problem solution and the first algorithm that came up
    with a solution was the PBFT algorithm [58]. Since then, many PBFT algorithms
    have been developed, before Bitcoin was introduced. PBFT algorithms can be applied
    in a decentralised, permissioned network, meaning that a central aspect to PBFT
    algorithms is that a membership is required, which has to be approved by a centralised
    authority. The PoW algorithm solved this problem [31, 54]. This consensus algorithm
    operates in a decentralised network, without a central authority, but it assumes
    that most of the actors are ‘honest’ actors and reduces the risk of dishonest
    actors.

    innovation of a PoW is that it does not require membership. For this reason, a
    central authority is no longer required. The PoW algorithm is, therefore, used
    in public or permissionless blockchains, where actors do not have to know or trust
    each other. As such, it is used in the bitcoin blockchain, which is a public blockchain.
    This consensus algorithm requires participating actors to solve a difficult computational
    problem to validate the blocks. The validation is done using cryptography, which
    means that the actor has to find the solution of an inequality, which requires
    considerable computing power (and energy). When a solution is presented, it is
    immediately clear that it is correct. This can be compared with a crossword puzzle,
    which can be difficult to solve, but once completed you immediately know that
    it is done correctly. The moment an actor has solved the equation, the solution
    is presented to the whole network and the actor receives bitcoins as a reward
    (in the case of the bitcoin blockchain).

    approach. Within PoS, as within PoW, validators are selected randomly, but, where
    validators within PoW have a larger chance of being selected if they have more
    computing power, within PoS the amount of money (that is, the number of tokens
    or the amount of cryptocurrency) that a member holds determines the likelihood
    of being selected [59]. Once a block has been produced, a transaction fee is paid
    to that validator and signers commit the block to the blockchain. These signers
    can all be nodes in the network or a randomly selected group of nodes that do
    the signing for the complete network. To ‘incentivise’ nodes to hold a larger
    stake, the more stake a node has in the network, the less complex the puzzles
    the node has to solve. As a result, nodes that already have a large stake can
    easily become larger. PoS still requires a consensus agreement on the current
    state of the network, but the more crypto-coins an actor owns, the higher the
    stake in the success of a blockchain. As a result, PoS requires far fewer computer
    processing unit computations and therefore is more energy efficient [60]. The
    assumption underlying PoS is simple: if an actor has a higher stake in the system,
    they have a higher incentive to ensure that the network is secure and correct
    because of the pain felt when the price and reputation of the cryptocurrency are
    damaged, due to attacks. It is expected that the Ethereum network will implement
    a PoS consensus mechanism in 2018.'

  zh: 权益证明（PoS）是另一种常见的共识算法，它采取了不同的方法。在PoS中，正如在PoW中一样，验证者是随机选择的，但是，与PoW中的验证者相比，如果他们拥有更多的计算能力，他们被选中的机会更大，而在PoS中，一个成员持有的货币量（即代币数量或加密货币的量）决定了被选中的可能性[59]。一旦产生了区块，就会支付交易费给那个验证者，签署者将区块提交到区块链上。这些签署者可以是网络中的所有节点，或者是一组随机选择的节点，为整个网络进行签署。为了“激励”节点持有更大的权益，一个节点在网络中的权益越大，节点需要解决的谜题就越简单。因此，已经在网络中拥有大量权益的节点可以很容易地变得更大。PoS仍然需要对网络的当前状态达成共识，但是一个参与者拥有的加密货币越多，他们对区块链成功的权益就越大。因此，PoS需要的计算单元计算量要少得多，因此更加节能[60]。PoS背后的假设很简单：如果一个参与者对系统的权益更高，他们就有更大的动力确保网络是安全和正确的，因为他们会因为加密货币的价格和声誉受损而感到痛苦。预计以太坊网络将在2018年实现PoS共识机制。

    every block that is added to a blockchain is timestamped to prove temporal relationships
    between different events [31, 61]. The timestamp basically confirms that a certain
    transaction occurred on the blockchain at a certain time. If an actor tries to
    cheat the system and offer the same transaction again, nodes will check the transaction
    against the timestamp and, if the transaction is found in a previous block, the
    nodes in the network will come to a consensus that the transaction is invalid.
    In addition, the timestamp feature, in combination with the hash, enables users
    to prove at any given moment that a certain document was owned by a particular
    user at a certain moment in time and that since then the document has not been

    contract is on a blockchain, it is final and cannot be changed (that is, they
    become immutable, verifiable, and traceable). However, certain parameters can
    be altered only if the original code allows for this. Therefore, it is vital for
    organisations to ensure that the code is 100% correct and that no bugs or errors
    remain in the smart contract when it is recorded on the blockchain. Mistakes can
    be extremely costly, as we have seen with The DAO Hack which lost US$50 million
    due to a mistake in the smart contract [74]. The only way to fix a bug in a deployed
    smart contract is through a ‘hard fork’ on the blockchain, which is exactly what

    smart contracts remove the need for developing, implementing, or evaluating decisions

    The only difference now is that, when they are deployed on the blockchain, they
    remain accessible indefinitely and will carry out their predefined tasks whenever
    certain conditions are met. Smart contracts offer tremendous opportunities for
    organisations, but it is vital that they are deployed on the blockchain only when
    they are correct. In the coming years, we will probably see a wide variety of

    distributed either by hierarchy or by knowledge, and often these are related;
    the higher up the hierarchy, the more information you have and the more power
    you have within the organisation [82]. Within a DAO, this works differently. Power
    is determined by the number of tokens an actor owns, an actor’s trust level, and
    their achieved merits. This will shift the power balance within an organisation
    from a hierarchical structure to a distributed structure, thereby affecting the
    governance structure [83].

  zh: DAO 是一种由智能合约组成的组合，可能与物联网设备、大数据分析和人工智能相连。它由不可篡改的代码在一套不可逆转的业务规则**独占控制**下运行[39]。DAO
    将拥有来自今天组织中的不同参与者；它将需要广泛的数据治理流程，以确保数据的可靠性和准确性，并将导致一种根本新的组织结构[44, 79-81]。DAO 是一个自我组织的框架，它使用基于共识的自动化决策，其中参与者无需相互信任即可相互交互。在
    DAO 内部没有传统的组织层次结构，因为层次结构是由所有权（即参与者被信任的程度以及由于行为而获得的该参与者的功绩）决定的。这种组织结构的变化影响了权力平衡。在传统组织中，权力要么通过层次结构，要么通过知识来分配，而且这些往往是有关系的；层次结构越高，你拥有的信息越多，你在组织内的权力也越大[82]。在
    DAO 中，这种方式有所不同。权力由参与者拥有的代币数量、参与者的信任级别和他们实现的功绩来决定。这将使组织内的权力平衡从层次结构转变为分布式结构，从而影响治理结构[83]。
- en: 'In its simplest form, a DAO is just immutable computer code: one or more smart
    contracts linked together and deployed on a blockchain, encouraging actors to
    self-organise. The code defines governance within the DAO, because governance
    is the rules that are implemented within the smart contracts. With the functionality
    of blockchain technology, a DAO can be seen as a self-organising structure that
    uses consensus mechanisms to make automated decisions, without the need for trust.
    As a result, within a DAO, there is no traditional hierarchy (because there are
    no employees or managers), no traditional governance (because the code is the
    governance as the rules are embedded within the smart contracts), and it is not
    possible to email or call a DAO, except for interacting with chat bots (because
    the entire organisation operates automatically, without the need for people being
    involved). DAOs can, however, operate as traditional organisations, although they
    do this autonomously; they can order products and services, have customers and
    suppliers, and make profits or losses. It has the same activities as a traditional
    organisation; it needs to make money, it has costs, it has customers, shareholders,
    and even employees (although these are independent contractors), it offers a product
    or service, and it is subjected to regulatory requirements (although being a distributed
    company this becomes a lot more difficult since regulatory requirements could
    be contradictory across jurisdictions). Therefore, governance is important when
    developing a DAO and a governance structure should be incorporated within the
    DAO (within the code). In addition, one should ensure that the code of the DAO
    works and continues to function correctly for an indefinite amount of time because,
    once deployed on a blockchain, it becomes irreversible. Lack of governance or
    quality assurance can have major consequences, as was shown in The DAO Hack in
    2016 [84]. Therefore, in summary, actors who want to establish a DAO have to ensure
    that the right governance structure is implemented within the code and that the
    code works correctly to guarantee that the DAO can operate properly once deployed.'

  zh: 在它的最简单形式中，DAO 就是不可更改的计算机代码：一系列智能合约的集合，部署在区块链上，促使参与者自我组织。代码定义了 DAO 内的治理结构，因为治理就是实现在智能合约中的规则。借助区块链技术的功能，DAO
    可以被看作是一个使用共识机制来自动做出决策的自我组织结构，无需信任。因此，在 DAO 内部，没有传统层级（因为没有员工或管理者），没有传统治理（因为代码就是治理，规则已嵌入智能合约中），也无法通过电子邮件或电话联系
    DAO，只能与聊天机器人互动（因为整个组织是自动运作的，无需人员参与）。然而，DAO 仍然可以作为传统组织运作，尽管它们是自主运作；它们可以订购产品和服务，有客户和供应商，也可以盈利或亏损。它与传统组织有相同的活动；需要赚钱，有成本，有客户、股东，甚至员工（尽管这些是独立承包商），提供产品或服务，并受到监管要求（尽管作为分布式公司，这变得更加困难，因为监管要求在不同司法管辖区可能相互矛盾）。因此，在开发
    DAO 时，治理结构非常重要，应该将治理结构纳入 DAO（代码中）。此外，还应确保 DAO 的代码长期有效并正确运行，因为一旦部署在区块链上，它就不可逆转。缺乏治理或质量保证可能会产生重大后果，正如
    2016 年的 The DAO 攻击所显示的那样[84]。因此，总结来说，希望建立 DAO 的参与者必须确保在代码中实施正确的治理结构，并确保代码正确运行，以保证
    DAO 一旦部署就能正常运作。

    it automatically books an appointment with a car service station. The repairman
    automatically and immediately receives a report on what needs to be done and if
    any parts need to be ordered. After years of great service, the car notices that
    it has reached the end of its life and automatically drives itself to the car-recycling
    company. Some time before that, smart contracts ordered a new self-driving car,
    based on the demand it sees in the market. The moment the old car is recycled,
    the new car leaves the factory and picks up the first passenger. No manager, no

    value across the stakeholders. ‘Investors’ who purchase these coins during the

    will rise and as such they can get a (substantial) return on their investment.

    prevent cryptocurrency being traded by people who are not allowed to do so (although
    due to the inherent decentralised nature of it, they can never prevent users from
    making transactions outside exchanges). Regulations can also enforce exchanges

    remain an issue as the popularity of Bitcoin increases. In 2017, this scalability
    challenge resulted in a division among bitcoin miners. As a result, some miners
    decided to hard fork and create a new cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash, which enables

    974 kB, which means that every block is filled up with transactions. Bitcoin was
    created in such a way that miners who validate transactions have to use a tremendous
    amount of computing power (that is, energy). If there is an increasing demand
    for transactions to be validated, miners will prioritise transactions that pay
    a higher fee. Economics 101 dictates that, if the demand increases, but supply
    remains the same (number of transactions that can be validated per block), the
    price increases.

  zh: 交易费用高昂的原因在于，目前每个区块的大小限制为1 MB，几乎每个区块都完全装满了交易。例如，2018年5月4日，平均区块大小为974 kB，这意味着每个区块都充满了交易。比特币的设计方式是这样的：验证交易的矿工必须使用大量的计算能力（即能量）。如果对验证交易的需求不断增加，矿工会优先处理支付更高费用的交易。经济学原理101告诉我们，如果需求增加，但供应保持不变（每个区块可以验证的交易数量），价格就会上升。
- en: Another reason for the increased transaction fee is the newly created cryptocurrency
    Bitcoin Cash that split off from Bitcoin on 1 August 2017\. Bitcoin and Bitcoin
    Cash are very similar cryptocurrencies, which means that miners can easily switch
    from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash, if it becomes more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash
    (the rationale behind this has to do with how the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash protocols
    have been developed; if there are fewer miners, the mining difficulty goes down,
    and the possibility to make more money increases). Fewer miners on the Bitcoin
    network means less supply, which means an increased transaction fee.

    in size. The reality is that, without a solution to this problem, the number of
    transactions per second remains limited, and the transaction fees will continue
    to increase. Or, as Vitalik Buterin [96], founder of Ethereum, said: ‘If [the

    largest bitcoin exchange, was hacked and as a result US$460 million disappeared

    are stored in transparent and shared databases, and protects data from removal,
    corruption, or modification using a consensus mechanism and cryptography. The
    Hash Algorithm ensures that we can always control whether a document, ownership,
    or transaction has been altered. The immutability of records on a blockchain ensures
    that we can always go back to the origin of a transaction, to control or monitor
    who has been involved in that transaction across time and space. Apart from transactions,
    a blockchain can also store smart contracts, so-called If This Then That statements,
    albeit a lot more complex. These contracts are written in code, understandable
    across jurisdictions, and ensure that a certain action will automatically take
    place once certain pre-set conditions have been met. When you start combining
    one or multiple smart contracts with technologies such as big data analytics and
    artificial intelligence, it becomes possible to create DApps or even DAOs. A DAO
    is an organisation without management or employees, run completely by code, where
    (data) governance is enforced in the code. In this way, existing paradigms of
    how we should run an organisation are changed completely.

  zh: 区块链是一种分布式账本技术，确保数据和合同存储在透明和共享的数据库中，并通过共识机制和密码学保护数据免受删除、篡改或修改。哈希算法确保我们总能控制一个文档、所有权或交易是否已被修改。区块链上记录的不变性确保我们总能追溯到交易的起源，控制或监控跨越时间和空间参与交易的人员。除了交易，区块链还可以存储智能合约，所谓的“如果这个，那么那个”的声明，尽管要复杂得多。这些合同用代码编写，跨司法管辖区可理解，并确保一旦满足了某些预设条件，某个特定动作将自动发生。当你开始将一个或多个智能合约与大数据分析、人工智能等技术结合时，创建DApps或甚至DAOs成为可能。DAO是一个没有管理或员工的组织，完全由代码运行，其中（数据）治理在代码中执行。这种方式，我们应该如何运行一个组织的现有范式被彻底改变。
- en: The Blockchain, and with it the hundreds of DApps that have already been developed,
    offer a glimpse of what the future holds. Blockchain is still in its early development
    and a lot of development work has still to be done. However, decentralised applications
    that are run by smart contracts, without the need for a centralised governing
    power that generally takes a large commission, offer tremendous advantages. They
    are cheaper and more efficient to run, more difficult to control by governments
    or centralised organisations, and more secure and transparent than existing applications.
    It is these technologies and applications (Blockchain, smart contracts, DApps,
    and even DAOs) that could contribute to solving Wicked Problems.

  zh: 区块链及其已经开发的数百个DApps，为我们展示了未来可能的样子。区块链仍处于早期发展阶段，还有很多开发工作要做。然而，由智能合约运行的去中心化应用程序，无需中心化的
    governing power 通常抽取大量佣金，具有巨大的优势。它们运行成本更低、更高效，更难以被政府或中心化组织控制，比现有应用程序更安全、更透明。正是这些技术和应用程序（区块链、智能合约、DApps，甚至DAOs）可能有助于解决Wicked
    Problems。
