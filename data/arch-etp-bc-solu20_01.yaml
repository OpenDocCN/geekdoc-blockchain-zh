- en: This book is not about cryptocurrency and how you can become rich trading Bitcoin
    or Dash. It is an enterprise-focused book on blockchain technology. The main focus
    of the book is on Hyperledger, R3 Corda, Quorum, Ripple, and Ethereum. A secondary
    focus is on other technologies that provide value as well such as off-chains like
    Blockstream or smaller blockchain projects such as Lisk or NEO that enterprises
    may be considering. The reality is that blockchains that utilize smart contracts
    provide immense value to enterprises when properly developed, planned, and implemented.
    I also cover in detail how to use IBM Blockchain Platform As A Service and AWS
    Blockchain Templates to drive your customers’ proof of concepts (PoCs) and production
    blockchains.

    can jump in front of the train or you can jump on board. The question is, do you
    want to be enabled in blockchain or do you prefer to let your competition deal
