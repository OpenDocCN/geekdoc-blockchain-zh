- en: Having discussed CheBanca! as a digital bank with branches, we will now examine
    the characteristics of a digital bank. Digital banks are being created in response
    to the development of the ValueWeb through FinTech. As a result of these pressures,
    incumbent banks are being forced to become digital banks. Banks cannot compete
    with new FinTech start-ups if they do not become digitalised. Equally, banks cannot
    deal with global peer-to-peer connectivity through the mobile network if they
    are not digital. They cannot support the exchange of value for free, if they are
    not digital. But what exactly is a digital bank?

  zh: 在我们已经讨论了作为一家带有分支机构的数字银行的 CheBanca! 之后，我们现在将审视数字银行的特点。数字银行是针对通过金融科技发展的价值网络而创建的。由于这些压力，传统银行被迫转变为数字银行。如果银行不数字化，它们就无法与新的金融科技初创公司竞争。同样地，如果银行不是数字化的话，它们无法通过移动网络处理全球点对点连接。如果它们不是数字化的话，它们就无法支持价值的自由交换。但是，到底什么是数字银行呢？
- en: I am asked this question often. A digital bank is designed for the digital distribution
    of data through the globalised network of the internet; a traditional bank is
    designed for the physical distribution of paper in a localised network of branches.
    In other words, digital turns traditional banks on their head.

  zh: 数字银行并不仅仅是实施互联网技术。
- en: • First and foremost, it is a bank built with a vision to reach out to customers
    through digital augmentation. It is built specifically to offer the customer the
    service of their choice through their access point of choice. The bank, therefore,
    has to be designed and created upon a digital core infrastructure. The digital
    core is a consistent enterprise-wide, cleansed data store that is accessible internally
    and externally through a strata of access layers. In other words, the start point
    of a digital bank is to be IP-enabled at its core. No legacy. No barriers, except
    those that avoid fraud and cyber attacks.

  zh: '-   首先，它是一家具有通过数字增强到达客户的愿景的银行。它专门为了通过客户选择的接入点提供客户所选择的服务而建立。因此，银行必须在数字核心基础设施上设计和创建。数字核心是一个一致的企业范围内的、经过清洗的数据存储库，可以通过一系列访问层内部和外部访问。换句话说，数字银行的起点是在其核心处启用
    IP。没有遗留问题。没有障碍，除了那些防止欺诈和网络攻击的障碍。'
- en: • Second, the digital bank then creates outreach through access. That access
    can be both physical and digital, but it’s outreach to the digital core on the
    basis of providing customer choice. In other words, the customer may visit a branch,
    call the contact centre, make a comment on Twitter or Facebook, or touch the bank’s
    mortgage offers via a Google search. Because the bank has a digital core, it will
    be aware of all these access points and touches, and will respond accordingly
    and consistently. For example, if the customer has researched mortgage deals online
    the previous night, checked the latest interest rates on the app in the morning
    and walks into the branch at lunchtime, the bank will be ready with their mortgage
    specialists at hand—possibly through a videolink to a small branch—to provide
    the advice needed for the customer to make the decision over the mortgage deal.

  zh: • 第三，数字银行通过获取创建了对外的接触机会。这种接触可以是物理的也可以是数字的，但它是基于提供客户选择的数字核心的对外接触。换句话说，客户可以访问分行、致电联系中心、在Twitter或Facebook上发表评论，或通过Google搜索了解银行的抵押贷款优惠。由于银行有一个数字核心，它将意识到所有这些接触点和接触，并将做出相应和一致的回应。例如，如果客户前一晚在线研究了抵押贷款交易，早上通过应用程序查看了最新的利率，中午走进分行，银行将准备好他们的抵押贷款专家——可能通过视频链接到一个小分行——为客户提供做出有关抵押贷款交易的决策所需的建议。
- en: • Third, the digital bank has an organisation that is geared to digital. The
    main form of customer outreach is through social media on the network, via video
    to advisors, and focused upon being at the point of relevance to the customer
    in their daily life. It focuses upon augmenting the customers’ life through digital
    outreach, but recognises the importance of the customer engaging directly face-to-face.
    The human contact through the network is the magical touchpoint. All other functions
    are geared towards removing friction through digital enhancement.

- en: • Fourth, the digital bank will have an innate knowledge of the customer. They
    will leverage data as a competitive differentiation, and see a single view of
    the customer as the ultimate view. They will know that data association and predictive,
    proactive, proximity-based service is the place they will win.

    culture, rather than a project. The bank does not have a digital team or a budget
    for digital. They have integrated digital into their core, and see it as the duty
    of everyone in the bank to identify how to use digital series to touch the customer
    better, at lower cost and with an intimacy and data differentiation far more fit
    for the digital age. In other words, an Amazon-style processor of finance, rather
    than a Barnes & Noble.

    in the back office on a mainframe. The transactions were the debit and credit
    accounting ledgers, and the information derived from branch-based operations.
    In the 1970s, we implemented 3270 green screens in branches to feed those mainframes
    with data for the transaction ledgers. This was a cost-cutting, administrative
    and efficiency play. It worked. In the 1980s, we introduced ATMs to the network.

    electronic outreach point for most banks.

- en: In the 1990s, the next major electronic movement was to remote customer support
    through the telephone call centre. Already, by this time, banks had multiple legacy
    systems created through M&A, expansion of offers and disparate IT strategies.
    Most banks had multiple head office systems on multiple provider platforms, because
    they built their deposit account administration on IBM, for example, but then
    introduced insurance, mortgages, cards and other product lines from other specialists,
    from Unisys to Fujitsu to Amdahl. This is why most call centre customer service
    representatives were already struggling by 1999, because they had to access multiple
    systems across multiple platforms to get a comprehensive customer view.

    we had to make what was previously only visible internally, external. We had to
    give customers online banking, and so we had to rethink the internal machine.
    Most banks didn’t. They just took the internal machine, and stuck a front-end,
    internet bank access on it through a username and password. That is why most banks’
    internet banking looks just like a bank statement, because that’s just what it
    is—an online access to the bank statement.

- en: We got away with offering an online access to a bank statement for a decade,
    but then the smartphone appeared with apps and real-time, and the emperor’s lack

    internal systems from big screens onto small screens, but it just didn’t work.

    that needs sorting out. In fact, banks are cemented in legacy mess, which is why

    the legacy. So when I hear banks talking about omnichannel or digital channel,
    I know that they are just adding layers to legacy. And it will not work. It will
    not work because the legacy is based upon a physical infrastructure view, i.e.,
    a structure built in the last century for the physical distribution of paper in
    a localised network. We now need to rebuild this for the digital distribution

    on year, by using these different factors to improve or decrease the attractiveness

- en: Fourth, most banks are driven by cost-income ratio and shareholder return. Therefore,
    investing in retail bank infrastructure to improve customer service doesn’t cut
    the ice. In fact, most of this would be overhead investment rather than balance

    requirements that go with that license. I liken it to an army camp. You have free
    movement of people outside the Ministry of Defence camp but, inside, it’s a lockdown
    situation. That’s pretty much how money and banking is. Outside the industry your
    can have free movement, so people can create pretty apps around money. But the
    money movement itself is ring-fenced by regulation to be secure, resilient and
    reliable. It’s a financial encampment that has to be police forced. As a result,

- en: “Network effects is the term given to systems in which the value of each user
    is increased as the number of users goes up. Such network effects are common on
    the internet; for example, eBay and Facebook. The value of some such systems is
    roughly in proportion to the number of connections between users, meaning that
    if the user base doubles, the value of the system quadruples. This also acts as
    a barrier to new competitors, since new users are much more likely to join your
    system than a smaller one that doesn’t offer the same value. If your company believes
    it will able to leverage such network effects, it often makes sense to treat the
    first users as a loss leader and get big as fast as you can.”
