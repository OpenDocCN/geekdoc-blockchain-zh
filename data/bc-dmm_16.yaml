- en: Banking was the first industry to recognize the threat of Bitcoin and then the
    potential of blockchain to transform the industry. The banking sector is highly
    regulated, and the fees to organize and operate as a bank are expensive. These
    heavy regulations have been an insulating and protective shield for the whole
    industry, as well as a burden. The application of fast, efficient, digital money
    that doesn’t carry the cost of handling cash and that is traceable as it moves
    through the financial system was an intoxicating and threatening proposal. The
    idea that value can be held outside the control of central authorities also piqued
    the interest of financial institutions and governments that back currencies.

- en: In 2013 and 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a
    warning to investors about the potential risks of investments involving virtual
    currency. The warning was that investors might be enticed with the promise of
    high returns and would not be skeptical enough of the new investment space that
    was so novel and cutting-edge. According to the SEC, digital currency was one
    of the top ten threats to investors. Today, the SEC stands ready to engage with
    companies and investors as cryptocurrency gains traction within all industries.

- en: Not even two years later, countries around the world — including the UK, Canada,
    Australia, and China — began investigating how they could create their own digital
    currencies, seizing cryptocurrency for themselves and put money on the blockchain.
    The turning point was when they began to perceive that the benefits started outweighing
    the risks. Bitcoin had been able to stand up to hackers for several years, even
    when many government systems were compromised, making it an appealing system to
    try. Innovations in blockchain technology promised to be able to handle the billions
    of transaction need to support economies, making a cryptocurrency feasible at

    even if they weren’t viewable to the public. Blockchain technology and digital
    currencies would reduce risk and fraud and give them ultimate control in executing
    monetary policy and taxation. It would not be anonymous like Bitcoin was at first.
    In fact, quite the opposite: It would allow them a full and auditable trail of

    central banks to replace commercial banks’ role in circulating money.'

    they need to know the identity of all the individuals utilizing their currency.

    transactions, like distributed ledgers in blockchains, except for centralized.

    unethical actions caused the world economy to collapse. It shifts from a “trust
    or doesn’t trust” view of the world to a trustless system. This subtle difference
