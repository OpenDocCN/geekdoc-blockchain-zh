    related conversation and potential area of revenue and advisory services that
    financial services professionals may have traditionally overlooked is the importance
    of cybersecurity advisory services in a business environment that is increasingly
    digitized. Cybersecurity policies and training may have, in the past, focused
    on ensuring that the organization had in place sufficient password controls and
    safeguard to protect data against unauthorized access to client information and
    ensuring that anti-virus software was kept up to date. While these are still,
    rather obviously, still important for every organization, they now simply represent
    a good starting point in the conversation rather than the end point in the debate.
    Stated differently, cybersecurity has moved beyond merely an IT or technical concern,
    and is increasingly a concern for the entire organization at large (McLane [2018](#CR8)).
    None of this is news, however; every professional is going to be aware of just
    how important data integrity and cybersecurity it. Let’s connect this trend and
    topic area to the same topics we have been discussing throughout this book; blockchain,
    artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity tools (Fig. [15.1](#Fig1)).![../images/467992_1_En_15_Chapter/467992_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/467992_1_En_15_Chapter/467992_1_En_15_Fig1_HTML.png)

    that can revolutionize almost every aspect of the financial services industry,
    but at the end of the day it is simply a technology tool like any other. With
    that context in the mind, and taking into account that some of the strengths of
    this technology may also become weaknesses given the situation, several areas
    of consideration being to crystallize. First and foremost, which individuals and
    institutions actually have access to the underlying code, which is after all how
    blockchain functions. Despite the other applications and iterations of blockchain
    that have entered the marketplace, at the core of the idea the functionality of
    blockchain is driven by the programming and coding language. Given the reality
    that many organizations will simply not possess the internal expertise to build
    and develop these tools internally, how are the external consultants and advisors
    vetted? For example, if consultants or advisors were brought into consult and
    help develop different engineering processes those plans and processes would be
    safeguarded with both electronic and physical controls; the security processes

    accrue the benefits of using such a technology tool and system, individuals and
    teams must know both how these tools function and how these tools can be applied
    across the proverbial board (He et al. [2018](#CR6)). Without establishing training

    into the advisory conversation. Technology can only amplify and accelerate the
    current processes and policies that are in place, and will have no impact on the
    underlying processes themselves. Particularly and especially important in a business
    environment and landscape where information and data is increasingly treated and

    part of the financial services conversation is a paradox that is increasingly
    relevant and present in the marketplace. Storing information, even that of a digital
    nature, was traditionally quite expensive and required some level of technical
    expertise to operate, maintain, and expand over time. With the development and
    continued refinement of cloud based data platforms, however, storing and maintain
    records and copies of information has become cheaper, faster, and a core component
    of how many individuals and firms operate. This is all well and good, but if this
    information is being stored in a permanent nature, such as on a blockchain, or
    is being mined – no pun intended – by different types of AI or automation protocols,
    does this change with the new data regulations coming down the pipeline. Discussed
    in more detail in the coming pages, merging and juggling the advances and core
    facets of emerging technologies with the importance and necessity of complying
    with regulations is something that is going to have to be addressed.

    in nature are services lines and products affiliated with helping clients deal
    and contend with the issues affiliated with data storage and management. This
    may seem contrary because, with virtually no stop or pause since the implementation
    of Moore’s Law during the 1960s and 1970s, information and data has been decreasing
    in cost, increasing in efficiency, and also increasing with the ease with which
    these tools and services and be used. From a board level, maintain appropriate
    levels of control, custody, and instituting appropriate controls over customer
    and consumer data is an imperative requirement of financial institutions across
    the board, and especially at the executive and board levels of those organiations
    (Morrison and Kumar [2018](#CR9)). Taking a step back from the specific machinations
    affiliated with accounting and finance and instead viewing the this shift from
    a broader perspective, the following conclusions can be analyzed and reported.
    The rise in storage as a core part of business innovation and development has,
    actually, indirectly led to the rise and development of the entire fields of big
    data, business intelligence, data analytics, and ultimately the very automation
    and data oriented tools that this book and much of the current market debate and
    commentary focuses on. The very ease with which data is stored, however, and even
    though it has led indirectly to the rise of entirely new industries, also poses
    a paradox for financial professionals seeking to develop and offer new services.
    Put simply, the intersection of data storage, the analytics that are based off
    of these data sets, and the new services offerings that can be built on top of
    means that an old trend, highlighted by headline hacks and breaches, may actually
    be new again in terms of client demand and expectations (Allodi and Massacci [2017](#CR1)).
    In other words, the very compliance and reporting functions that have been moving
    out of the conversation as technology has moved in may be coming back to the forefront.

    spirit of both this book and the trends that are driving the profession forward,

    anything new or particularly exciting, but the interesting part is not connected
    to the regulation itself, but rather how emerging regulations connect to emerging
    technologies (Griggs and Gul [2017](#CR5)). Be it regulation originating overseas
    or in the United States, contending with the regulation themselves as well as
    how regulation will change and alter underlying business models is not something
    that can ignored (Goldin et al. [2018](#CR4)). For example, the very FAANG stocks
    that drive much of the market volatility in the United States are, virtually without
    exception, based on the collection, storage, and analysis of consumer information.
    While clients or every firm may not contend with the scope or scale of issues

    and Gul [2017](#CR5)）。无论这些规定是源于海外还是美国，应对法规本身以及法规如何改变和改变基础业务模型都是不能被忽视的（Goldin et
    al. [2018](#CR4)）。例如，在美国推动市场波动的几乎所有FAANG股票都基于对消费者信息的收集、存储和分析。虽然客户或每个公司可能没有处理与最大的信息技术组织相关的问题的范围或规模，但几乎每个组织都会收集和保留与客户相关的信息。

    problem and issue facing an organization. Better yet, and no matter how applicable
    the technology tool may be to address a specific problem or issue, the training,
    education, and communication associated with these technology tools must become
    a part of the professional conversation (Lai [2018](#CR7)).

  zh: 技术无疑是一个热词，已经有几十年了，不同技术工具的潜力和现实持续增长和发展，但现实情况是，并非每个组织都同样为潜在的不同工具所准备。此外，重要的是要记住，并非随着时间的推移出现的每个问题都适合用不同类型的人工智能、自动化或基于区块链的技术工具来解决。除此之外，认识到许多这些工具确实已准备好在不同类型的组织中实施，并不是每种技术工具都对组织面临的每一个问题和挑战都有用。更好的是，无论技术工具对解决特定问题或挑战的适用性如何，与这些技术工具相关的培训、教育和交流必须成为专业交流的一部分（Lai
    [2018](#CR7)）。
- en: Technology, no matter how buzzworthy and evolved the specific tool may be, needs
    to be tested, developed, and retested prior to full on implementation, and whenever
    that happens there will inevitably be various setbacks along the way. Being able
    to logically and rationally analyze these topics and concerns, and deal with them
    in a proactive and forward looking manner are skills that every financial professional
    must be able to asses and leverage moving forward. Especially as technology tools
    become mainstream in both consumer and professional situations, the necessity
    of financial professionals to set expectations, and to rationalize these expectations
    along the way, will only become more important moving forward.

  zh: 技术，无论具体工具有多么吸引人和先进，都需要在完全实施之前经过测试、开发和重新测试，而每当这种情况发生时，一定会出现各种挫折。能够逻辑和理性地分析这些话题和担忧，并以积极和前瞻的方式处理它们，是每个金融专业人士必须评估和利用的技能。特别是随着技术工具成为消费者和专业场景的主流，金融专业人士设定预期，并在行进的过程中对这些预期进行合理化将变得更加重要。

  zh: 第15章 总结
- en: Cybersecurity and cyber insurance  may not be topics or concepts that are considered
    to especially sexy or interesting among large swaths of professionals, but these
    businesses are only going to grow increasingly important as blockchain and other
    emerging technology become integrated into business operations. Hacks, breaches,
    and other types or data security concerns have become increasingly commonplace
    as data sharing and communication has moved from the realm of expensive to plentiful
    in nature. Automation, RPA, and iterations of artificial intelligence continue
    to create situations in which data is both plentiful and share on a nearly continuous
    basis. With this increased sharing of information, however, comes an increasing
    focus on how cybersecurity fits into the business decision making conversation.
    Cybersecurity is a core issue that has been fundamentally altered by the implementation
    of blockchain; since data becomes more widespread and shared between network members
    ensuring that data management and integrity as built into business models and
    practices. Cyber-insurance, alongside the increased importance of cybersecurity,
    is also positioned to play a larger role and occupy a larger percentage of professional’s
    time moving forward. This also means that practitioners and professionals will
    need to understand how cybersecurity and cyber-insurance operate from a technical
    perspective as well as how these becoming mainstream so it does appear reasonable
    to expect this to increase in both value and importance.

  zh: 网络安全和网络保险可能不是吸引大批专业人士的话题或概念，但随着区块链和其他新兴技术融入业务运营，这些业务将变得越来越重要。随着数据共享和通信从昂贵到丰富变得更加普遍，黑客攻击、数据泄漏和其他类型的数据安全问题变得越来越普遍。自动化、RPA和人工智能的不断演变形成了让数据几乎持续性地丰富和共享的情况。然而，随着信息共享的增加，网络安全如何融入业务决策对话也变得更加关键。网络安全是区块链实施所根本改变的核心问题；因为数据变得更加普遍并在网络成员之间共享，确保数据管理和完整性被构建到业务模型和实践中。网络保险，随着网络安全的日益重要，也将在未来扮演更大的角色并占据更大比例的专业时间。这也意味着从技术角度了解网络安全和网络保险的从业人员和专业人士将需要理解这些如何成为主流，因此合理预期这两者在价值和重要性上都会增加。
