- en: Moving away from the Bitworker to now consider the macro-level effects of these
    disruptive triumvirate technologies, our main concern must be the lack of uniformity
    in how these benefits are received, perhaps allocated, across societies. The commoditisation
    of previously skilled and semi-skilled labour may further marginalise many within
    the ever increasing left-behind who fail to receive the benefits of globalisation
    and technological enhancements relative to often the incumbent power and educated
    classes. The consequences for how this may play out in our politics and international
    affairs would be of concern to us all and arguably not a world within which we
    would wish to live and work. Indeed, protections must be in place to ensure that
    workers are not exploited and perhaps more importantly, do not perceive themselves
    to be exploited.

  zh: 现在，我们不再考虑比特工人，而是考虑这些颠覆性三位一体技术的宏观层面影响时，我们的主要关注点必须是这些好处在社会中的接受程度的不一致性，也许是分配方式的不一致性。以前受过技能培训和半受过技能培训的劳动力的商品化可能会进一步边缘化许多人，这些人无法享受全球化和技术增强带来的好处，相对于通常的现任权力和受过教育的阶级。这可能会在我们的政治和国际事务中产生何种后果是我们所有人都关心的问题，可以说这不是我们希望生活和工作的世界。确实，必须制定保护措施，以确保工人不受剥削，也许更重要的是，不要认为自己受到剥削。
- en: The tokenisation and market pricing of labour across new technological platforms
    such as decentralised labour exchanges (DEXs), although efficient, must not proceed
    unchecked at a macroeconomic level. Such protections at a governmental or regulatory
    level might include minimum per unit (Bit task) pricing equivalent to a national
    minimum wage or national living wage. Additional mechanisms may also include restrictions
    on the amount, or proportion, of time that an individual is permitted to forward
    sell on these new markets. The objective of such a proposal would be twofold.
    Firstly, Bitworkers who are in demand would obviously be able to forward sell
    a larger amount of their future work time, for example, an architect may be able
    to say seven years of their future work given that she is in high demand whereas
    an underwriter only two years because comparatively there is less demand or perhaps
    concern about ultimate job replacement owing to automation.

  zh: 劳动力的代币化和市场定价在新技术平台上的运作，比如分散式劳动力交易所（DEXs），虽然高效，但在宏观经济层面上不能毫无限制地进行。政府或监管层面的这种保护措施可能包括将单位（比特任务）的最低定价设定为国家最低工资或国家最低生活工资的等值。其他机制还可能包括限制个人被允许在这些新市场上预售的时间量或比例。这样提议的目标将是双重的。首先，需求旺盛的比特工人显然能够预售更多的未来工作时间，例如，一个建筑师可能能够预售她未来七年的工作时间，因为她很受欢迎，而一个核保人可能只能预售两年，因为相对来说需求较少，或者可能担心由于自动化而最终被取代的工作。
- en: You would be forgiven for wondering what the problem is with selling your future
    self. Surely it is a good thing with the future worker? Such an arrangement would
    provide a guarantee of future income and the provision of work, and with such
    certainty workers such as the architect above will be able to better plan financially
    as well as access financial products such as loans and mortgages for a lower fee
    because they represent a reduced risk given that their future work is guaranteed.
    This upside must however be contrasted against the status quo of today. The forward
    contract above is much more restrictive than a contract of employment. Indeed,
    once committed, should you suffer ill health or perhaps a change of location or
    career is desired, you would have to compensate the counterparty of the contract
    who is essentially the person or institution who has purchased your future time.
    Similar to that of a professional footballer – a five-year contract with Manchester
    United Football Club is to be celebrated in providing you with certainty of income,
    but ultimately you are tied to that club for that period of time irrespective
    of the performance of the team and any changes in your preferred location or club
    going forward.

  zh: 如果你想知道将未来的自己卖掉有什么问题，那是可以理解的。毕竟，对未来的劳动者来说这是一件好事吧？这样的安排将提供未来收入的保证和工作的安排，有了这样的确定性，像上面的建筑师这样的工作者就能更好地进行财务规划，以及更低的费用获取贷款和抵押贷款，因为他们代表了一个降低了风险的保证，因为他们的未来工作是有保证的。然而，这种好处必须与今天的现状相对比。上面的远期合同比雇佣合同更加限制性。事实上，一旦承诺了，如果你遭受健康问题，或者可能想要改变居住地或职业，你就必须补偿合同的交易对手，他本质上是购买了你未来时间的人或机构。类似于职业足球运动员——与曼联足球俱乐部签订的五年合同将为你提供收入的确定性，但无论球队表现如何以及你未来偏好的地点或俱乐部的变化如何，你最终都会与该俱乐部绑定在一起，而这段时间内不受影响。
- en: Secondly, consideration must be given to the protections afforded to more senior
    workers under such future market-oriented arrangements. As a future worker approaches
    retirement, it may be the case that the market prices their work differently compared
    to that of a senior worker – particularly more physical work where a *Bit task*
    such as a day of scaffolding maybe priced at a discount by the market owing to
    the inevitable reduction in physical ability associated with older age which comes
    to us all. These off market price variations could punitively affect the incomes
    of our more senior workers, the corollary of which would be discounted younger
    worker rates, although the later may be more acceptable in a future economy because
    such workers will be less skilled or experienced.

- en: The above contract would be bought and sold for a price known as a premium where
    the seller of the option contract would receive the premium and the buyer of the
    option would pay the premium. Such a transaction in the secondary markets could
    be traded and recorded on a decentralised exchange using a blockchain platform,
    which let us not forget is simply a ledger or database capable of real-time use
    by multiple stakeholders. Stakeholders interested in the trading of such contracts
    would be speculators, corporations, trade unions and individuals to name but a
    few. Simply, speculators have little interest in procuring or selling the future
    labour but rather they take a view whether this contract is under or overpriced
    today then trade accordingly. For example, if I believe that demand for solicitors
    in Singapore will increase going forward owing to my expectation for a buoyant
    property market over the next half decade then I would also expect the market
    rate for conveyancing labour to increase with the passage of time. This option
    contract gives the holder the right to sell such labour for USD 800.00 per day.
    However, if the labour rate increases to USD 1,000.00 per day then the option
    is *out of the money* as who would want to sell at USD 800.00 using this option
    contract when they could sell at USD 1,000.00 in the open market? Consequently,
    the premium would fall to say USD 6,500.00 to reflect this. A speculator with
    the above opinions on future market movements would therefore sell the above put
    option today for USD 14,500.00 then buy it back in the future for USD 6,500.00,
    thereby making an USD 8,000.00 profit per put option contract. Notice that at
    no time does the speculator have any need for the underlying asset – the labour.
    It should also be understood that the maximum gain for this short put trade is
    USD 14,500.00 in the scenario where the premium falls to a price near nil. However,
    the maximum loss is potentially infinite and would occur when demand for such
    labour plummets allowing holders of the put option to sell at the guaranteed price
    of USD 800.00 per day which in turn would make the option contract desirable and
    the premium would rise.^([1](#fn1))

- en: Individuals and trade unions (or their future equivalents) would be interested
    in buying such a put option as it afford them future income protection. If you
    were such a conveyancing solicitor in Singapore and you wished to protect your
    future income owing to your mortgage repayment obligations, then the purchase
    of this option would assist you. Your risk would be a reduction in your future
    wage below USD 800.00 per day. If this occurred, the put option above would be
    *in the money* and would allow the holder to sell said labour at a rate which
    is now greater than the prevailing market rate. The premium would increase to
    reflect this and the solicitor could sell the contract to close their position
    for a profit which will offset their employment losses in the real world. The
    upshot being that they can now meet their mortgage repayments as they fall due
    using both their now reduced employment income alongside their derivatives trading
    profit. In summary, this trade has afforded the worker, or collection of workers,
    a minimum wage but at a cost. Insurance always comes at a cost. It seems unlikely
    that future *Bitworkers* will become expert in derivatives trading with respect
    to their own labour. Perhaps more reasonably such protections will be managed
    by trade unions or DCOPs, in return for a fee, on behalf of a pool of workers
    in a common profession.

  zh: 个人和工会（或将来的等价物）将对购买此类认沽期权感兴趣，因为它为他们提供了未来的收入保护。如果你是新加坡的一名房地产律师，并希望保护自己未来的收入以应对抵押贷款偿还义务，那么购买这种期权将对你有所帮助。你的风险将是未来工资低于每日
    USD 800.00。如果发生这种情况，上述认沽期权将*实值*，并允许持有人以高于当前市场利率的价格出售所述劳动力。保险费将上涨以反映这一情况，律师可以出售合同以平仓获利，从而抵消现实世界中的就业损失。总的来说，这项交易使工人或工人集体获得了最低工资，但也付出了代价。保险总是有代价的。未来*比特工作者*可能不太可能成为自己劳动力的衍生品交易专家。也许更合理的是，这样的保护将由工会或DCOPs管理，以代表一批共同职业的工人收取费用。
- en: Employers too would surely not miss out on the benefits of trading such derivative
    option contracts. Presently, many corporates engage in hedging strategies to mitigate
    external price fluctuations of variables (such as commodity prices) which are
    important to their business operations. This is recorded in their accounts under
    International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39\. It therefore follows that these employers
    would be keen to manage their often significant employment costs in a similar
    way. To continue with our example, a legal firm in Singapore would be exposed
    to increasing wage demands from their staff. They would therefore need to trade
    the previous put option such that as the wage rate increases they will make money
    from their derivative trade which will offset their loss in the commercial world.
    The employing legal firm will therefore sell the put option now for USD 14,500.00\.
    If the wage rate then begins to climb in the commercial world, the put option
    premium will fall as it will become less desirable to hold. The employer will
    then buy the put option back to close out their position making said gain.

    USD 14,500.00。如果随后商业世界的工资率开始上升，认沽期权的保费将下降，因为持有它将变得不太理想。雇主随后将买回认沽期权以平仓并获得所述收益。
- en: A well-functioning secondary market for these derivatives would allow trade
    unions to negotiate pay deals with employers through these disintermediated markets
    rather than protracted rounds of negotiations, brinkmanship and the potential
    threat of strike action. Unions could facilitate the sale of blocks of aggregated
    future labour time for their membership ensuring that they receive the best possible
    market rate. However, it is questionable whether the marketisation of future labour
    would enable workers of the future to receive better pay deals using this mechanism.
    Despite this price (wage rate) uncertainty, the forward sale of future labour
    would serve as an enhanced retainer system of sorts providing the worker with
    security that hitherto was not there. However, that does beg the question of what
    would happen if either counterparty was unable to provide or consume labour? For
    example, the employer closed their operation and had no need of the future labour,
    or perhaps the worker wished to move location of careers and therefore was unwilling
    to make good on their commitment for future labour. In any well-functioning economy
    such flexibility is required. Provisions would therefore need to be incorporated
    into the legal terms (or indenture) of such derivatives making provision for such
    occurrences and perhaps a mechanism for financial compensation in either direction.
    Leaving prepaid employment early may therefore require the worker to buy themselves
    out of the contract to which they are presently engaged.

  zh: 一个功能良好的衍生品二级市场将允许工会通过这些去中介化的市场与雇主进行薪资协商，而不是经过漫长的谈判、边缘政策和潜在的罢工威胁。工会可以促进未来劳动时间的聚合块的销售，以确保他们获得最佳的市场价格。然而，值得怀疑的是，未来劳动的市场化是否能让未来的工人通过这种机制获得更好的薪资协议。尽管存在价格（工资率）不确定性，但未来劳动的提前出售将作为一种增强型保留系统，为工人提供此前不存在的安全保障。然而，这引发了一个问题，即如果任何一方无法提供或消费劳动会发生什么？例如，雇主关闭他们的业务并且不需要未来的劳动，或者工人希望转移职业位置，因此不愿履行他们对未来劳动的承诺。在任何一个运作良好的经济中，这种灵活性是必需的。因此，必须在这些衍生品的法律条款（或契约）中纳入这种情况的规定，并且可能需要在任何方向上提供财务补偿的机制。因此，提前解除雇佣关系可能需要工人自己购买他们目前所承诺的合同。

    block the development of a competitors business played out and planned using game
    theory scenario optimisation. Notwithstanding this possibility, the ability to
    nationalise a current private industry now becomes infinitely more complex. For
    example, the Labour Party (the official opposition in the UK) have pledged to
    renationalise the rail system in the UK should they come to power. However, in
    a world where labour can be traded and forward sold not only would the assets

    but also any associated future labour time in that industry.

- en: Perhaps more interestingly, this also offers the opportunity for a new hybrid
    type of nationalisation, namely *nationalisation of labour*. This would involve
    the state purchasing all future labour available in a given industry deemed to
    be of national importance. This would allow the political powers of the day to
    ensure fair wages and conditions which is usually a key driver for nationalisation
    in the first place. Critically however, the assets of businesses could remain
    in private hands and would not be part of the nationalisation process thereby
    making such an effort cheaper for the state and ergo the taxpayer likewise. In
    addition, moving industry from state to private hands is often a cumbersome, costly
    and lengthy process. It is typically a seismic decision made and desired infrequently
    due to these prohibitive costs and the politically charged opinions on both sides
    of the debate as to whether an industry belongs in state or private hands. This
    new *nationalisation of labour* process which we propose is quicker and less prohibitive
    but also quicker to implement in either direction granting Governments more flexibility

    provide them with the cryptocurrency monetary system with which their customers
    can purchase said goods and services. In a joint statement in September 2019 both
    France and Germany’s Finance Ministers reacted strongly explaining that, ‘no private
    entity can claim monetary power, which is inherent to the sovereignty of nations’.
    Nonetheless, the development of what may become corporate central banks is possible.

    one-for-one. Then, encourage customers and employees to use it thereby stimulating
    demand, before removing the asset backing akin to the removal of the gold standard
    in the previous century to give us the fiat currencies that we use as our functional
    currencies today. The timing of the tipping point when trust of the corporate

    payment of employment taxes for the worker of the future, at both the employer
    and employee level. Presently, such taxes are typically deducted at source for
    employed persons with a frequency of weekly or monthly in arrears. The employer
    is responsible for such deductions as well as the payment of their own employment
    taxes to the tax authority in aggregate. For self-employed persons, the burden
    of tax owing and payments to be made falls squarely upon their own shoulders given
    the absence of an employer. This usually involves an annual or biannual submission,
    or self-assessment, along with responsibility for such workers to maintain appropriate
    records to substantiate their tax paid, or not paid as the case may be. Furthermore,
    documentary evidence to substantiate earnings and tax allowable expenses to reduce
    profits, and therefore taxes owed, must be retained for many years. In the UK,
    for example, this is required for seven years. This administrative burden can,
    and should, be relieved by the virtues of a blockchain ledger which can host data
    (invoices and receipts), to substantiate both earning and deductions in an immutable
    form which tax authorities can evaluate with confidence.

    deliver the largest changes in this area of the economy. Irrespective of whether
    the future of money is cryptocurrencies, corporate currencies, the securitised
    self or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), one thing is clear – the continued
    trend is for cheaper, faster and more transparent transactions. It is this reduction
    in the cost of transactions to nil or near-nil costs that will enable the previously
    discussed Internet of Things economy by virtue of the newly found viability for
    the microtransactions. Such transactions were previously oftentimes crowded out
    by fees, but in this future scenario, the propensity to spend and earn in smaller
    discrete units is now possible. If payment is possible in smaller increments of
    time, it therefore follows that the tendering and allocation of tasks in smaller
    time units will also perhaps occur. This further supports the potential for work
    to be tendered and performed in increasingly small units of time as proposed in
    our *Bit task* above. Similarly, for taxation, the worker of the future will be
    remunerated at the microtask and therefore also the microtransaction level. The
    contemporaneous production, consumption and payment for economic activity remove
    significant friction from value-added economic activities thereby improving the
    economy as a whole. Furthermore, the necessity for monthly, quarterly, biannual
    or annual payments to national tax authorities may no longer be required. Instead,
    taxation owed will be accrued and paid in real time thereby reducing the bureaucracy
    of tax accounting and payments, which not least will negate the need for extensive
    accounting rules in this area regarding the over- or underpayment of tax owed,
    for example, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheets
    of corporate entities. These balances are in essence only due to timing differences
    caused by our technological inefficiencies which in our envisioned future ‘world
    of work’ will no longer be evident therefore mitigating the need for an entire
    accounting standard –IAS 12 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities. No mean feat
    a measure of the potential impact of these new technologies!

- en: From a macro perspective, the future of work that we envisage and have discussed
    thus far, although not without its challenges, would appear to be one in which
    workers are technologically enabled, with greater future income security and with
    less administrative drag. However, this perspective will likely not accrue to
    all members of society in a uniform manner. As previously discussed, demographics
    of perhaps older non-professional work activities are perhaps more likely to miss
    out on these advantages owing to the lower price point, lack of desirability and
    overall commoditisation of their worker behaviour. At the political level, this
    will take extreme sensitivity and creativity of policymaking to ensure equity
    and support in the interests of a cohesive society. Often in nature and economics,
    we may expect to observe a Pareto Effect here, more commonly known as the 80:20
    rule. Founded upon the research of the medieval economist Vilfredo Pareto, he
    found that 80% of the wealth of a nation might reasonably be expected to be wielded
    by just 20% of the population. Moving forward, we observe that modern businesses
    might expect for 80% of their profits to accrue from just 20% of their customer
    base, or perhaps that they spend 80% of their labour time servicing just 20% of
    their customers by number. If a *Pareto Effect* is observed in the disruption
    which is to come in the future of work, it seems unpalatable that any economy
    could stomach one fifth of their working population being left-behind. The societal
    disruption would be significant, to say the least, and would add further fuel
    to the fire behind the rise of angry societies and populism trends the world over.
    However, should these changes manifest over a generation rather than a much shorter
    timeframe then becomes more plausible that such changes could creep into normal
    being in our economy. Similarly, the previously discussed halving of trade union
    membership over the previous generation discussed earlier demonstrates how significant
    change can take hold if introduced over a generation rather than a short period
    of time.

  zh: 从宏观的角度来看，我们所设想并至今讨论过的工作未来，虽然并非没有挑战，但看起来似乎是一个使工人们技术上得以发展，未来收入更有保障，且行政负担更少的未来。然而，这种观点可能不会以统一的方式适用于社会的所有成员。正如之前所讨论的，也许老年非专业工作活动的人口由于价格较低、缺乏吸引力和整体工人行为的商品化更有可能错过这些优势。在政治层面上，这将需要极度敏感和创造性的政策制定，以确保在一个有凝聚力的社会利益中的公平和支持。在自然和经济学中，我们通常可以期待在这里观察到巴雷托效应，更常被称为80:20法则。根据中世纪经济学家维尔弗雷多·巴雷托的研究，他发现一个国家80%的财富可能合理地预期只由20%的人口掌握。展望未来，我们可以观察到现代企业可能期望从他们的客户群中的80%获得利润，或者他们可能花费80%的劳动时间为数量仅占20%的客户提供服务。如果在未来工作中发生了巴雷托效应，任何经济都不可能容忍五分之一的劳动人口被抛在后面。社会的动荡将是相当显著的，并将进一步助长全球愤怒社会和民粹主义趋势的火焰。然而，如果这些变化在一代人而非一个更短的时间框架内显现出来，则这种变化渗透到我们的经济中成为正常现象的可能性更大。同样，之前讨论过的贸易工会会员资格在上一代人中减半的情况表明，如果在一代人的时间内引入重大变化，这种变化是可以产生影响的，而不是在短时间内产生影响。
- en: 'Perhaps one way to ensure equitable treatment during the implementation of
    the triumvirate is to mirror the technological disruption at the political and
    central bank level also? However, for us to think of this as an implementation
    is perhaps somewhat inaccurate. As with all paradigm shifting technological innovations,
    it is difficult for regulatory powers and nation states to hold their technological
    adoption at bay. This is especially true for cryptocurrencies which although they
    have failed to achieve significant adoption they have failed to go away quite
    simply because the benefits which they bring are too great to warrant their elimination.
    Although, it should also be noted that to ‘get rid’ of such cryptocurrencies would
    present some significant challenges, for example, the use of quantum computing
    to undermine a decentralised community, convincing global users that there should
    be no demand for such currencies or perhaps a uniform global electrical switch-off
    in order to render the underlying blockchain ledger as irreparably damaged. It
    is for these reasons why it seems likely that cryptocurrencies will be present
    and therefore have an impact in our future world of work despite the fact that
    we cannot presently identify which of the non-mutually exclusive forms of possible
    future money depicted in the previous diagram will ultimately become dominant.
    The notion of a dominant design or dominant logic is apparent here perhaps more
    so because we are discussing a standard unit of account based upon technological
    fundamentals. Historically, our technological evolution has seen the creation
    of new technologies which bring both good and bad facets from a societal and economic
    perspective; examples include: the telephone, the internet, electricity and now
    the algorithms, blockchain and cryptocurrency (ABC) of our triumvirate. Extrapolating
    this impact at a national and supranational level, we could perhaps envisage a
    decentralised world bank. This would be transparent by design and would allow
    the global financial system to form a meta decentralised DCOP to better support
    the workers of the future at the regional, national and global levels. With a
    mandate to control inflation and provide full employment where possible we may
    go further and see the creation of an algorithmic welfare state. Such a welfare
    system would build upon the seminal work of Wood et al. (2019) who discuss the
    autonomy and algorithmic control in a global gig economy with a particular focus
    upon online labour platforms. These labour platforms upon which their study is
    based are in existence today and seek to match providers of paid work with potential
    workers. However, at a global level, we might anticipate that such platform solutions
    may become problematic for two key reasons. Firstly, owing to the fact that such
    organisations are often for-profit then invariably some of the value which is
    exchanged between worker and the provider of work will be lost to the private
    enterprise. If however, such an allocation of labour was performed on the previously
    discussed DEXs then this value would be retained by the counterparties rather
    than lost to the platform or website. Furthermore, one might envisage that particularly
    with semi-skilled and non-skilled labour that there is the propensity for the
    equilibrium labour rates to disproportionately fall as we perhaps see a race to
    the bottom in willing labour to be performed at ever lower rates in return for
    scarce work. Akin to a reverse auction theory and the winner’s curse it could
    be hypothesised that left unchecked then labour at the individual level may lose
    out in the performance of labour at rates less than their individual marginal
    utility. Once again, we might perhaps return to the role trade unions and how
    if such technological frameworks are put in place then our need for such organisations
    will increase in order to mitigate the race to the bottom risk.'

- en: 'Extending the theoretical marketisation of labour described above, we might
    further postulate that the associated welfare might flex in tandem with these
    labour exchanges, ultimately being controlled by algorithms. The algorithmic welfare
    state would draw upon many of the principles discussed by Rosenblat and Stark
    (2016) to enable verification of worker status and need in terms of whether a
    welfare payment or support is required. Theoretically, this could be applied in
    real time and would help to plug the gig economy slack which arguably current
    and future workers are/will experience. Presently, an agency worker has uncertainty
    of income by definition but when welfare support is warranted and much needed
    by the worker it is unable to flex in alignment with the provision of work. Often
    workers must wait many weeks for welfare systems (and payments!) to catch up oftentimes
    not due to cash flow reasons but rather overly bureaucratic and old systems which
    are unable to keep pace with the new economic environment and technologically
    enhanced normative work denominated in *Bit tasks*. Such a dynamic welfare system
    would allow the flexibility of work performed and work provision to more ably
    flourish owing to the reduced hurdles in using such a platform for income provision
    from the perspective of the worker. If future workers have surety of welfare support
    during fallow times, even at the Bit task level, then the risk of such work and
    associated income streams diminishes. A welfare state which is able to algorithmically
    verify your eligibility for welfare support and pay that in response to small
    periods of time when work provision is unavailable is technologically possible.
    In such a world, a future worker may in the course of a single day completed a
    dozen or so tasks for as many organisations whilst also receiving a 7% welfare
    support for the 1 hour and 20 minutes during which work was unavailable. The aggregate
    outcome being a living wage is perhaps met if not exceeded. Furthermore, because
    these welfare payments and Bit task engagements would likely be hosted on an immutable
    underlying blockchain, or similar, then the state can also with confidence levy
    taxes using similar time increments. If such a system is reliable enough to substantiate
    welfare payments then it is also reliable enough to warrant income tax deductions
    at source. A near frictionless system! Larger-scale events could also be verified
    by oracles and feed into such taxation and welfare cash movements. Example might
    include: marriage tax allowances, family credit tax support post the birth of
    a son or daughter or perhaps automatic statutory sick pay when verified to an
    external system signed-off by a medical doctor. The advantages to such a verifiable
    and real-time system are evident. However, by virtue of the fact that algorithms
    will be able to see and therefore evaluate holistically at the Bitworker level
    it will mean that taxation, for instance, is levied and paid at the appropriate
    marginal rate even if a worker is drawing income from multiple Bit task engagements
    concurrently. The worker onus to keep records, declare and pay taxation at fixed
    time points is therefore removed thereby allowing the worker to earn in a more
    uniform and predictable manner which reduces risk despite no change in the per
    annum after tax cash inflows.'

  zh: 将上述理论化的劳动市场商品化进一步延伸，我们可能进一步假设相关的福利可能会与这些劳动交换同步波动，最终由算法控制。算法福利国家将借鉴罗森布拉特和斯塔克（2016）讨论的许多原则，以验证工人的身份和需求，确定是否需要福利支付或支持。从理论上讲，这可以实时应用，并有助于填补当前和未来工人可能面临的零工经济不足。目前，代理工人的收入不确定性是明显的，但当工人需要福利支持时，它无法与工作提供的安排保持一致。通常，工人必须等待许多周才能等到福利制度（和支付！）赶上，这往往不是由于现金流原因，而是因为过度官僚化和老旧系统无法跟上新经济环境和技术增强型的规范工作，以
    *Bit 任务* 计价。这样一个动态的福利体系将允许工作执行和工作提供的灵活性更好地蓬勃发展，因为从工人的角度来看，使用这样一个平台来提供收入的障碍减少了。如果未来的工人在荒芜时期能够确保获得福利支持，即使在
    Bit 任务水平上，那么这样的工作和相关收入流的风险也会减少。一个能够通过算法验证你的福利支持资格并在工作提供不可用的短时间内做出支付的福利国家在技术上是可能的。在这样一个世界中，未来的工人一天之内可能会为十几个组织完成大约十几项任务，同时在工作不可用的1小时20分钟内获得7%的福利支持。总体结果或许已经达到了或者超过了生活工资。此外，因为这些福利支付和
    Bit 任务参与可能会托管在一个不可变的底层区块链或类似的平台上，那么国家也可以自信地使用类似的时间间隔征收税款。如果这样的系统足够可靠以证实福利支付，那么它也足够可靠以在源头扣除所得税。一个几乎没有摩擦的系统！更大规模的事件也可以由神谕来验证，并纳入这种税收和福利资金流动。例如，婚姻税收津贴、生儿育女后的家庭税收支持，或者可能是在外部系统得到医生签字确认后的自动法定病假工资支付。这种可验证且实时的系统的优势是显而易见的。然而，由于算法将能够在
    Bitworker 级别全面看到和因此评估，这意味着，例如，即使工人同时从多个 Bit 任务参与中获取收入，税收也将按适当的边际税率征收和支付。因此，工人记录、申报和在固定时间点支付税款的责任被移除，从而使工人能够以更加统一和可预测的方式赚取收入，从而减少风险，尽管年度税后现金流入没有改变。

    of money. Whichever prediction wins out it will be required for workers to become
    comfortable at managing income streams denominated in multiple currencies whether
    they be: fiat, cryptocurrencies, CBDCs, non-sovereign corporate currencies or
    perhaps even currencies denominated in the tokenised self. In managing such currencies,
    there will be exchange rate risk exposure as invariably the types of currencies
    agreed upon with respect to the matched work within a crowdwork platform will
    be varied. Exchange rate risk will be evident for future workers as despite the
    value of the income hopefully exceeding the value of their outgoings it is likely
    that the currency mixes will not match perfectly.^([2](#fn2)) It may be the case
    that as part of the allocation process of labour workers are able to stipulate
    a preferred remuneration currency however what is more likely is that the currency
    denomination of advertised work will be fixed therefore forcing the worker to
    bear the risk. A possible solution to this may be the transference of exchange
    rate risk to the tax authority in that non-fiat currencies could be accepted to
    settle tax payments. Even if acceptable it should be noted that firstly nation
    states may be unwilling to allow this as it legitimises the unrecognised currency
    of earnings potentially to the detriment of their own national fiat currency.
    Nonetheless, this may not be as outlandish as it first sounds because presently
    the state of Ohio in the USA permits payment of local taxes by individuals in
    the form of Bitcoin, and has done so since early 2019.^([3](#fn3)) Secondly, taxes
    may only represent 10–50% of outgoings of an individual depending upon their tax
    strategy and domicile. It is likely that outgoings will largely be denominated
    in fiat currency and would typically include: mortgage repayments, utility bills,
    credit card fees, loans and general spending. Such exchange rate risk could simply
    be absorbed by the individual or perhaps could be neutralised with an extremely
    low-cost algorithmic broker who would convert incoming currencies to the required
    outgoing currencies to create a near perfect match in real time. From the future

    denomination 将被固定，因此迫使工作者承担风险。解决这个问题的一个可能方案是将汇率风险转移给税务机构，即非法定货币可以被接受以结算税款。即使是可以接受的，也应该注意，首先，国家可能不愿意允许这样做，因为这将合法化未被承认的收入货币，潜在地损害了他们自己的国家法定货币。尽管如此，这可能并不像听起来那么离奇，因为目前美国俄亥俄州允许个人以比特币的形式支付地方税款，自2019年初以来一直如此。其次，税款可能仅占个人支出的
    10-50%，具体取决于他们的税务策略和居住地。支出很可能主要以法定货币计价，并且通常会包括：抵押贷款偿还、公用事业费、信用卡费用、贷款和一般开支。这种汇率风险可以被个人轻松吸收，或者也许可以通过一个极低成本的算法经纪人中和，他会将收到的货币转换为所需的支出货币，实时创建几乎完美的匹配。从未来工作者的角度来看，汇率风险的概念因此变得无关紧要。
