- en: If you’re planning on operating a blockchain startup in New York City, plan
    for extra fees. In June 2015, the New York State Department of Financial Services
    (NYDFS) put out the final version of Bitlicense, the regulatory framework for
    digital currency aimed to give the industry more clarity. In reality, it pushed
    many blockchain startups out of NYC. The license itself costs $5,000 and can be
    up to 500 pages. It requires the fingerprints of each company’s leaders and an
    extensive background check on the applying businesses. The chief complaint is
    the roughly $100,000 in expenses associated with the application. This estimate
    includes time allocation, legal, and compliance fees. Bitlicense is in stark contrast
    to the efforts made by other financial centers such and London, Singapore, and
    Dubai.

  zh: 如果你计划在纽约市经营一个区块链初创公司，请为额外费用做好准备。 2015年6月，纽约州金融服务部（NYDFS）发布了Bitlicense的最终版本，这是针对数字货币的监管框架，旨在为该行业提供更多清晰性。
    实际上，这推动了许多区块链初创公司离开了纽约市。 执照本身的费用为5000美元，可能长达500页。 它要求每家公司领导的指纹以及对申请业务的广泛背景调查。
    最大的投诉是与申请相关的约10万美元的费用。 这个估计包括时间分配，法律和合规费用。 Bitlicense与伦敦，新加坡和迪拜等其他金融中心所做的努力形成鲜明对比。
- en: The final Bitlicense was the result of almost two years of research and debate

    that the existing regulations were not suitable for digital currency companies.

- en: On a positive note, NYC blockchain businesses no longer need approval from the
    NYDFS for new software updates or further rounds of venture capital funding. The
    framework states that digital currency firms only need approval for changes that
    are “proposed to an existing product, service, or activity that may cause such
    product, service, or activity to be materially different from that previously
    listed on the application for licensing by the superintendent.”

- en: The first company to receive a Bitlicense was Circle, the Bitcoin wallet providers.
    The license allows them to operate in New York under the regulatory framework.
    Circle is one of the few companies that can legally do so. Most blockchain startups

    the benefit. Only the highest-funded startups are making an effort.
