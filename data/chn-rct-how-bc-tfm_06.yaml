    an intercity bus in Zambia. I bought my ticket in advance at the ticket office.
    Each ticket has an assigned seat number. As we boarded the bus, staff loaded passengers’
    luggage, ranging from backpacks and suitcases to sacks of potatoes and live chickens
    bound at the legs. Food sellers crowded around the bus, peddling samosas through
    the window. The conductor checks our tickets. If an assigned seat isn’t available,
    he phones the local booking office to request a new seat number and updates the
    ticket. While the driver navigates the potholes and skirts around goats, cows
    and occasional elephants crossing the road, the conductor records which seat numbers
    are actually occupied and calls ahead to ticket offices along the route to tell
    them the seat numbers available so that they can ensure that they only sell available
    seats. The process is time consuming and leads to plenty of misunderstandings.

    So, why not use a traditional database? The UK has a very successful register
    of movable property called Immobilise, which is a traditional database maintained
    by a private company with the support of the police. This system requires the
    public to trust both the police and the company that operates the database to
    maintain the validity and security of the data and to ensure that it isn’t misused,^([3](#Fn3))
    and the police need the skill and time to design and implement such a system.
    By contrast, with a blockchain-based system, trust lies with the programmer who
    designed the system rather than with the local authority that operates it. One
    could imagine a credible international organization—or indeed the UK Police, with
    their experience of operating such a system—taking responsibility for the programming
    and deployment of the blockchain-based property registration system, allowing
    people around the world in developing countries to benefit through adopting a
    similar approach. Adding a token as compensation for using the system would just
    complicate a very straightforward use case.

    with penetration of the smartphone becoming the single tool for banking and identity.
    Mobile integrates brilliantly with the technology behind digitized securities.
    For a long time accessing the capital markets has been dependent on having a stock
    broker or at least access to a desktop computer. Soon you will only need a smartphone.
    This opens the door to whole new demographic of participants. Emerging markets
    are the obvious starting place for this technology. It is harder to implement
    transformational tech in developed markets where you’re competing with well-established,
    dominant infrastructure players.

  zh: 新兴市场和前沿市场有可能出现一种跃进效应，正如我们已经看到电信和银行服务一样，智能手机的普及成为银行和身份的单一工具。移动设备与数字化证券背后的技术完美融合。很长时间以来，进入资本市场一直依赖于拥有股票经纪人或至少
    access to a desktop computer。很快，你只需要一部智能手机。这为全新的参与者群体打开了大门。新兴市场是这项技术的明显起点。在发达市场中实施变革性技术更加困难，因为你正在与基础设施领域已经建立起来的、占据主导地位的玩家竞争。

- en: 'This is an evolution, not a revolution. Consider the old world: share certificates
    lived in the drawer in your desk. Toward the end of the last century, there was
    a move from paper records to electronic versions of certificates. However, the
    underlying approach was still the same and even though the ownership was recorded
    electronically, there was still a huge amount of record keeping required. All
    individual actors in the custody chain would keep their own records and these
    would be reconciled frequently—often with errors. Settlements teams at banks spend
    hours and days trying to resolve instructions that do not match. This system is
    ripe for an overhaul and distributed ledger technology is the obvious way to do
    it.'

  zh: 这是一个进化，而不是革命。考虑一下旧世界：股票证书放在你办公桌抽屉里。20世纪末，从纸质记录过渡到电子证书版本。然而，基础方法仍然相同，尽管所有权是电子记录的，仍然需要大量的记录工作。所有保管链中的个人都会保留自己的记录，这些记录需要经常对账——常常出现错误。银行结算团队花费数小时和数天时间试图解决不匹配的指令。这个系统亟待改革，分布式账本技术是显然的解决方法。
- en: The system of distinct centralized databases, with all of their inherent vulnerabilities,
    would be replaced with a single shared ledger that records the ownership of securities
    as digital tokens. They carry with them a complete record of their characteristics
    and ownership history, as the token is passed back and forth on the ledger. The
    potential here is to remove lots of administrative effort, reduce errors, shorten
    settlement times potentially to zero and unlock significant sums of tied-up capital.
    It makes sense for the securities industry to move in this direction but there
    are significant structural reasons why it is not so easy.

  zh: 由各个不同的中央化数据库组成的系统，以及它们固有的所有脆弱性，将被一个单一共享账本所取代，该账本记录证券的所有权作为数字代币。这些代币携带其完整特性记录和所有权历史，随着代币在账本上传递，这些信息随之传递。这里的潜力在于，可以消除大量的行政工作，减少错误，将结算时间
    potentially 缩短至零，并释放大量被锁定的资本。证券行业向这个方向发展是有意义的，但存在一些重大的结构性原因使得这并非易事。

    them with new incentives and consensus created something entirely new in Bitcoin.
    If you think of Bitcoin as digital currency built on a distributed ledger, the
    next evolution was Ethereum which took the idea of a digital currency and extended
    the idea of smart contracts to broaden the application beyond just currency. Tokenization
    is really an extension of that philosophy.

    As such we believe that more and more securities will be issued on blockchain
    and DLT networks, outside of the traditional centralized transfer agent and central
    securities depository (CSD) driven databases and systems. MERJ is connecting its
    end-to-end financial market infrastructure to as many of these networks as possible
    to enable securities and investors from all over the world to participate. This
    is why we describe our model as a truly global securities exchange. Digital securities
    will enable new business models that leverage the dynamic nature of a token. Whether
    this is in governance models, shareholder activation, rewards, who knows. It’s
    not our job to design the models; it’s our job to provide the infrastructure that
    allows them to succeed.
