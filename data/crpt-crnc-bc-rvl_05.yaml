- en: In the decade since Bitcoin was created, at least $15 billion worth of cryptocurrency
    has been stolen. This number could be even larger, as some thefts go unreported.
    Since 2017 alone, crypto thieves have made off with nearly $2 billion. These attacks
    have become increasingly sophisticated and organized. They take advantage of popular
    misperceptions of what makes a blockchain secure and supposedly unhackable. Like
    every security system invented, blockchain has both strengths and weaknesses.

  zh: 自比特币诞生以来，已有至少价值15亿美元的加密货币被盗。这个数字可能还更大，因为有些盗窃事件没有报道。仅自2017年以来，加密货币小偷就几乎盗走了20亿美元。这些攻击变得越来越复杂和有组织。它们利用了人们对区块链安全的普遍误解和所谓的不可破解性。像所有发明的安全系统一样，区块链也有优点和缺点。

- en: 'Many security breaches occur not in the cryptocurrencies themselves but in
    the exchanges on which they are stored. Exchanges are like a combination of banks
    and marketplaces: they connect buyers and sellers and hold assets—in this case,
    cryptocurrencies—in accounts. These accounts differ from the private keys associated
    with blockchain because they are connected to individuals. As a result, cryptocurrency
    exchanges contain sensitive information about account holders and, most importantly,
    the holders’ cryptocurrency keys.'

  zh: 许多安全漏洞并非出现在加密货币本身，而是出现在它们存储的交易平台上。交易平台就像银行和市场的结合体：它们连接买家和卖家，并在账户中持有资产——在这种情况下，是加密货币。这些账户与与区块链关联的私钥不同，因为它们与个人相连接。因此，加密货币交易所包含了关于账户持有人的敏感信息，最重要的是，持有人的加密货币密钥。
- en: At its peak in 2013, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world.
    The exchange had been built by Mark Karpelès, a French-born computer programmer
    who had settled in Tokyo. As the price of Bitcoin soared, Karpelès appeared to
    revel in his wealth. He donated 5,000 Bitcoins to the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization
    dedicated to developing Bitcoin software, and joined its board. Employees reported
    that he would suddenly approve $400 lunches for the staff or interrupt business
    to order flat screen TVs for the exchange’s Tokyo headquarters.

  zh: 2013年，Mt. Gox达到了顶峰，成为世界上最大的比特币交易所。该交易所是由出生于法国的计算机程序员马克·卡佩莱斯（Mark Karpelès）建立的，他定居在东京。随着比特币价格的飙升，卡佩莱斯似乎沉溺于他的财富之中。他向致力于发展比特币软件的组织——比特币基金会捐赠了5000枚比特币，并加入其董事会。员工报告称，他会突然批准为员工支付400美元的午餐，或中断业务为东京总部订购平板电视。
- en: Mt. Gox’s apparent success proved to be a facade. In truth, Mt. Gox had been
    hacked in 2011, and thieves had gained access to private keys throughout the exchange.
    Over four years, they stole some 850,000 coins from online wallets. In February
    2014, the exchange collapsed into bankruptcy. More than $400 million vanished.
    Investors around the world lost money, and investor confidence in cryptocurrencies
    suffered another severe blow.

    Nilsson）。尼尔森对加密货币的潜力和前景充满热情。他在2012年开始购买加密货币，并在一年后开设了Mt. Gox交易所的账户。

    to work. The thieves had withdrawn the coins from the exchange over several years.
    Nilsson was able to search through transactions and detect patterns. Though blockchain
    addresses are anonymous, Nilsson was fortunate in that parts of the Mt. Gox database,
    including private records of trades, withdrawals, deposits, and user balances,

    One of the most common approaches was the most intuitive: subject smart contracts

    not be successfully applied to real-world problems. In 2006, he noted, Walmart
    tried to track the movement of individual bananas and mangoes from trees on a
    farm to shelves in a store. The effort failed because of the difficulty in getting
    everyone on the supply chain to enter data. A decade later, Walmart tried again,
    this time using blockchain. To Stinchcombe, the very framing of the problem and
    solution was absurd. If mango pickers did not like to enter produce information
    into a data tracking system, the solution was not “let’s create a very long sequence
    of small files, each one containing a hash of the previous file.”

    to know if a smart contract—written in computer code—could be trusted? You must

    of buying an e-book. Say you bought a book directly from a novelist, and the smart
    contract arrived on your computer. The contract should state how much money will
    be withdrawn from your account for the delivery of the book. Reading through the

- en: The point, said Stinchcombe, is that blockchain was not trustless—it simply
    asks people to trust technology rather than other people. This makes some sense—after
    all, we trust technology to conduct vital tasks all the time. But in reality,
    we’re actually trusting a third party to verify that the technology can be trusted.
    Blockchain, therefore, puts the task of verifying trust back on to the individual.
    This requires extraordinary knowledge, resources, and time. And this, according
    to Stinchcombe, makes blockchain far less effective than its supporters claim.
