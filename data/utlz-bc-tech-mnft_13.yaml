  zh: 引言
- en: Nearly 25 years ago, consumer satisfaction with customer service was the focus
    of business research. Business consultants, companies, and operational management
    have worked together to identify the characteristics of companies that consistently
    delight their customers, develop techniques for measuring customer satisfaction,
    and implement continuous quality improvement mechanisms that respond to customer
    feedback. Customer service and satisfaction are essential for every firm looking
    to evaluate its performance and guarantee its survival, regardless of whether
    the study was performed by and for the business sector. Product prices gradually
    increased throughout the 1950s and 1960s, resulting in many crises and restricted
    buying power. Business consultants were looking for a solution that balanced customer
    happiness, cost, and quality. Furthermore, the fierce competition at the period
    pushed businesses to seek a competitive edge. According to the study, logistics
    management may help a company achieve customer satisfaction, cost, and value advantage.

  zh: 将近25年前，消费者对客户服务的满意度成为商业研究的焦点。商业顾问、公司和运营管理人员共同努力，以确定持续让客户满意的公司的特征，制定衡量客户满意度的技术，并实施响应客户反馈的持续质量改进机制。对于每家希望评估其业绩并确保其生存的公司来说，客户服务和满意度都至关重要，无论该研究是否由商业部门进行。20世纪50年代和60年代，产品价格逐渐上涨，导致许多危机和购买力受限。商业顾问正在寻找平衡客户满意度、成本和质量的解决方案。此外，当时的激烈竞争推动企业寻求竞争优势。根据研究，物流管理可能帮助公司实现客户满意度、成本和价值优势。
- en: 'Transportation fleet management, order fulfilment, logistics design, inventory,
    supply, and third-party logistics service provider administration are all examples
    of logistics management. Customer service, sourcing, procurement, production planning,
    scheduling, packing, and assembly are all examples of logistics management. Logistics
    management is an important part of strategic, operational, tactical, and operational
    planning and execution at all levels (Achumba.,et.al,2013). In today''s competitive
    market, businesses must run at peak efficiency and provide great service to be
    profitable. In the fast moving consumer products sector, three variables have
    been discovered to influence warehouse efficiency and effectiveness: warehouse
    management system simplicity/complexity, product slotting methods, and warehouse
    layout design. The capacity of the company to efficiently manage the warehouse,
    minimise costs, and fulfil orders is crucial to its success. It is important to
    note that warehouse management presents significant difficulties for businesses.
    Because of changes in the way raw materials, intermediate commodities, and final
    products are handled, the function and significance of warehouses in the American
    economy has shifted significantly(Albernaz.,et.al, 2014). Warehouse management
    is becoming more generally recognized as a necessity in today''s market, where
    customer satisfaction and service have become a crucial element in a company''s
    capacity to stand out from the competitors. To ensure optimal performance throughout
    the business, the warehouse operating system must be built for receiving inventory,
    fast order fulfilment, automated validation of warehouse operations, and accurate
    inventory management.'

  zh: 运输车队管理、订单执行、物流设计、库存、供应以及第三方物流服务提供商管理都是物流管理的例子。客户服务、采购、采购、生产计划、排程、包装和装配都是物流管理的例子。物流管理是战略、运营、战术和各级规划和执行的重要组成部分（Achumba等人，2013年）。在今天竞争激烈的市场上，企业必须运行在最高效率，并提供优质的服务才能盈利。在快速消费品行业，发现了影响仓库效率和效益的三个变量：仓库管理系统的简单性/复杂性、产品存放方法以及仓库布局设计。企业能够有效地管理仓库、降低成本并履行订单的能力对其成功至关重要。值得注意的是，仓库管理对企业而言存在着重大困难。由于原材料、中间产品和最终产品处理方式的变化，仓库在美国经济中的功能和重要性发生了显著变化（Albernaz等人，2014年）。仓库管理在当今市场上越来越被普遍认识为是一项必要性，其中客户满意度和服务已成为企业脱颖而出的关键因素。为了确保企业各个环节的最佳性能，仓库操作系统必须建立在接收库存、快速订单执行、仓库操作的自动验证和准确的库存管理的基础上。
- en: The success of physical product distribution relies heavily on the warehousing
    network. Leading companies are seen to use and execute various warehousing techniques,
    including as capacity switching, hub networking, cobbling, and outsourcing. For
    enhancing warehouse design techniques, both analytic and simulation models are
    suggested. Analytic models are often design-oriented, which means they look at
    a lot of different options rapidly to find a solution. Simulation models, on the
    other hand, are often analysis-oriented. They can offer an opinion on a design,
    but they are generally restricted in their capacity to explore the design area.
    To gain more flexibility in evaluating warehouse issues, both methods must be
    integrated. Aside from new supply chain trends, technological advancements have
    a significant effect on storage. Many formerly manual activities have now been
    mechanised or even automated. Robots may be employed to arrange arriving goods
    on pallets in an automated warehouse (Dobler Burt.,et.al,2006). Each pallet's
    contents are transmitted to a central computer, which allocates the pallet to
    a vacant storage space. Incoming pallets are transported to the storage buffer
    by conveyors or guided vehicles, and pallets are stored in the correct location
    in the storage area by automated Storage/Retrieval equipment.

  zh: 物理产品配送的成功在很大程度上依赖于仓储网络。领先的公司被看到使用和执行各种仓储技术，包括容量切换、枢纽网络、拼凑和外包。为了增强仓库设计技术，建议同时使用分析模型和仿真模型。分析模型通常是设计导向的，这意味着它们能够迅速查看许多不同的选项以找到解决方案。另一方面，仿真模型通常是分析导向的。它们可以对设计提出意见，但通常受限于探索设计领域的能力。为了在评估仓库问题时获得更多的灵活性，必须将这两种方法整合起来。除了新的供应链趋势外，技术进步对储存也有重大影响。许多以前手工进行的活动现在已经机械化甚至自动化。机器人可以被用来在自动化仓库中整理到货物品到货架上（Dobler
    Burt等人，2006年）。每个货架的内容都被传输到中央计算机，该计算机将货架分配到空闲的存储空间。到货的货架通过输送带或引导车辆被运送到存储缓冲区，并且货架由自动化存储/检索设备存储在存储区的正确位置。
- en: The part of the supply chain process that organises, executes, and manages the
    efficient, effective, forward, reverse flow, goods, services, related information
    of origin, and point of consumption in order to meet customer requirements, according
    to the Council of Logistics Management. In layman's terms, having the right product
    in the right location at the right time in the right condition means having the
    right thing in the right place at the right time in the right condition. On the
    other side, the supply chain includes all of the processes involved in fulfilling
    a customer's request. It starts with the supplier and extends to production, distribution,
    retail, and, finally, the customer (Kandampully.J.,et.al, 2003). Supply chain
    management is the management of goods, information, and money as they move through
    the supply chain from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to customer.
    Developing new technologies, businesses may gain strategic competitive advantages
    in a variety of management activities, such as logistics and supply chain management.
    The application's degree of success, on the other hand, is determined by the technology
    it employs, as well as the presence of appropriate organisational infrastructure,
    culture, and management practises. In the logistics sector, information, communication,
    and automation technologies have dramatically improved the speed with which data
    is recognised, collected, processed, analysed, and sent while maintaining a high
    degree of accuracy and dependability. Technology can help businesses improve their
    competitiveness and performance. It makes a major contribution to supply chain
    performance by enhancing the logistics system's overall performance and efficiency.
    Many modern technologies are utilised in logistics in industrialised countries,
    but acceptance in India is sluggish. As the Indian economy liberalises, competition
    is intensifying, and the only way to stay ahead of the pack is to invest in technology-enabled
    processes (C.R. Kothari et al., 2008).

    customer expectations and needs for more value-added products and services(Chepkoeh.A,et.al,2019).
    The most important approach for manufacturing companies to succeed in today's
    competitive market is to offer value-added, high-quality, and creative products.
    To remain competitive, many Malaysian industrial firms have implemented a variety
    of improvement initiatives and established new operational philosophies (Cooper.D.R,
    et.al,2015). Since the 1980s, SCM has gradually grown in popularity in manufacturing
    firms and has become an essential component of company strategy.

- en: Due to rising consumer demand, digitization in the supply chain and logistics
    network is becoming more dynamic. This digitization provides simple access to
    consumer requirements by efficiently sharing product/service delivery tracking
    information. The tracking information is guaranteed by the integration of businesses
    involved in the supply chain process, whose job it is to create mapping between
    different systems. The integration of data or information across different companies
    usually resulted in high expenses and sluggish dissemination. This study looks
    at how blockchain technology may be used to integrate supply chains. This technology
    works by integrating with the cloud, which provides a cost-effective business
    strategy for digital supply chains. Furthermore, via increased visibility, this
    technology may aid in the disruption of digital supply chain networks. Continuous
    monitoring is possible with such visibility, resulting in better supply chain
    performance. Due to the inherent dangers, adoption of this technology in the logistics
    and supply chain sector is sluggish, and some businesses are cautious about its
    deployment. However, it is anticipated that blockchain will gain the required
    trust and extend its acceptance across all industries.

    sector, which continues to be one of the most underutilized areas in the country.
    While the distribution centre market is inefficient in its oversight, it may cause
    major disruptions across the manufacturing network. The ability to associate with
    areas in India is no longer particularly reassuring, as it has resulted in substantial
    losses in the item's transportation, dispersion, and capacity. Given India's significant
    development in organized retail and producing activities, market testimonies are

    management, and even rhocrematics have all been utilised. Regardless of its name,
    business logistics is an important part of management in most companies, whether
    they are manufacturing or service-oriented. The process of planning, executing,
    controlling, efficient, cost-effective, raw materials, stocks, products, and related
    information from point of origin to meet customer needs, as defined by the Council
    of Logistics Management. The global economy is becoming more linked than ever
    before. Companies are pursuing, or have already implemented, global strategies
    in which their goods are intended for a worldwide market and manufactured wherever
    low-cost raw materials, components, and labour are available, or they produce
    locally and sell globally. Supply and distribution lines are stretched in both
    instances as compared to a company that wants to produce and sell locally. Not
    only did the trend emerge naturally as a consequence of businesses seeking to
    save costs or expand their markets, but it was also helped by trade-friendly government
    frameworks. As businesses adopt a more global perspective of their operations,
    logistics performance and costs will play a larger role in globalization/internationalization.
    Since a result, logistics becomes more important inside the company, as logistics
    expenses, particularly transportation costs, account for a substantial portion
    of overall costs. If a business wishes to locate foreign suppliers for its resources
    or produce its products in other countries, for example, the goal is to earn more
    money. Although material and labour costs may be cheaper, if transportation and
    inventory costs increase, logistics costs are likely to rise as well. Shows a
    compromise that may result in a greater profit by cutting material, labour, and
    administrative costs but sacrificing logistics and tariffs. Outsourcing improves
    the supply chain's value, but it requires tighter logistics cost control to product
    management.

    a consistent interface for solution developers, which opens up new commercial
    possibilities. The ELPIF architecture offers a single generic interface on which
    any Shipping Service Providers may develop their Web Services and then register
    them in UDDI Registries so that other businesses can discover and utilize them.
    The ideas contained in ELPIF may be extended to various domains, even though we
    are focused on the shipping sector.Shipping services would be able to follow a
    paradigm of what might be termed a generic shipping service by integrating Web
    Services with a common interface approach. This is important because it enables
    a shipping service client to create code that uses the generic shipping model
    and then use the dynamic data binding method to access a particular shipping service
    implementation at run time. Developers do not need to alter their development
    environments to create or utilize Web Services since they can be implemented in
    any programming language. As a result, the architectural flexibility of our framework
    may benefit any client application. XML enables the transmission of business data
    across businesses in most integration systems by offering a cross-platform solution
    to data encoding and data formatting. SOAP, for example, is based on XML and provides
    a straightforward method to package data for transmission between systems. UDDI
    enable programmable components to be put on remote-accessible Web sites. We can
    not only offer interoperability for our clients, but we can also utilize our multi-platform
    approach to create superior products and solutions that enable any industry to
    conduct transactions quickly and effectively by using the aforementioned technologies.

- en: The management of product transit between the point of origin and the site of
    consumption in order to satisfy specific needs, such as those of consumers or
    companies, is referred to as logistics. Food, liquids, and abstract notions like
    time, information, particles, and energy are all part of logistics. Information
    transfer, material handling, manufacturing, packing, inventory, shipping, storage,
    and, in certain cases, security are all part of the logistics of physical things.
    Dedicated simulation tools may be used to simulate, analyse, visualise, and optimise
    logistics complexity. Import and export logistics are driven by the desire to
    utilise as little resources as feasible. Despite the fact that the preceding definition
    of logistics is not universal, it is likely to be accepted in this case. The Council
    of Logistics Management, now known as the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals,
    defines inventory management as the process of planning, implementing, controlling,
    and ensuring an efficient and effective flow of goods, services, and information
    from point of origin in order to meet customer requirements.

    concentrated on logistics infrastructure, transportation, and inventory planning.
    The term supply chain management seems to be even less defined than logistics.
    According to the authors, SCM has been poorly defined, and “there is a considerable
    degree of variation in people's views. Nonetheless, we provide a generally accepted

- en: The words logistics and supply chain are frequently used interchangeably in
    academics and business because they are intimately related to product circulation
    over its whole life cycle, and both have been considered as the fundamental unit
    of competitive analysis in model management science. The phrase “supply chain”
    refers to a broader notion that encompasses, among other things, network sourcing,
    supply pipeline management, value chain management, and value stream management.
    Furthermore, since the supply chain is made up of a range of organisations, the
    majority of which are businesses, the idea of logistics has nothing to do with
    the concept of organisation, which is the polar opposite of supply chain. One
    of the most significant aspects of supply chain management is that businesses
    want to enhance the supply chain as a whole rather than cutting costs or increasing
    profits at the expense of their supply chain partners. As a result, one of the
    most fundamental supply chain management ideas is that supplier networks, not
    individual companies, compete. Game theory, like incentive theory, is an essential
    study technique for supply chain management in situations when information is
    lacking.

    with plant capacity, storage capacity, shipping capacity, and disaggregated demand
    at the retail level. Another essential guideline to follow in the MPS-SCM system
    is the customer service level. This idea is based on a number of distinct performance
    metrics. The order fill rate refers to the percentage of client requests that
    are fulfilled from stock. There is no need to consider supplier and production
    wait times for this small percentage of client orders. At every level of the system,
    the order fill rate may be assessed in terms of a central warehouse, a field warehouse,
    or stock. The stock out rate is the inverse of the fill rate, and it shows the
    number of orders that are lost due to a stock out. The number of backordered orders
    is the total number of orders that have not yet been fulfilled. To offer the greatest
    possible customer service, order fill rate, stock out rate, and backorder levels
    must all be optimized. Another measure is on-time delivery probability, which
    is defined as the proportion of customer orders completed on time, that is, before
    the agreed-upon date. Manufacturing Logistics is concerned with the opportunities
    and difficulties presented by a certain industry. These options allow for the
    deployment of a collection of critical resources to assist industrial processes,

    customer end-item needs and fulfilling them starts with manufacturing logistics.
    The planning, scheduling, and management of all operations that result in inventory
    acquisition, processing, shipping, and storage is known as manufacturing logistics.
    Order acceptance, production planning and scheduling, inventory management, inventory
    distribution, and the creation of related decision procedures and decision support
    systems are among these tasks.

    of theories. When the players may get a larger benefit by working together rather
    than alone, the former applies. Because transportation and customer happiness,
    which are variables in this research, need a high degree of global collaboration
    among all supply chain actors, this theory applies in this case. Collaboration

    the foundation of competitiveness in many sectors in the future age of hyper-competition,
    both implicitly and openly. As a consequence of supply chain analysis waste or
    duplicate activities, suppliers and logistics networks are urged to synchronies
    and minimize non-core operations. Regardless of the difficulties, developing a
    dependable and efficient supply chain may become a core skill, if not a differentiator,
    for any business. Supplier relationships and collaborations are critical in hotel
    logistics and supply chain management. Long-term cooperation benefits both the
    business and its suppliers by allowing them to profit from a direct, long-term
    connection while also encouraging collaborative problem-solving and planning.
    These strategic alliances allow hotels to work successfully with a select group
    of essential suppliers that are eager to share product success and cooperate to
    save time and effort. Client satisfaction rises as a result of relationships,
    and they are less likely to move on to the next hotel. As customer customization
    and personalized service have become more important, building relationships has
    become more important for company sustainability. Hotels may use the relationships
    to differentiate themselves from their competitors, keep customers loyal, and
    pass on value.
