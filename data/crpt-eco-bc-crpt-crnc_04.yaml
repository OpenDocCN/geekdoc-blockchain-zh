- en: Let’s go back to 2008 again. The subprime mortgage crisis that flattened the
    economy that year proved a boon for storytellers, and not just in cryptocurrency
    books. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the 2011 movie Margin Call, but it’s worth
    your time. I would especially recommend it if you’re interested in the financial
    industry’s (dys)function, and how profoundly it influences every aspect of our
    daily lives. The movie basically limns the situation immediately prior to the
    financial crisis. A risk-management analyst has caught a mistake and suddenly
    understands the hit that his industry is about to take—and what the impact may
    be for the rest of the world. The film is revealing because it lays bare the philosophy
    and attitude underpinning the whole of Wall Street, namely, that risk is usually
    not identified and acknowledged during times when the system seems to be working
    fine and everybody is making money. But as greed grows, things always spiral out
    of control. The financial industry manages trillions of dollars worth of assets.
    The whole world, in some fashion or another, relies on Wall Street to function
    correctly. When it doesn’t, trust is shaken and everybody is impacted.

    Call》，但值得你花时间。如果你对金融行业的（不良）功能以及它如何深刻地影响我们日常生活的每一个方面感兴趣，我特别推荐它。这部电影基本上描绘了金融危机前夕的情况。一位风险管理分析师发现了一个错误，突然明白了他的行业即将遭受的打击——以及这可能对全世界产生的影响。这部电影之所以揭示性强，是因为它揭露了整个华尔街的哲学和态度，即在系统似乎运行良好且每个人都赚钱的时候，风险通常不会被识别和承认。但随着贪婪的增长，事情总是失去控制。金融行业管理着数万亿美元的资产。全世界，以某种方式或另一种方式，都依赖于华尔街的正确运作。当它不能正常运作时，信任就会动摇，每个人都受到影响。

  zh: 根据Vocean的说法，当前金融行业有三个关键的弱点。然而，Vocean相信它将能够引入基于区块链的效率，以解决所有这三个问题。
- en: First, traditional banking services suffer from “low efficiency” management
    of their funds and records. The sheer amount of transactions they must record
    are huge. All too frequently, banking information is stored in different computer
    terminals, or on slow computer networks. Because of the information delays this
    creates, traders at investment banks are less able to make quick and fully informed
    decisions on behalf of their investors.

  zh: 首先，传统银行服务在资金和记录管理上存在“低效率”的问题。他们必须记录的交易量巨大。银行信息经常存储在不同的计算机终端上，或者在速度较慢的计算机网络上。这种信息延迟造成了投资银行交易员在代表投资者做出快速且完全知情的决策时能力降低。
- en: Second, financial service firms still need third parties to complete the clearinghouse
    function. A clearinghouse is a financial institution that facilitates the exchange
    of payments, securities, or derivatives. Essentially, it functions as a middleman
    connecting two firms. It also ensures that both firms honor their agreements and
    fulfill their obligations. You could view a clearinghouse as a kind of early-stage
    PayPal. PayPal provides not only a platform on which transactions can take place,
    but it also facilitates the transaction between the buyer and the seller. PayPal
    usually charges a 3 percent fee for its services, much like a clearinghouse. After
    the buyer submits a payment, PayPal will hold it temporarily and release it when
    the buyer confirms the receipt of the merchandise. In the traditional financial
    marketplace, clearinghouses are necessary to reduce costs and mitigate operational
    risk.

  zh: 第二，金融服务公司仍然需要第三方来完成清算所的功能。清算所是一家金融机构，它促进支付、证券或衍生品的交换。本质上，它充当两家公司之间的中间人。它还确保两家公司遵守其协议并履行其义务。你可以把清算所看作是早期阶段的**PayPal**。PayPal不仅提供一个可以进行交易的平台，而且还促进买方和卖方之间的交易。PayPal通常对其服务收取3%的费用，这与清算所类似。在买家提交支付后，PayPal会暂时持有它，并在买家确认收到商品时释放它。在传统金融市场中，清算所是降低成本和减轻运营风险所必需的。
- en: The third problem Vocean can address is the need for security in cryptocurrency
    by means of a “custodian.” Exchange desks and wallet services have not proven
    foolproof. Hacking incidents do happen from time to time. The resulting security
    and safety issues are a barrier for many large institutional investors. As long
    as they entertain the specter of “losing money because of a hack,” they will be
    reluctant to do business related to blockchain or cryptocurrency. Yet the traditional
    financial industry has developed effective custodians for investors to help them
    store and manage their fiat money and traditional assets. JPMorgan Chase, State
    Street Bank, and Mellon Finance, for example, have been keeping in their custody
    billions of assets on behalf of other institutions for years. As crypto assets
    have increased, the need for similar custodian services has become clear. In May
    of 2018, Coinbase—an American Bitcoin exchange and wallet service platform—began
    providing its own version of custodian service. Adam White, the VP of Coinbase,
    says he is anticipating billions of institutional investment dollars in this connection.
    And according to the May 2018 issue of Cointelegraph, Nomura Bank, a Japanese
    financial institution, announced that it would begin providing a “crypto custody
    solution” for institutional investors. Nomura’s venture will be conducted in partnership
    with digital asset security company Ledger and with the investment house Global
    Advisors. And according to a recent piece in the New York Times, ICE, the parent
    company of the NYSE, has been developing an online trading platform for Bitcoin
    SWAP.

  zh: 第三个问题是Vocean可以解决的，即通过“托管人”为加密货币提供安全性。交易台和钱包服务并非万无一失。黑客事件时有发生。由此产生的安全和安全问题对许多大型机构投资者构成了障碍。只要他们考虑到“因为黑客攻击而损失资金”的可能性，他们就会不愿意进行与区块链或加密货币相关的业务。然而，传统金融行业已经为投资者开发了有效的托管人，以帮助它们存储和管理其法定货币和传统资产。例如，摩根大通、州街银行和梅隆金融已经多年来代表其他机构保管数亿资产。随着加密资产的增加，对类似托管服务的需求变得明确。2018年5月，Coinbase——一个美国比特币交易所和钱包服务平台——开始提供其自己的托管服务版本。Coinbase的副总裁Adam
    White表示，他期待着数十亿美元的机构投资资金。根据2018年5月《Cointelegraph》的报道，日本金融机构野村银行宣布将开始为机构投资者提供“加密托管解决方案”。野村的这次尝试将在与数字资产安全公司Ledger和投资公司Global
    Advisors合作的情况下进行。据《纽约时报》最近的一篇报道，ICE——纽约证券交易所的母公司——一直在开发一个比特币SWAP在线交易平台。

    different from what’s being offered by traditional banking services? Foremost,
    Jerry Zhong believes that blockchain will greatly increase the efficiency of investing
    and all related financial services. A big part of this will be the use of smart
    contracts. Since the smart contract is irreversible, terms can (and will) be executed
    without human intervention. Things will be automatic. Further, all the data are
    stored on the public chain, which will be accessible to all parties involved in
    a transaction and which will considerably lower costs (especially when compared
    to the traditional price point of managing collateral posted to banks).

  zh: 当涉及到这三个关键问题时，Vocean认为它可以利用区块链技术提供解决方案。Vocean的解决方案将如何与传统银行服务提供的解决方案不同呢？首先，Jerry
    Zhong相信，区块链将大大提高投资及相关金融服务的效率。这其中的很大一部分将是智能合同的使用。由于智能合同是不可撤销的，条款可以（并且将会）在没有人工干预的情况下执行。一切都将自动化。此外，所有数据都存储在公共链上，这将对参与交易的所有各方都可见，并且将显著降低成本（尤其是与传统银行管理抵押品的价格相比）。
- en: Vocean is moving forward by building upon the public chain made possible by
    Ethereum. Zhong has explained that his ultimate purpose is to maximize outcomes
    by minimizing the costs and time inputs associated with financial transactions.
    Vocean believes the infrastructure of Ethereum has been proved solid. The customers
    targeted by Vocean are financial institutions who put safety and privacy as the
    two issues at the top of their lists. Are there any trade-offs or challenges?
    The big one is speed. Currently, Ethereum can process fifteen transactions per
    second. That might sound like a lot, but Visa can put up about 45,000 transactions
    per second. Even so, Vocean believes this hurdle in manageable, and that speed
    will improve over time. Vocean is also constructing two smart contract systems.
    One smart contract system will manage the “borrow-lend” function, which connects
    borrowers, lenders, and mortgage management entities. Through the system, these
    three parties can execute semisimultaneous trades. The other smart contract system
    will serve the function of the clearing-houses we discussed above. Due to the
    complexity of the market, price is in a constant state of fluctuation and adjustment.
    Vocean is developing a specific smart contract to manage collateral in this environment.
    When a huge (up or down) price change triggers a margin call, the system will
    protect the value of assets and serve the best interests of credit holders.

  zh: Vocean是在以太坊实现的公共链上前进的。Zhong解释说，他的最终目的是通过最小化金融交易的成本和时间输入来最大化结果。Vocean相信以太坊的基础设施已经得到了证明是稳固的。Vocean的目标客户是将安全和隐私作为首要问题的金融机构。是否有任何权衡或挑战？最大的挑战是速度。目前，以太坊可以每秒处理15笔交易。这听起来可能很多，但Visa可以处理大约每秒45,000笔交易。即便如此，Vocean认为这个障碍是可以克服的，并且速度会随着时间的推移而提高。Vocean还在构建两个智能合同系统。一个智能合同系统将管理“借入-借出”功能，该功能连接借款人、贷款人和抵押管理实体。通过该系统，这三方可以执行半同步交易。另一个智能合同系统将履行我们上面讨论的清算所的功能。由于市场的复杂性，价格处于不断波动和调整的状态。Vocean正在开发一个特定的智能合同来在这种环境中管理抵押品。当出现巨大（上升或下降）的价格变动触发保证金调用时，该系统将保护资产价值并服务于信贷持有者的最佳利益。
- en: Vocean will also work to enable cross-chain crypto transactions. In traditional
    financial situations, borrowers and lenders make exchanges across different currencies
    all the time. Bitcoin and Ether, however, are traded in separate public chains,

- en: As I think you can see, Ethereum has become the fundamental infrastructure in
    much of the blockchain and cryptocurrency world. Despite its prevalence, it still
    isn’t perfect. Blockchain can be seen as a data storage facility that offers a
    high level of security, but at the cost of low speed. It is not suitable for complicated
    logic functions, or for repeatable trades of low value. Vocean aims to balance
    its reliance on Ethereum with other in-chain and off-chain services. In so doing,
    it hopes to be able to provide the best of both worlds.

    the space, their concern is that they would need a considerable amount of crypto
    to offset risk and increase liquidity. Often, investment banks solve this issue
    using “swap and repo”—also known as a repurchase agreement. In a typical repurchase
    agreement, a dealer sells securities to a counterparty with the agreement to buy
    back the securities at a higher price at a later date. If the dealer borrows money,
    it is a repo. If the dealer lends money, it is a reverse repo. Once the crypto
