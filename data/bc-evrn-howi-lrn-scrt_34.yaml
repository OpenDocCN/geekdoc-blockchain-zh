- en: I looked around the small funeral home, filled with family and friends. Jade
    was there in the front row with her family, all the kids and grandkids. Kirk,
    Ben, and Evan sat a few rows back with their families, wedged between cousins
    and aunts. I looked back at my brother-in-law’s body, surrounded by flowers and
    wreaths.

  zh: 我环顾了这间小殡仪馆，里面充满了家人和朋友。翠玉和她家人坐在前排，所有的孩子和孙子。柯克、本和埃文带着他们的家人坐在后面几排，挤在表亲和姑姑之间。我回头看着我姐夫的遗体，周围是鲜花和花圈。
- en: '“This is one of the four noble truths of the Buddha: life involves suffering.
    But that’s not the way we think, is it? We think that life should be easy. We
    complain about our hardships. The weather. The president. The line at the grocery
    store.'

  zh: “这是佛陀的四个 noble真理之一：生命涉及痛苦。但这是我们思考的方式吗？我们认为生活应该容易。我们抱怨我们的苦难。天气。总统。杂货店的队伍。
- en: “But today is truly difficult. Today we suffer because . . .” I took a breath
    to steady myself. “. . . because Joel is no longer with us.”

  zh: “但今天真的很困难。今天我们会痛苦是因为……。”我深吸一口气来稳定自己。“……因为乔尔不再和我们在一起了。”
- en: I took a sip of water to hold it together. “Why do we never say these things?”
    I asked. “I’ve never heard a eulogy where someone just comes out and says, ‘This
    is really difficult.’ It’s always words of comfort. But isn’t it the greatest
    comfort to know that we are not alone, that we all suffer together?

  zh: 我喝了一口水来保持镇定。“我们为什么从来不说这些事情？”我问。“我从未听过一个悼词中有人直接说，‘这真的很困难。’ 总是安慰的话语。但难道不是知道我们并不孤单，我们共同承受痛苦才是最大的安慰吗？
- en: “Today is a change,” I continued, “and change is also difficult. Consider the
    caterpillar morphing into a butterfly. Think about that for a second. It’s a worm
    with legs, folks. And it turns into this delicate winged angel. You go from bird
    food to the cover of Nature magazine. Do you think that’s easy? Wrapped in that
    cocoon, mutating its body? Got to be difficult.

  zh: “今天是一个改变，”我继续说，“而改变也是困难的。想想毛毛虫变成蝴蝶的过程。花一分钟想想吧。这是一个有腿的虫子。然后它变成了这个精致的翅膀的天使。你从鸟食变成了《自然》杂志的封面。你认为这是容易的吗？在茧里，包裹着它的身体？一定很困难。
- en: “The snake shedding its skin. The tree adding to itself layer by layer. The
    universe expanding. How could these things be easy? They must involve great struggle.
    They must be difficult.

  zh: “蛇脱去它的皮。树一年一年地长出新的层次。宇宙在扩张。这些事情怎么可能容易呢？它们一定涉及到巨大的挣扎。它们一定很难。
- en: “Saint Paul, in his letter to the Romans, said, ‘I do the things I don’t want
    to do, and I don’t want to do the things I do.’ Or something like that. You didn’t
    get a real pastor today; you got me.”

- en: “Paul’s point is that we all struggle. We struggle to do the right things, and
    we struggle to avoid the wrong things. The struggle is what makes us human. It
    is that struggle that gives us dignity, and worth, and self-respect. Today we
    honor those qualities in Joel.

  zh: “保罗的观点是我们所有人都在挣扎。我们挣扎着做正确的事情，我们也在挣扎着避免错误的事情。挣扎是我们成为人类的原因。正是这种挣扎赋予我们尊严、价值和自尊。今天我们纪念乔尔身上的这些品质。
- en: “Talking with you all, I’ve heard the ways in which Joel’s humanity—the person
    that he was beneath the struggles—touched our family and, in his own way, made
    the world a better place.

  zh: “和你们交谈，我听到了乔尔的人性——他在挣扎之下的人——如何触动我们的家庭，以他自己的方式，使世界变得更美好。
- en: '“My question for you today is: Can we struggle well? Can we struggle as Joel
    did? Can we struggle with this loss, accepting its difficulty but still embracing
    it? Can we look death in the face?” I paused, my emotions pushing for release.'

  zh: “我今天要问你们的问题是：我们能很好地挣扎吗？我们能像乔尔那样挣扎吗？我们能接受这种失去的困难，但仍然拥抱它吗？我们能直面死亡吗？”我停顿了一下，情感急于释放。
- en: “Because if we can struggle well, my friends, that is a life worth living.”
    I turned to face Joel. “Just as Joel’s was a life worth living.”

- en: I held it together for the rest of the service, until the final viewing. Over
    those cheap funeral home speakers came the voice of Johnny Cash singing his version
    of the Beatles classic “In My Life.” And not a young Johnny Cash; this was the
    timeworn, weather-beaten Johnny Cash.

  zh: 我在仪式的其余时间里都保持着镇定，直到最后的遗体告别。那些廉价的殡仪馆扬声器里传来了约翰尼· Cash演唱的甲壳虫乐队经典曲目《在我生命中》的版本。不是年轻的约翰尼·
    Cash，而是历经岁月风霜、饱经世事的约翰尼· Cash。
- en: As people silently filed past to pay their final respects, Jade and I broke
    down in each other’s arms.
