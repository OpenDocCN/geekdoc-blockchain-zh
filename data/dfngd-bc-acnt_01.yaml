  zh: 5.1. 引言
- en: Smart contracts is arguably the most widely known component of blockchain technology.
    The term smart contracts is synonymous with self-executing contracts, blockchain
    contracts or digital contracts. In this process, traditional contracts are converted
    into computer codes, then stored and replicated on the system. These codes are
    supervised by a network of computers and facilitate the exchange of money, property,
    shares or other assets in a transparent fashion. In essence, smart contracts are
    computer codes that automatically execute a transaction when pre-specified conditions
    are satisfied. The computer program automatically validates that the pre-specified
    condition has been satisfied and then determines how the assets should be redistributed
    between the participants of the underlying transaction. The decentralized ledger
    stores the conditions and conducts the eventual transaction in an immutable, tamper-free
    form which provides security and validity.

- en: Nick Szabo, a computer scientist and a cryptographer, developed the concept
    of “smart contracts” in the mid-1990s, almost a decade before the advent of blockchain
    or Bitcoin. Though he did not name these as “smart contracts” these were self-executory
    contracts which did not require a trusted third party (Szabo, 1999). His initial
    motivation was to reduce transaction costs to enable microtransactions. Subsequently,
    he expanded on the concept of establishing contract law to facilitate transactions
    between strangers over the internet. Szabo had introduced a virtual currency in
    1998, called “Bit Gold,” which did not gain much popularity or traction. However,
    Bitcoin exploited many of the same features and popularized the notion of “smart
    contracts.”

    1999）。他最初的动机是降低交易成本，以实现微交易。随后，他将合约法的概念扩展到促进互联网上陌生人之间的交易。萨博在1998年推出了一种名为“比特金”（Bit
    Gold）的虚拟货币，但这种货币并没有获得太多人气或关注。然而，比特币利用了许多相同的特点，并普及了“智能合约”的概念。
- en: Smart contracts are not merely a compilation of pre-conditions and rules around
    an agreement, but they also auto-execute those rules and obligations. Hence, smart
    contracts have to be supported by technology that is able to determine when the
    pre-conditions have been satisfied. Smart contracts are essentially lines of computer
    codes that contain “if-then” rules and are stored on a blockchain. When the conditions
    “ifs” are met, the code executes on its own and delivers the output, the “thens.”
    These can be used in business transactions where both parties agree upon the decided
    terms.

- en: As an example, suppose a buyer agrees to make a payment of a million dollars
    upon the delivery of the goods. The buyer then deposits a million dollars in a
    blockchain account and the seller is assured that the funds exist and will be
    released to the seller once the buyer receives the goods. The seller then could
    ship the goods with a tracking device on the shipment. Once the goods are delivered,
    the tracking device shows the destination, this is verified by hundreds of users
    on the blockchain, and the million dollar is released from the escrow account
    to the seller’s account. The buyer can no longer cancel the purchase or refuse
    to pay. The payment was automatic upon the receipt of the goods. This reduces
    the risk of non-payment and consequently the transaction costs.

  zh: 5.2. 智能合约定义
- en: A smart contract is a simple set of business rules that are self-executed once
    the pre-determined conditions have been satisfied. In the traditional setting
    a responsible third-party intermediary, usually a lawyer or an escrow, is assigned
    with the task of ensuring the proper execution of the contract upon the fulfillment
    of the underlying terms and conditions. In the smart contract environment, the
    executory role of the trusted third-party intermediary is delegated to a computer
    code and the verification role is collectively undertaken by the participants
    in the blockchain. The decentralization of the verification process and the automation
    of the execution facilitates the objective and unambiguous satisfaction of the
    pre-condition and enforcing the outcomes. This allows participants to exchange
    items of value in transparent and conflict-free manner, without a third-party
    intermediary.

- en: In current applications, smart contracts are simple business rules that are
    computer coded and automatically verified prior to executing the transaction.
    Smart contracts could be as simple as, “verify that account balance (*B*) exceeds
    transaction amount (*T*), prior to making payment of *T*.” In that instance, when
    the system is presented with a new transaction, it automatically checks the account
    balance, compares the account balance to transaction amount, executes transaction
    when *B* > *T*. In that sense, smart contracts are primarily “if/when—then” statements
    that are coded on a blockchain. A network of computers executes the actions when
    pre-specified conditions have been satisfied.

- en: Let’s consider another more common example, that of selling a house. For anyone
    who has sold a house in the United States knows that it is a rather complicated,
    expensive and daunting process with lot of paperwork and communication between
    many different parties. In the traditional setting, there are multiple parties
    involved in the sale–purchase of real estate property, such as a house. The purchase
    of a house, in the United States, involves obtaining a court-registered document
    or the title, verification that the seller of the property is in fact listed as
    the owner of the property on the title. Additional verification is required that
    there are no outstanding lien on the property. Organizing a closing is often as
    tedious as organizing a wedding. That’s why majority of sellers use a real estate
    agent, who deals with the paperwork and acts as a liaison with various parties,
    until the deal is “closed.” An escrow service helps in these transactions, due
    to the amount of money and the number of parties involved in such transactions.
    There are also lawyers from both sides as well as a Title agent are involved in
    every closing. All said and done, it costs somewhere between 6% and 7% of the
    price of the house, for these many services, which is paid by the seller. A smart
    contract solution for real estate sales hence could have much economic ramification
    for the seller. Most importantly, smart contracts will resolve the trust issue,
    of ensuring that the seller is the legitimate owner of the house and the buyer
    has the funds to pay for the house. The “if-then” principle, in this case would
    ensure that the ownership of the house will be passed on to the buyer only when
    the purchase price is deposited in the system. As the trust between the parties
    is no longer of concern, there is no need for an intermediary, consequently saving
    considerable amount of money to the actual signatories of the transaction, the
    buyer and the seller.

    market, where the tenant deposits funds on a blockchain, which will be released
    to the landlord upon the transfer of the key, an event which is witnessed by all
    participants of the blockchain. If the key does not arrive by the specified date
    on the rental agreement, the funds are refunded to the prospective tenant. The
    smart contract works on the similar “if-then” premise. The system releases the
    key to the tenant provided the funds are in escrow, and releases the funds to
    the landlord once the keys have been transferred to the tenant. Through the mechanism,
    a level of trust is developed in the transaction, even though the landlord and
    the tenant may never have met. The smart contract performs the task of the real

    are unwilling to expend substantial mental energy, or incur cognitive costs, in
    haggling and exhibit the behavior of price takers for their retail purchases.

    to a transaction deposit their deliverable, cash or goods, into the escrow account.
    Once the pre-conditions are met the transfer is auto-completed, without any further
    human intervention. Hence, all the conditions, “if-then” rules and rewards and
    costs must be pre-specified at the outset. The smart contracts do not merely maintain
    documentation of the terms but executes those terms and enforces the conditions.
    In its simplest form, the smart contracts have the following essential components.

- en: First and foremost, the parties to the transaction must be clearly identified.
    As with any contract, the signatories must be identified. In other words, these
    are the individuals or corporations entering into the transaction. The signatories
    are two or more parties that agree with the terms and conditions of the smart
    contract, and have some underlying economic interest in the outcome.

  zh: 首先，交易各方必须明确识别。与任何合同一样，签署人必须被识别。换句话说，这些是参与交易的个体或公司。签署人是指同意智能合约条款和条件并具有交易结果的基础经济利益的两个或更多方。
- en: Second, the outcome or the subject of the agreement must be objectively and
    unambiguously observable. The subject of the agreement must be an item or information
    that exists within the smart contract’s environment. Since the smart contract
    will be auto-executed upon the satisfaction of the terms or the pre-conditions,
    these pre-conditions must be observable to the executors of the smart contract,
    the blockchain participants. All the nodes in the blockchain must have unhindered

  zh: 尽管智能合约的概念自二十世纪末期就已经存在，但实施却花了大约二十年时间。区块链技术提供了执行智能合约所需的必要基础设施，以确保可靠和安全。目前，我们仍然生活在一个基于纸张的合同世界中，其中信任第三方的参与是强制性的。在发达国家，信任第三方会收取高额交易费用，以保持中立和“可信”。在其他交易费用可能较低的社会中，所谓的“可信”第三方可能容易受到贿赂，并在稍后的日期改变合同条款，导致昂贵且耗时的诉讼。
- en: Blockchain facilitated the growth and popularity of Bitcoin by enabling direct
    transfer of assets between two or more parties who did not know or trust each
    other. Incorporation of smart contracts broadens the scope of applications and
    transactions that blockchain can support. It now allows for multipart transactions,
    spanning a longer time period, to occur between parties that do not trust each
    other. Each party to the transaction can inspect the code, that is, read the contract,
    prior to deciding whether or not to participate in the transaction. Each party
    will have the certainty of execution of the contract once the obligation is fulfilled
    or pre-conditions are met. Each party can be assured that the counterparty has
    no ability to amend the contract at a later date or has any further control over
    the terms or execution of the contract. Each party will have the subsequent verifiability
    over the process. Once the transaction is executed, the validity and verifiability
    of the transaction is preserved for ever. In other words, it creates a permanent
    audit trail.

- en: 'Since the term “contracts” is used to describe this technological artifact,
    it is important to discuss that perhaps the use of “contract” is a misnomer, as
    this has very little to do with the legal definition of the term “contract.” To
    reiterate, “smart contracts” are merely coding of simple business logic that can
    be auto-executed and permanent, immutable records of the transaction will be kept.
    The term “contract” has little to do with legal validity of such arrangements.
    In fact, the very characteristics that makes these contracts attractive: decentralization,
    anonymity and automation cause many legal and regulatory issues as discussed in
    this section.'

  zh: 由于“合同”一词被用来描述这种技术 artifact，因此讨论“合同”的使用可能是一个误称很重要，因为这与法律定义中的“合同”一词几乎没有关系。重申一下，“智能合同”仅仅是简单商业逻辑的编码，可以自动执行，并且永久的、不可更改的记录交易。术语“合同”与这些安排的法律有效性关系不大。实际上，使这些合同具有吸引力的特点：去中心化、匿名性和自动化，正是这些特点导致了诸多法律和监管问题，如本节所讨论的。
- en: Typically, a legal contract is between two responsible and known parties who
    are legally permitted to enter into contract in that particular jurisdiction.
    Anonymity or pseudoanonymity is contrary to the notion of legal contracts. In
    public and permission-less blockchain network it may be difficult to ascertain
    who the actors are and where are they located geographically, that is in which
    country’s jurisdiction. Since there is disparity in laws and regulations across
    countries, it is important to know the jurisdiction to ascertain what laws are
    applicable.

  zh: 通常，一份法律合同是在两个有责任感和已知身份的当事人之间签订的，这些当事人在特定的司法管辖区内被法律允许签订合同。匿名或伪匿名与法律合同的概念相悖。在公共的、无需许可的区块链网络中，可能很难确定参与者是谁以及他们地理位置在哪里，即在哪个国家的司法管辖区内。由于各国之间的法律和规定存在差异，了解司法管辖区对于确定适用的法律至关重要。
- en: Legal jurisdictions differ in their definition of “contractual capability.”
    Contractual capability refers to a party’s ability to enter into a contract. In
    Australia, England, France and the United States, anyone under the age of 18 is
    a minor under law, hence cannot enter into a contract. Furthermore, the contract
    is generally voidable at the minor’s choice. Since the parties in a smart contract
    are often unknown to each other, there is no way to verify the age of the signatory.
    Consequently, it is possible that a party may inadvertently contract with a minor
    cloaked by the anonymity afforded by the technology. This threatens the enforceability
    of the agreement (Giancaspro, 2017).

  zh: 法律管辖区在定义“合同能力”方面有所不同。合同能力是指一方签订合同的能力。在澳大利亚、英国、法国和美国，18岁以下的任何人按法律都是未成年人，因此不能签订合同。此外，未成年人通常可以随时撤销合同。由于智能合约中的各方通常彼此未知，无法验证签署人的年龄。因此，一方可能无意中与被技术提供的匿名性所掩盖的未成年人签订合同。这威胁到协议的执行性（Giancaspro，2017）。
- en: The legal profession in most jurisdictions is still archaic and has not kept
    pace with technology. It is unsure if computer code, though mathematically valid,
    can be considered credible evidence in legal setting. Even if it is clear that
    the information and records cannot be tampered with, it is still unclear whether
    it can be presented as “evidence” or whether the transactions are “legally binding,”
    in each and every jurisdiction. Additionally, since blockchain by design is decentralized,
    it is unclear in which jurisdiction is the data stored and whether or not it meets
    the “rules of evidence” in the jurisdiction of legal action. Each network node
    may be subject to different legal requirements, and since there is no central
    administration or hub, the nationality of the “hub” may be questionable and the
    basis of legal argument.

- en: For “smart contracts” to gain international traction on large and complex transactions,
    it may require regulators and lawmakers to collaborate across national borders
    to harmonize legal and regulatory regimes. In 2019 the Chairwoman of the United
    States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an important speech on this
    regard at Singapore. The content of the speech is analyzed in greater detail in

- en: Laws can be effective only if they can be enforced through penalties or sanctions
    against the violators. What is imperative to announcing sanctions is that the
    lawbreakers need to be identified in the first place. The pseudoanonymity provided
    by the technology clearly works contrary to what is expected in law enforcement.
    Additionally, the actual identity of the parties may be kept private based on
    the privacy laws of the jurisdiction where the account (pseudoname) was established.
    Criminals, generally, would leverage on “regulatory arbitrage opportunities” and
    shop for countries and jurisdictions (such as Cayman Islands, Panama, etc.) which
    provide greater protection and preserve anonymity. It should however be noted
    that while there are some platforms that offer anonymity to account holder, the
    two most popular platforms, Bitcoin and Ethereum, do not support anonymity. Governments
    also try to discourage the use of anonymity by imposing anti-money-laundering
    laws.

    fees or government surcharge.
- en: Smart contracts, being automated and self-executed reduces the cognitive costs
    of participants. Once the code is verified and agreed upon, routine transactions
    are undertaken by the computer program, overseen and validated by numerous participants
    of the blockchain, and stored indefinitely and tamper-proof on the block. Thereby,
    smart contract creates an opportunity to make routine transaction and processes
    automated, error-free and objective.

- en: Despite its promise, smart contracts are still prone to “growing pains” and
    potential problems. For starters, since smart contracts rely exclusively on the
    code, its functionality is as good as the code and any problems or bugs in the
    code would have wide ranging ramifications. Bugs in the code could be exploited
    by hackers and scammers. In 2016, there was the DAO hack, wherein funds put into
    a smart account were susceptible to being stolen due to a mistake in the code.[⁶](#fn6)
    There are additional issues that remain to be resolved, such as how would government
    and taxation authorities regulate and tax such contracts. Further, what is a recourse
    if something unforeseen, like a pandemic occurs, how can smart contracts be modified
    or adapted to respond to changing circumstances.

  zh: 尽管智能合约前景广阔，但它仍然容易受到“成长的痛苦”和潜在问题的困扰。首先，由于智能合约完全依赖于代码，其功能取决于代码的好坏，代码中任何问题或错误都会产生广泛的影响。代码中的错误可能会被黑客和诈骗者利用。2016年，发生了DAO攻击事件，由于代码中的一个错误，投入智能合约的资金有可能被盗。[⁶](#fn6)
    还有其他需要解决的问题，例如政府税收当局如何对这种合同进行监管和征税。此外，如果发生无法预见的状况，如大流行，智能合约如何修改或适应变化的情况。
- en: While these problems are ubiquitous, these are magnified in the case of smart
    contracts, due to its novelty. However, since the technology has such promise

    and business transactions.
