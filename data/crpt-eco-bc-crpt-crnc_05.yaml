- en: Essentially, a crypto exchange is a digital marketplace in which traders can
    buy and sell cryptos using different fiat currencies (or other items of value).
    It’s an online platform that acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers.
    A crypto exchange functions similarly to a traditional stock exchange. It matches
    buyers and sellers, allowing customers to make trades.

- en: The first such exchange was a Bitcoin exchange founded in October of 2009\.
    It was named New Liberty Standard and was located in New York. It was a place
    where people could exchange Bitcoins for fiat money, or fiat money for Bitcoins.
    Martti Malmi, an early Bitcoin evangelist, supported New Liberty Standard by investing
    5050 Bitcoins as seed money. In return, he received a whopping $5.02 USD via PayPal.
    When it was launched, New Liberty Standard estimated the value of Bitcoins based
    on the consumption of electricity per Bitcoin cost. Based on this valuation system,
    between October and November of 2009, the exchange rate between Bitcoins and US
    dollars was approximately 1000 to 1.

    for implementing tokens. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment. Today, ERC-20
    drives an increasing amount of tokens into the crypto world through ICOs. ERC-20
    was first proposed in November of 2015, and it functioned such that any token
    that complied with ERC-20 would be compatible with Ethereum wallets. With ERC-20,
    developers can also build apps (DAPPs), and people who build DAPPs usually issue
    tokens as “currency” to be used within the DAPP. These tokens are not allowed
    to be directly traded for fiat money. They have to first be exchanged for Bitcoin
    or Ethereum. However, the creation of ERC-20 is important to the history of exchanges
    because of the “currency within a currency” it makes possible. Clearly, the appetite
    for trading between cryptos is not diminishing.

    rub elbows with speculators and scam artists. Their lack of regulation often creates
    a vacuum in which people can take advantage of one another. In the United States,
    Japan, and South Korea, all exchanges are registered domestically, which means

    crypto market because of their different approach. In June of 2017, Bancor Protocal
    initiated a crowd-funding ICO to establish a multilayered system of currency wherein
    one token could be be “reserved” for another. It aimed to set the new standard
    for cryptocurrency exchanges. (As a decentralized exchange, Bancor Network relies
    on smart contracts to match trades and execute them automatically.) The ICO raised
    $153 million worth of Ethereum. (By then, the market price of Ethereum was $273.)
    It was the most valuable ICO in history at the time. Bancor’s ICO also received
    the endorsement of well-known investors, including Tim Draper, the American venture
    capitalist. (Even though Bancor has a very successful ICO, it would not be correct
    to say it has become “the star” of decentralized exchanges. The twenty-four-hour

    and IDEX.)

    Draper在内的知名投资者的认可。（尽管Bancor的ICO非常成功，但说它成为了去中心化交易所的“明星”并不准确。Bancor的24小时交易量为600万美元，远远落后于Kybernetwork和IDEX等竞争对手。）

    have a lower market barrier than centralized ones. Some ICOs that are less fortunate

- en: The initial listing fee for an ICO on a centralized exchange can be a lot of
    money. How much exactly? Currently, there is no agreed-upon standard. The cost
    of listing an ICO on an exchange largely depends on the liquidity and structure
    of the exchange itself. Exchanges with high liquidity will charge more to list
    an ICO. The cost will also be related to the “heat” of the ICO. During the peak
    of the ICO market in 2017, the cost to list an ICO on a centralized exchange crept
    to between $1 million and $2 million on the top ten exchanges with the highest
    liquidity levels. Compare that to what stock exchanges charge for an IPO. According
    to NASDAQ, the initial listing fee of an IPO is usually between $125,000 and $300,000
    (excluding the yearly listing fee). Yet for many startups and investors, an ICO
    is a much easier way to raise capital. Startups benefit from the low cost of money,
    and early investors like getting in on exciting young technologies before everyone
    else. Keeping ICOs attractive in the future will be the single factor that most
    determines if the success of these exchanges continues. Not all exchanges profit
    through their initial listing fees. Some have instead implemented community voting
    as part of the selection criteria for new tokens, and they charge a small fee
    for each vote. (This helps ensure that fake or fraudulent coins not be introduced
    and also gives the exchange a tidy profit.) Voters pay each time they cast a ballot.
    More votes means more support for an ICO, and more profit for the exchange.

  zh: 在中心化交易所上市ICO的初始费用可能是一笔巨款。具体多少钱呢？目前，还没有统一的的标准。一个ICO在交易所上市的成本很大程度上取决于交易所本身的流动性和结构。流动性高的交易所会对ICO的上市收取更多费用。成本还将与ICO的“热度”有关。在2017年ICO市场高峰期，在流动性最高的十大交易所上市ICO的成本高达100万至200万美元。相比之下，根据纳斯达克的说法，一个IPO的初始上市费用通常在12.5万美元至30万美元（不包括年度上市费用）。然而，对于许多初创公司和投资者来说，ICO是筹集资本的更快方式。初创公司从低廉的资金成本中受益，早期投资者喜欢在其他人之前参与到激动人心的年轻技术中。未来保持ICO的吸引力将是决定这些交易所成功与否的最重要因素。并非所有交易所都通过初始上市费用获利。一些交易所将社区投票作为新代币选择标准的一部分，并收取每次投票的小额费用。（这有助于确保不会引入假冒或欺诈的货币，同时也给交易所带来可观的利润。）投票者在每次投票时支付费用。更多的投票意味着对ICO的支持更多，交易所的利润也更多。

    further than Fcoin. Newly listed tokens go to Bibox first, and the ones who “survive”
    the filtering system will then go to Coinpark. It is essentially an exchange for
    quality tokens!

  zh: 总有新模型不断涌现，我们可以从中学习。Fcoin是另一个好例子，最近成为全球前十的交易所之一。Fcoin在2018年6月引入了“交易即挖矿”的概念，并吸引了众多投资者和交易员。这一模式是在Fcoin商业模式中的一个漏洞被利用后出现的。Fcoin宣布将停止使用30%的推荐费用。公告发布第二天，其交易量下降了5%。但随着“交易即挖矿”模式的推出，它的成功程度超过了以往任何时候！这种“交易即挖矿”的模式创新且令人兴奋，并且其他人也在采用它。例如，Coinpark也已经转向了“交易即挖矿”的格式。然而，Coinpark比Fcoin走得更远。新上线的代币首先上线Bibox，然后经过过滤系统筛选后才会进入Coinpark。它本质上是一个高质量代币的交易平台！

  zh: 加密货币交易所的未来：外部监管与自我监管
- en: The future of crypto exchanges probably depends a lot on the industry’s appetite
    for self-discipline. As I noted at the outset, exchanges are commonly known as
    the “top of the food chain.” They control the ebb and flow of trade and play a
    crucial role in the token economy. Exchanges are not supposed to support insider
    trading in either the prime market or the secondary market. Because of their influence,
    any policy or rule an exchange introduces will probably have a powerful influence
    on the market as a whole. In the early days of crypto, there were many “gray areas”
    when it came to crypto exchanges. Many investors made a fast buck with unethical
    business practices. Yet the crypto exchanges expelled the bad elements because
    they had to. There was no other way to continue to exist. It is my belief that
    to move forward effectively, the exchanges will have to acknowledge that their
    journey of self-improvement is far from over.

  zh: '-   加密货币交易所的未来可能很大程度上取决于行业对自律的渴望。如我一开始所提到的，交易所通常被认为是“食物链顶端”。它们控制着交易的流动，并在代币经济中扮演着关键角色。交易所不应该在初级市场或次级市场支持内幕交易。由于它们的影响，交易所引入的任何政策或规则都可能对整个市场产生深远影响。加密货币的早期阶段，许多交易所存在“灰色地带”。许多投资者通过不道德的商业实践赚得盆满钵满。然而，加密货币交易所排除了这些不良因素，因为它们必须这样做。没有其他方式可以继续存在。我相信，为了有效地向前迈进，交易所将不得不承认它们的自我改进之路还远未结束。'
- en: Due to increasing competition among exchanges, many seem tempted to shirk self-discipline
    and self-regulation. Accordingly, even in crypto-friendly countries, government
    regulation is becoming more intense. In January of 2018, the South Korea Blockchain
    Association attempted to thwart further regulation by launching a self-regulatory
    program. The Japanese Blockchain Association is working on something similar.
    It remains to be seen if these efforts will be enough.

  zh: '-   由于交易所之间的竞争日益激烈，许多人似乎有诱惑去逃避自律和自我监管。因此，即使在加密货币友好的国家，政府监管也在变得更加严格。2018年1月，韩国区块链协会试图通过启动自律程序来阻止进一步的监管。日本区块链协会正在做类似的事情。这些努力是否足够，还有待观察。'
- en: Across the board, exchanges needs to increase their self-defense capabilities.
    Cryptocurrency is continually growing and evolving, and so must the security that
    protects it. With crypto marching headlong into the mainstream financial market,
    it would be a shame if it tripped and fell because of unaddressed security needs.
    According to CipherTrace, in the first two quarters of 2018, $731 million worth
    of cryptocurrencies were hacked, tripling the total figure for all of 2017\. Phishing
    sites and DDos attacks are continuing to impact the reputations and accountability
    of exchanges of all sizes and types. Clearly, we are not yet doing enough. Addressing
    security capabilities will be absolutely critical for the long-term sustainability
    of the industry.

  zh: '-   全面来看，交易所需要增强自身的防御能力。加密货币不断增长和演变，其保护措施也必须跟上。随着加密货币直线进入主流金融市场，如果因为未解决的安全需求而绊倒和跌倒，那就太遗憾了。根据CipherTrace的数据，2018年第一季度和第二季度，有价值7.31亿美元的加密货币被黑客攻击，比2017年全年总和还要高三倍。钓鱼网站和DDos攻击仍在持续影响各种规模和类型的交易所的声誉和责任。显然，我们做得还远远不够。提高安全能力对行业的长期可持续性将是至关重要的。'
- en: Cryptocurrency is traded between countries and across boundaries of every type.
    But even so, different countries have different regulations regarding these cryptos.
    Governments impose these kind of regulations out of fear, and out of a lack of
    understanding. To avoid a dark future without crypto, it is up to all of us to
    make the case that we are not opposed to any regulation. In fact, it must be shown
    that crypto can be regulated. The best case scenario, of course, is that the industry
    is able to show that it is trustworthy enough to regulate itself.
