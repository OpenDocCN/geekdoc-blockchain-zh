- en: 'IntroductionProgramming is essentially telling a computer what to do, when
    to do it and how to do it. It is giving your computer a series of instructions
    to execute. Programming controls most electronic objects. From computers, to vending
    machines, to cellphones and most importantly, the web.JavaScript has been coined
    the language of the web. This is because most, if not all websites use it to make
    their pages appear more dynamic. It is easy to learn and understand, plus it doesn’t
    cost too much to update and upgrade. A lot of the software that’s used is open
    source. There are also lots of websites with free activities you can use to practice.It
    is a programming language that is rooted in text and it allows web pages to be
    interactive. It provides attractive elements that bring users to web pages. Common
    examples of JavaScript you use everyday are Amazon searchboxes, New York Times
    embedded videos or Twitter feed updates. Making use of JavaScript improves the
    user experience of a website by converting static pages to interactive or animated
    pages. So, in short, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.Most of the time, JavaScript
    is used inside web browsers and on web-based apps. Beyond that, it is used on
    servers, in software and on embedded hardware controls. Some examples of interactive
    features on web pages are: zooming in and out on an image, playing audio and video
    on a web page and showing animations.If you are just starting out and your goal
    is to become a software developer, then you must be well versed in JavaScript.
    It is the most established programming language in the world. Once you are able
    to master it, you will be able to develop front and back-end software. JavaScript
    is omnipresent and is pre-installed in every contemporary web browser, so you
    don’t have to go out of your way to study it.There are many structures within
    JavaScript that developers can use when constructing mobile and web apps. JavaScript
    frameworks are bodies of code libraries that offer pre written code for everyday
    programming tasks and features. One such library is JQuery.At first, JavaScript
    was only used in Browsers to build interactive web pages and it was referred to
    as Toy language by developers. That quickly changed when it started receiving
    a lot of support and getting investment from large companies like Google and Facebook.
    These days you can build full scale mobile apps, Real-time networking apps, Command-Line
    tools and Games.Learn JavaScript QuicklyWhen embarking on your coding journey,
    you may have a constant feeling of having a hard time. Your progress can seem
    slow and it’s easy to want to throw in the towel. Here is what I can recommend
    for you to learn expeditiously:'

  zh: 简介编程本质上是告诉计算机什么时候做什么以及如何做。它就是给你的计算机一系列指令来执行。编程控制着大部分电子设备。从电脑，到自动售货机，到手机，最重要的是，网页。JavaScript被称为网页的语言。这是因为大多数，如果不是全部的网站都使用它使其页面更具动态性。它易于学习和理解，更重要的是，更新和升级成本不太高。很多使用的软件都是开源的。也有很多免费的活动网站可以供你练习。它是根植于文本的编程语言，它使网页变得交互。它提供了吸引用户的元素来到网页。你每天使用的JavaScript的常见例子有亚马逊的搜索框，纽约时报的嵌入式视频或Twitter的动态更新。使用JavaScript可以通过将静态页面转换为交互式或动画页面来改善网页用户体验。所以简而言之，JavaScript为网页添加行为。大部分时间，JavaScript在网页浏览器和基于Web的应用程序中使用。除此之外，它还在服务器，软件和嵌入式硬件控制上使用。网页上交互特性的一些例子有：放大和缩小图像，网页上播放音频和视频，显示动画。如果你刚开始，并且你的目标是成为软件开发人员，那么你必须精通JavaScript。它是世界上最成熟的编程语言。一旦你掌握了它，你就能开发前端和后端软件。JavaScript无处不在，且已预装在每一款现代网页浏览器中，因此你不必费心去研究它。JavaScript内有许多结构，可以在构建移动和网页应用程序时供开发人员使用。JavaScript框架是代码库的集合，提供了日常编程任务和功能的预写代码。其中一个此类库就是JQuery。起初，JavaScript只在浏览器中用于构建交互式网页，被开发人员称为玩具语言。但当它开始获得大公司如Google和Facebook的支持和投资时，情况迅速改变。这些天你可以构建全尺寸的移动应用，实时联网应用，命令行工具和游戏。快速学习JavaScript在启程编码之旅时，你可能会感到始终困难。你的进展看起来很慢，很容易想要放弃。这是我可以为你学习快速推荐的内容：

    Do not feel the need to study everything equally. The Pareto principle states
    that in certain situations, 80% of the effects result from 20% of the causes.
    So, if you focus on 20% of the content in this book that will bring about 80%
    of the results you desire, you will be able to learn in record time. Key areas
    to focus on are Functions, Variables, Conditional statements, Objects and Arrays.

    new. But, it would serve you better to devote more of your time to practicing.
    When you learn to ride a bike, you have to actively move your limbs in order to
    move forward. The same thing applies when learning JavaScript, you learn faster
    by writing code on your machine. In addition to this, dedicating your time is
    essential. Setting aside an hour to practice and write code at least five times
    a week will greatly improve your knowledge.Challenge yourself, and build an actual
    project with JavaScript, no matter how small. Doing this will just cement everything
    you’ve learned. You will also be able to identify what you might be struggling
    with and apply extra effort in those areas.

    也是一样，通过在你的电脑上编写代码，你能更快地学会。此外，时间的投入是至关重要的。每周至少抽出一个小时练习并编写代码，会极大地提高你的知识。挑战自己，用 JavaScript
    构建一个实际的项目，不管多小。这样做将巩固你学到的一切。你还能够发现你可能在哪些地方挣扎，并在这些领域付出额外的努力。

    solve those problems will always be useful. It will make you sharp as a programmer
    and allow you to finish projects faster.What Is JQuery ?Many years ago, when programmers
    wanted to change the look and feel of the attributes on their web pages, they
    had to include lots of font tags and color attributes. This made their HTML pages
    become overloaded with code and it was very hard to maintain. This meant that
    all web pages had to be maintained and modified manually. After the invention
    of CSS they were able to change the appearance of websites without having to write
    endless lines of code for each page. When JavaScript came along, programmers began
    writing the JavaScript code into their HTML documents because they weren’t well
    versed on it at the time. Eventually, they applied the CSS theory to JavaScript
    and JavaScript libraries were born. Among all the libraries in existence at the
    time, JQuery stood out and we still use it today.When you google JQuery, all that
    comes up is that it is a JavaScript library, but there is more to it than that.
    It simplifies the scripting of HTML on the client-side. Its main objective is
    to make using JavaScript easier for you. It can also be used to make adding animation
    easier. It basically takes a whole lot of common tasks that need several lines
    of JavaScript to run and attaches them to form a single line of code.What do client-side
    mean and server-side mean?Client-side and server-side are also referred to as
    front end and back end even though they aren’t entirely the same thing. Client
    side is where the application code runs and server-side is where the source code
    is stored.Some of the most well known features of JQuery are:●     HTML manipulation●     DOM
    manipulation●     CSS manipulation●     Effects and Animation●     Ajax●     UtilitiesJQuery
    became popular because there was a demand in the market for a tool to simplify
    the coding experience. JQuery is faster than its counterparts and is constantly
    being extended. It aids in writing User Interface function codes in as few lines
    as possible. It is compatible with all browsers and is up to date with their latest
    features.

  zh: 学习JavaScript时，你会遇到很多bug。掌握解决这些问题的技能总是很有用的。这将使你成为一名敏捷的程序员，并能让你更快地完成项目。什么是JQuery？许多年前，当程序员想要改变他们网页上的属性的外观和感觉时，他们必须包含大量的字体标签和颜色属性。这让他们的HTML页面充斥着代码，很难维护。这意味着所有的网页都必须手动维护和修改。在CSS的发明之后，他们能够在不为每个页面编写无尽的代码的情况下改变网站的外观。当JavaScript出现时，程序员开始将JavaScript代码写入他们的HTML文档，因为当时他们对此并不很精通。最终，他们将CSS理论应用到JavaScript中，JavaScript库应运而生。在当时存在的所有库中，JQuery脱颖而出，而我们今天还在使用它。当你谷歌JQuery时，所有出现的都是它是一个JavaScript库，但它不仅仅是如此。它简化了客户端HTML的脚本编写。它的主要目标是使JavaScript在你手中更容易。它还可以用于使添加动画变得更容易。它基本上是将需要运行几行JavaScript的常见任务合并到一行代码中。客户端和服务器端代表什么？客户端和服务器端也被称为前端和后端，尽管它们并不完全相同。客户端是应用程序代码运行的地方，服务器端是存储源代码的地方。JQuery最著名的一些特性是：●     HTML操作●     DOM操作●     CSS操作●     特效和动画●     Ajax●     工具JQuery之所以变得流行是因为市场上对简化编码体验的需求。JQuery比其竞争对手更快，并且不断地得到扩展。它帮助用尽可能少的代码编写用户界面功能代码。它与所有浏览器兼容，并且符合它们的最新特性。
