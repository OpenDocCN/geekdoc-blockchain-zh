    and the nearest town is a meandering five-kilometer walking path through mountains,
    rice paddies, and bamboo forest. Over the past thousand years, everything arrived
    to Shangdiping via this path, hauled by villagers on wooden yokes. Whether it
    was getting your rice dehusked or going to town for a relative’s wedding, you
    traveled this single mountain path. One rainy winter day, I walk along this ancient
    trail guided by a hand-drawn paper map, after hearing about Shangdiping from a
    friend who makes a yearly pilgrimage to this village.

    from his mouth, holds a shovel over the pig. He vigorously scrapes the pig to
    get the burnt hairs off, the motion jiggling the pig’s legs back and forth. The

    by subsistence farming. The rural village collective allocated each household
    enough land to plant, to feed themselves. Depending on weather and luck, the yearly
    harvest would yield enough food for a year, maybe a little extra if they were
    lucky. Taking care of the land was an incentive in itself, since it determined

    the gamble the family took on farming every year. And slowly too, younger generations

    there,” he says. “If you earn RMB 3,000 or 4,000 a month, that’s great money,
    sure, but city residents spend more than that just on rent. You can’t build a
    life off that.” Sometimes we play the game or the game plays us. And so Xiao Niu
    took the money he’d earned and returned home to the mountains of Guizhou, determined

    assets is one method, but with farms, depending on the season when you take the
    measurements, assets will change before and after harvest season. Another method
    is quantifying household disposable income—the ability to purchase. It’s these
    on-the-ground variations, compounded into larger macro-economic figures, that
    lead to claims that global poverty is getting much better, or much worse. Yet

    makes a range of platforms, including 1688.com (the digits when said out loud
    in Chinese sound like “Alibaba”), a domestic site for bulk purchases. But Alibaba
    is most well-known for Taobao.com, a huge e-commerce site that allows small businesses
    and individuals to sell directly to consumers. All the goods are new, and some
    of them are homemade. As of 2017, Taobao had six hundred million monthly active
    users, compared to Amazon’s three hundred million monthly active users. Everything,
    and I mean everything, can be found on Taobao: a gold-plated lighter in the shape
    of people in coitus that moans when you ignite it, umbrellas in an array of animal
    shapes and decorations, red dates the size of eggs, tea, fried-dough fritters,
    banned books, banned video games, and Adidas Yeezy shoes that range from obviously
    fake to high-quality fake (“AAA level” in knockoff lingo) to very much real.'

  zh: 在农村淘宝的土地上，没有政府，只有淘宝的规则。阿里巴巴推出了一系列平台，其中包括1688.com（这些数字在中文中念起来像“阿里巴巴”），这是一个国内的批量采购网站。但阿里巴巴最知名的是淘宝网，这是一个巨大的电子商务网站，允许小型企业和个人直接向消费者销售商品。所有商品都是新的，其中一些是自制的。截至2017年，淘宝月活跃用户达到六亿，而亚马逊的月活跃用户数为三亿。在淘宝上什么都能找到：一个形状像人类交媾的镀金打火机，点燃时发出呻吟声，各种动物形状和装饰的雨伞，鸡蛋大小的红枣，茶叶，油炸面团，被禁书籍，被禁电子游戏，以及从明显假货到高质量假货（仿冒者行话中的“AAA级”）到非常真实的阿迪达斯Yeezy鞋子。

    in a thicket of video effects that look like they came from a Microsoft PowerPoint
    presentation circa 1990\. The narrator describes how in 2013 the internet giant
    Alibaba launched the Rural Taobao strategy, aimed at improving the lives of those
    in rural China. It’s as if Google decided to turn itself into a branch of the
    United Nations, or as if Amazon decided it suddenly wanted to offer assistance
    to an Appalachian coal-mining town by helping its citizens start candy businesses
    and giving them Amazon-backed loans.

  zh: 我们正在观看一个视频，讲述农村淘宝如何成为未来。视频中闪烁、旋转、嗡鸣，仿佛来自1990年左右的微软PowerPoint演示文稿的一丛视频效果。叙述者描述了2013年互联网巨头阿里巴巴推出了农村淘宝战略，旨在改善中国农村居民的生活。就像谷歌决定自己成为联合国的分支机构，或者亚马逊突然决定要向阿巴拉契亚的煤矿镇提供帮助，帮助居民开办糖果企业并给予他们亚马逊支持的贷款。
- en: 'The strategy is two-pronged: Rural Taobao and Taobao villages. The first involves
    a series of Rural Taobao Service Centers, which are usually located at the village
    convenience stores and revolve around one URL: cun.taobao.com. At these Rural
    Taobao Service Centers, Taobao contracts with one or two local villagers as brand
    ambassadors. These brand ambassadors are not directly employed by Alibaba but
    are paid a small amount to help villagers buy and select items, as well as access
    other services from the e-commerce platform, such as buying train tickets online
    and scheduling doctor’s appointments. Shopping is the main highlight of rural
    Taobao, but digital literacy is also emphasized. In the rural Taobao world, “digital”
    means anything Alibaba-related. Villagers may not be buying gold lighters anytime
    soon, but practical goods like laundry detergent and long underwear are popular
    with rural users on the site. Other companies have followed suit with this rural
    user acquisition strategy: companies from JD.com to Pinduoduo (an e-commerce app
    that had a US$1.6 billion IPO on NASDAQ) have flooded rural users with an assortment
    of marketplaces that sell various knockoff, *shanzhai* brands that cater to the
    rural income bracket. Scrolling through Pinduoduo, one finds a bizarro land of
    gonzo-capitalism, with PUMPERS diapers, SHAP TVs, and New Bunren sneakers.'

  zh: 这一战略是双管齐下的：农村淘宝和淘宝村。前者涉及一系列的农村淘宝服务中心，通常位于村庄便利店周围，以一个URL为中心：cun.taobao.com。在这些农村淘宝服务中心，淘宝与当地的一两名村民签订合同，担任品牌大使。这些品牌大使并非直接受雇于阿里巴巴，而是获得少量报酬来帮助村民购买和选择商品，以及从电子商务平台上获取其他服务，如购买火车票和预约看医生。购物是农村淘宝的主要亮点，但也强调了数字素养。在农村淘宝的世界中，“数字”意味着一切与阿里巴巴有关的事物。村民们可能不会很快购买金打火机，但洗衣粉和秋裤等实用商品在该网站上深受农村用户的青睐。其他公司也效仿了这一农村用户获取策略：从京东到拼多多（一款在纳斯达克上市的电子商务应用，拥有16亿美元的首次公开募股）的公司纷纷涌入农村用户市场，销售各种迎合农村收入层次的山寨品牌产品。在拼多多上滑动，你会发现一个狂野资本主义的怪诞世界，有PUMPERS纸尿裤、SHAP电视、New
    Bunren运动鞋。

    Taobao Strategy: rural economic growth. It involves planting the seeds for a Taobao
    village. A Taobao village is a place where more than 10 percent of the village
    households are manufacturing at home for Taobao.com. To accomplish this, Alibaba
    has a whole branch of its company focused on rural development, rural finance,
    and rural Taobao. It also has its own rural research institute, AliResearch, which

    Since then, the number of Taobao villages has soared from 1,311 in 2016 to 3,202
    across twenty-four provinces in China in 2018\. When I talked to one researcher
    at AliResearch, he was hopeful that the number would grow. After all, it’s a win-win
    model for Alibaba and economists in the central government. It repopulates the
    countryside and addresses the “hollowed-out village” phenomenon. Young people
    who leave places like Dinglou village find themselves coming back home instead
    of staying in cities. One official document from Dinglou boasts that five hundred
    college students have returned home because of the thriving e-commerce, which
    is a population boom for a village. It brings talent and knowledge back to the
    countryside, and ensures that the countryside will also develop, instead of growth
    concentrating in cities.

    I’m reminded of similar exhibition halls that I’ve seen in Inner Mongolia that
    herald the joys of rare earth mining and cashmere production. Rural areas have
    been sites of extraction, conveniently located out of sight for urbanites. Yet
    in an age when we are shifting to a “digital economy,” when much of our lives

- en: Rising rents in cities have also pushed factory manufacturing costs up in China,
    making goods less competitively priced. In the countryside, where rural residents
    are entitled to land by their *hukou*, where rent and labor costs are low, the
    geography of Taobao villages becomes a competitive advantage. This “spatial fix”
    is something other companies, like Foxconn, are also turning to in a more centralized
    way, setting up a factory in rural Henan instead of in expensive, urban Shenzhen.
    It’s no wonder the Rural Revitalization document of the Chinese Communist Party
    is exuberantly betting on e-commerce. The internet promised disembodiment, but
    the internet has never been more material. The notion of discrete physical and
    digital worlds is nothing but a convenient fiction.

    a rubbery substance, a blast of hot air in the already steaming summer heat. In
    one family workshop, a wife comes downstairs from the family’s living space to
    the manufacturing area—the epitome of a startup garage. She outlines patterns
    onto a thick slab, hundreds of sheets of fabric stacked on top of each other.
    After she’s done drawing the pattern, she hops up on the table in her kitten-heel
    shoes and red skirt, without protective eyewear or earplugs. Her husband pulls
    out a jigsaw, clamps the sheets of fabric to the table, and hands the jigsaw to
    his wife. She starts cutting through the fabric slab. Her hand is steady as she
    pushes the jigsaw along the pattern lines. Next to the table is her mother-in-law,
    who watches, helping affix labels onto packages. After the woman is finished,
    a couple hundred precut pieces are ready to be sewn and dyed into stage-play army

    marked by small stones, tucked in between plots of vegetables and wheat. While
    sustainable agriculture was practiced in China for thousands of years, the urbanization
    and industrialization of the 1980s pressured villagers to require more from their
