    negotiated prices and contract conditions. Value chains (which chart the stages
    though which customer value is created, from R&D through manufacturing and marketing)
    are dispersed across multiple countries; materials, components, and subsystems
    need to be available in sequence to complete the finished product. Such a value
    chain benefits from participation of and cooperation from value-creating enterprises,

    collect from their customers at the end of the period of credit extension, or
    factor such receivables, collecting a discounted amount of their face value immediately
    to increase their liquidity. Similarly, buyers may need to obtain financing to
    offer acceptable payment terms to the seller, and access to such financing may

    applications have launched and progressed to reach operational scale. Blockchain
    usage can satisfy many pressing supply chain needs, ultimately enhancing performance.
    For example, deploying blockchain can provide supply chains with timely accurate
    information, secure and free from tampering, and aid in detecting fraud and counterfeiting.
    Immutability and cryptographically assured security can save costs by reducing
    the involvement of intermediaries. Smart contracts triggered by data entering
    the blockchain, including from IoT devices, can automate transactions, including
    speeding up shipment flow and expediting payment. In addition, trusted data from
    the blockchain can verify provenance and bolster quality assurance, and the data
    accumulated within the blockchain can become the basis for analytical insights

    volume of documentation that accompanies the goods being shipped. These documents
    verify ownership, stage in transit, regulatory compliance, and change in ownership.
    Complete and accurate documentation is essential to an uninterrupted shipment
    journey to the ultimate destination because correctly filled, verified, and duly
    assigned documentation is necessary for shipment clearance and handoff to subsequent
    stages. Global supply chains function ponderously in large part because they rely
    on paper-based processes for most of their documentation. Conflicting information
    and lost documents lead to errors and suspend transaction approval. This creates
    a domino effect that results in long lead times, obscured status and location
    of a shipment, and inefficient capital allocation (due to higher investment in
    pipeline inventory).

  zh: 供应链中的这些参与者相互连接时，伴随着货物运输的是一大批重要的文件。这些文件证实了所有权、运输阶段、合规性以及所有权的变更。完整且准确的文件对于货物顺利到达最终目的地至关重要，因为正确填写、核实并正式分配的文件是货物清关和向下一阶段移交的必要条件。全球供应链在很大程度上运作缓慢，是因为它们大多数文件依赖于基于纸张的过程。冲突信息和丢失的文件会导致错误，并暂停交易审批。这会产生连锁反应，导致交货时间延长、货物状态和位置不明确，以及资本配置效率低下（由于对在途库存的投资增加）。
- en: When buyers finance their purchases with LC, proper documentation and verification
    is essential if the seller is to get paid. The issuing bank, acting for the buyer,
    issues an LC that the seller presents on completing a shipment. The bank honoring
    the compliant LC by releasing payment will in turn expect repayment from the buyer
    on the terms agreed. Hence, the issuing bank will not release payment unless it
    (or its representatives) has ascertained that the trade documents (e.g., the bill
    of lading) comply with the LC terms (description of goods, condition, quantity).
    Furthermore, the issuing bank will use its discretion in determining whether the
    LC terms have been met, and if it decides that there is a discrepancy, it must
    get the buyer’s waiver or assent before payment is made. In other words, the issuing
    bank cannot make unilateral decisions.[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en211) Thus, documentation
    is essential, both for the smooth transfer of goods across intermediary points
    in the supply chain and for authorizing payment against proof of compliance with
    the sales contract and LC terms.

  zh: 当买方使用信用证（LC）为其购买融资时，如果卖方想要收到付款，适当的文件和核实是必不可少的。开证行代表买方发出信用证，卖方在完成装运后提交该信用证。银行在履行符合信用证的装运单据后释放付款，然后期待按照协议条款从买方那里获得偿还。因此，开证行只有在核实贸易文件（例如，提单）符合信用证条款（货物描述、条件、数量）后，才会释放付款。此外，开证行将自行决定是否满足了信用证条款，如果它决定存在差异，必须在付款前获得买方的放弃或同意。换句话说，开证行不能单方面做出决定。[2](14085-0014.xhtml#en211)

- en: EDI has been the standard for document transmission in traditional supply chains;
    LCs are often issued as MT700 messages within the SWIFT network. Any changes in

    contract terms or a lack of accurate updated information at both origin and destination.
    Obtaining the necessary modified documents can be a slow process that causes delays
    while raising costs. In many cases, supply chain actors have resorted to developing
    personal connections with expeditors at various locations to obtain such information

    to the sender. HTLCs obviate the need for an intermediary (i.e., the correspondent
    bank) to hold an escrow account to ensure satisfactory transaction completion.

    currency of their choice for XRP; transfer the XRP near instantaneously, securely,
    and at low cost; and then immediately convert the XRP received into local currency
    on the other end of the transaction. This is possible because Ripple persuaded
    cryptocurrency exchanges in multiple countries to list XRP for trading. This allows
    entities who participate in sending or receiving XRP to use the exchanges to purchase
    or sell XRP holdings for national currencies such as the US dollar or the euro.
    The emergence and growth in trading volume in XRP on such cryptocurrency exchanges
    gradually increases XRP liquidity, and ease of exchange with various fiat currencies

    to use RippleNet and xRapid to transfer fiat currencies, for a fee lower than
    the cost of using SWIFT. Banks then manage their own liquidity balances in different

    in global trade.[31](14085-0014.xhtml#en240) Under open account terms, a seller
    ships goods to a buyer, with payment to be made within a certain period, that
    is, thirty, sixty, or ninety days. The seller/shipper bears the risk of nonpayment,
    leading sellers to obtain credit insurance, an additional cost of global trade
    and trade financing. Furthermore, banks are reluctant to finance global trade
    as an unscrupulous firm might attempt to use the same purchase order (a paper
    document) and forge such documents to obtain financing for the same shipment from
    multiple banks. As a result, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are less
    able to obtain trade financing from banks, stunting their growth.

    in meeting ISO standards, sustainability ratings, diversity, and reputation. The
    platform can help a merchant rapidly assess a potential supplier, drawing on their
    reliability record, performance ratings, and answers to FAQs from other users.
    It does this by using third parties such as Dun & Bradstreet to validate supplier
    records, EcoVadis for sustainability profile, and banks and entities such as RapidRatings
    that can verify account information and financial profile and risk. Clients can
    interact with the Trust Your Supplier application with web interfaces (APIs) and
    through procurement platforms such as SAP Ariba, and they can use a personalized
    dashboard to find and then select between qualified suppliers. Sellers who are
    not meeting their commitments, or acting in bad faith, can be denied access to
    the platform, with similar sanctions for buyers. IBM refers to these services
    as providing suppliers with a “blockchain-enabled digital passport.”[39](14085-0014.xhtml#en248)
    Sharing such passport data reduces time to validate and onboard that supplier

  zh: 一个像Trust Your Supplier这样的平台专注于帮助企业找到合格可靠的供应商，它通过不可篡改的供应商认证满足ISO标准，可持续发展评级，多元化和声誉。该平台能帮助商家快速评估潜在供应商，参考其可靠性记录、绩效评级以及对其他用户常见问题的回答。该平台通过使用第三方如邓白氏（Dun
    & Bradstreet）验证供应商记录，EcoVadis进行可持续性分析，以及银行和实体如RapidRatings验证账户信息和财务概况及风险。客户可以通过网络接口（API）与Trust
    Your Supplier应用程序互动，并通过SAP Ariba等采购平台进行操作，他们还可以使用个性化的仪表板来查找并在合格的供应商之间进行选择。不履行承诺或怀有恶意行为的卖家将被禁止访问该平台，买家也会受到类似的处罚。IBM将这些服务称为向供应商提供“基于区块链的数字护照”。[39](14085-0014.xhtml#en248)分享此类护照数据可以减少验证和上车时间。
- en: 'This chapter surveyed blockchain application in three different industry sectors—digital
    currency and payments, DeFi applications using digital currencies, and global
    supply chains and trade finance. These applications share a common element: they
    consist of multiple independent firms that come together to meet customer needs.
    This requires that they share information, trust each other, and collaborate in
    the best interests of the customer while remaining competitive and attempting
    to increase their profitability, forming ecosystems to provide customer solutions.
    Blockchains are uniquely suited to function effectively in ecosystems, and in
    chapter 6, I discuss the ecosystems framework and its strategic implications.
    I then draw on the varied results of several applications and pilots to discuss
    how enterprises can best leverage the ecosystem perspective to launch successful
    blockchain applications.'

  zh: 本章概述了区块链技术在三个不同行业领域的应用：数字货币与支付、使用数字货币的DeFi应用，以及全球供应链和贸易金融。这些应用有一个共同点：它们都由多个独立公司组成，这些公司联合起来以满足客户需求。这要求它们共享信息、彼此信任并协作，在保持竞争力的同时，力求提高盈利能力，形成生态系统以提供客户解决方案。区块链特别适合在生态系统中有效运行，在第六章中，我讨论了生态系统框架及其战略影响。接着，我借鉴了几个应用和试点项目的不同成果，讨论企业如何最佳地利用生态系统视角来成功推出区块链应用。
