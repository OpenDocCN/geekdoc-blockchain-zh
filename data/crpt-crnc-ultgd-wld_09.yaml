- en: There are many people now who are learning about cryptocurrencies and are ready
    to trade. However, as with all types of investments getting too emotionally involved,
    too excited about the venture can lead to trouble. You forget to take the necessary
    precautions, and you usually end up losing out in the end. Newcomers to the digital
    currency trade tend to make the same types of mistakes and end up in situations
    that they could have easily avoided if they had been forewarned. Here are the
    most common mistakes you should try to avoid when you start trading in the cryptocurrency
    market.

  zh: 现在有很多人正在学习关于加密货币的知识并准备进行交易。然而，就像所有类型的投资一样，过于情绪化，对这项事业过于兴奋可能会导致问题。你忘记了采取必要的预防措施，通常最后你会损失惨重。加密货币交易的新手倾向于犯同样的错误，并最终陷入本来可以轻易避免的情况。以下是你开始在加密货币市场交易时应尽量避免的最常见错误。

  zh: 信息不足
- en: No matter what your goals are or what you expect to get out of your investment
    strategy, knowledge can be your best friend, or it can be your worst enemy if
    you don't have it. It pays to do a lot of research before deciding to jump into
    the deep end. As you can see from what we've discussed already, it can be very
    easy to make money with cryptocurrency, but it can be very costly if you make
    a mistake.

  zh: 无论你的目标是什么，或者你期望从你的投资策略中获得什么，知识可以是你的最佳朋友，如果你没有它，它也可以是你的最大敌人。在决定跳入深水之前，做大量的研究是值得的。正如我们之前所讨论的，通过加密货币赚钱可能非常容易，但如果犯错误，代价可能非常高。
- en: Just the fact that once a block is set up on the Blockchain, it cannot be reversed
    or altered should be warning enough that mistakes can be extremely costly. People
    have lost thousands of dollars simply by inputting the wrong information, giving
    their code to the wrong people, or just not doing their homework and investing
    in the wrong type of currency.

  zh: 仅仅因为一旦在区块链上设置了一个区块，它就不能被撤销或更改，这应该足以警告你错误可能造成巨大的成本。人们仅仅因为输入了错误的信息、将他们的代码给了错误的人，或者只是没有做家庭作业并投资了错误的货币而失去了数千美元。
- en: Before you invest, always learn as much as you can about the currency, the protocols,
    the security in place, the fees, and anything else that may affect your return
    on investment. Learn the history of the currency, the exchange, the activity and
    always have a plan in place before you start.

    You should already have in mind under what conditions you plan to sell and the
    terms for when you need to get out of the market to cut your losses. Once you’ve

    your performance and your return on investment.

    price possible from reputable exchange houses. It might even be better to wait
