  zh: 加密货币的误解
- en: I frankly admit that I also almost got infected with scepticism towards cryptocurrency
    at the beginning of my journey, as many people scared me by telling me that cryptocurrency
    is a wildcat venture, financial pyramid, or the like. Such false beliefs often
    fence many people off from possible success. Only a small number of sticklers
    verify such statements about cryptocurrency instead of just blindly believing
    them.

  zh: 我坦白承认，在我旅程的开始，我也几乎被对加密货币的怀疑所感染，因为很多人吓唬我说加密货币是一场冒险，是金融金字塔，或诸如此类的东西。这样的错误信念常常使许多人远离可能的成功。只有少数人会去核实关于加密货币的这些说法，而不是盲目地相信它们。
- en: I am sure that you have also heard allegations that no country will ever recognize
    cryptocurrency so cryptocurrency has no future. To refute this, it is enough to
    recall the recent increase in the value of cryptocurrency. Some countries have
    already recognized cryptocurrency as means of payment. Thus, this so-called “entertainment
    for geeks” has evolved into very real business for investment bankers and various
    corporations.

  zh: 我敢肯定你也听说过这样的言论，认为没有国家会承认加密货币，所以加密货币没有未来。为了反驳这一点，只需回忆一下加密货币最近价值的增长。有些国家已经承认加密货币是支付手段。因此，这种所谓的“极客娱乐”已经演变成投资银行家和各种公司的非常真实的业务。
- en: Therefore, if you, personally, still do not earn money in cryptocurrency, it
    is most likely because of the large number of the aforementioned statements, which
    you may have heard from pseudo-experts.

- en: First, right  now there is very little competition in the market. Are you surprised?
    It’s true. Yes, the interest in this topic constantly grows, but in general, the
    competition is still very low. This market is still quite "wild" and unmastered.
    The reason for this is that most people tend not to trust new trends and ventures,
    as we have already mentioned above.

  zh: 首先，现在市场上的竞争非常小。你感到惊讶吗？这是真的。是的，对这个话题的兴趣在不断增长，但总体而言，竞争仍然非常低。这个市场仍然相当“野性”和未被掌握。这是因为正如我们上面所提到的，大多数人往往不信任新趋势和冒险。
- en: Second, right now you can reap high returns on this market. Cryptocurrency prices
    are at the stage of growth and development, but even so, you can earn a decent
    sum of money. As long as you manage your risks wisely, you can make profits in

  zh: 第二，现在你可以在市场上获得高回报。加密货币正处于增长和发展的阶段，尽管如此，你仍然可以赚取可观的收入。只要你能明智地管理风险，你就能及时获利。
- en: Third, right now there are a lot of freeloaders in the market. They come to
    the cryptocurrency market to make a quick buck without delving into the subject.
    Usually, such people come from the pyramid schemes led by so-called "experts"
    who teach people without having any real experience in the topic themselves. I
    must admit that the market encouraged such people in the beginning, when they
    had a chance to make lots of money then. However, nowadays, if you want to achieve
    something like this in the cryptocurrency market, you will have to make real efforts.

  zh: 第三，现在市场上有很多免费搭乘的人。他们来到加密货币市场，想不劳而获地快速赚钱，而不深入了解这个领域。通常，这样的人来自由所谓“专家”领导的金字塔式骗局，而这些“专家”自己在该领域没有任何实际经验。我必须承认，市场在最开始时鼓励了这样的人，当时他们有机会赚很多钱。然而，现在，如果你想在加密货币市场上实现类似的目标，你必须付出真正的努力。
- en: Fourth, right now there are low risks in the market. Five years ago, most people
    waited for the day when cryptocurrency would be officially banned. These days,
    many countries around the world have already recognized the relevance of cryptocurrency.
    Cryptocurrency has gained such momentum that no one can simply press the stop
    button now. Do you really think that this fact does not prove you can invest your
    money without fear of various prohibitions and restrictions?

  zh: 第四，现在市场的风险较低。五年前，大多数人都在等待加密货币被正式禁止的那一天。如今，世界上许多国家已经承认加密货币的相关性。加密货币已经获得了如此巨大的动力，以至于现在没有人可以简单地按下停止按钮。你真的认为这个事实不证明你可以毫无恐惧地投资你的钱，不怕各种禁令和限制吗？
- en: Finally, before moving on to the rules of the game in the cryptocurrency market,
    I suggest considering the future of cryptocurrency through the example of the
    Tesla company. Currently, the cost of a Tesla is estimated in the amount that,
    according to the expert forecasts, it will not be able to make back its expense
    in 300 years. Why do smart experts rate Teslas so highly then? Let's puzzle it
    out.

  zh: 最后，在深入了解加密货币市场的规则之前，我建议通过特斯拉公司的例子来思考加密货币的未来。目前，特斯拉的成本估计是如此之高，以至于根据专家预测，它需要300年才能回收成本。那么，这些聪明的专家为什么会如此高度评价特斯拉呢？让我们一起来解决这个问题。
- en: These days, an electric car is beautiful and stylish but expensive and not a
    very practical vehicle. However, experts are not concerned about today. They visualize
    a future that can become a reality in 20 or 30 years. It is difficult to imagine
    in years to come the ordinary cars we see daily in the streets now. You may imagine
    your old beloved car in the future, but personally, I picture some kind of semi-flying
    vehicles with solar panels or something even more sophisticated. Therefore, it
    is the electric vehicle that will have a bright and successful future, and Tesla
    is likely to occupy a leading position in the market.

  zh: 如今，电动汽车既美观又时尚，但昂贵且不太实用。然而，专家们并不关心当下。他们设想的是一个可以在20或30年内成为现实的未来。很难想象在未来几年里，我们每天在街上看到的普通汽车会变成什么样子。你可能想象得到你过去心爱的汽车在未来会是什么样子，但就我个人而言，我设想的是某种带有太阳能电池板或更为复杂装置的半飞行车辆。因此，是电动汽车将拥有光明和成功的未来，而特斯拉很可能会在市场上占据领先地位。
- en: It turns out that, by and large, no one knows for certain whether Tesla will
    hold its position in the market for the next 20-30 years. However, many people
    strongly believe it will, and this belief makes them invest in the company. Therefore,
    personally, I can easily believe that Tesla will hold a monopoly in the entire
    automotive manufacturing sector in 20 years.

  zh: 结果证明，在很大程度上，没有人确切地知道特斯拉是否能在未来20-30年内保持其在市场上的地位。然而，许多人坚信它能做到，这种信念促使他们投资于这家公司。因此，我个人很容易相信，特斯拉将在20年内垄断整个汽车制造业。
- en: How is this example linked to the future of cryptocurrency? Nowadays, some people
    view cryptocurrency (like an electric vehicle) as meaningless – a fashionable,
    interesting and technically curious trend. But a trend, nonetheless. However,
    this tiny drop now is likely to grow into a large dominant sea in the future.
