    restore a centrifugal Internet. They were proposing the breakdown of the system
    into just two key structures: monolith, the predictable carriers of the blockchain
    underneath, and metaverse, the inventive and surprising operations of its users
    above. They would provide the foundation for a creative cornucopia.'

  zh: Muneeb Ali、Ryan Shea及其团队准备反击Google模式，恢复离心型互联网。他们提议将系统分解为仅有的两个关键结构：单体，区块链下面可预见的载体，以及元宇宙，其用户在上面进行创新和惊喜的操作。他们将为创意丰富多彩的基础奠定基础。
- en: Continuing to work on his “New Internet” Ph.D. thesis but running out of funds
    again, Muneeb Ali was more interested in actually building the new network. In
    2012, he had the good fortune to meet Jude Nelson, a tall, blond-haired software
    engineer from Arizona who needed help in Manhattan on a storage project named
    Syndicate, an enterprise file-storage system based on blockchains. Using cryptographic
    mathematics—hashes across time—it provides safe pointers to computer storage locations
    and addresses. Syndicate could use storage facilities like Google Drive, Amazon’s
    S3, and Microsoft Azure as utilities by storing pointers and ID in the blockchain,
    with the data’s owners retaining control.

  zh: 在继续他的“新互联网”博士论文工作但再次资金短缺时，Muneeb Ali 更加感兴趣的是实际建设新网络。2012年，他有幸遇到了Jude Nelson，一个来自亚利桑那州的高个子金发软件工程师，他在曼哈顿的一个名为Syndicate的存储项目上需要帮助，这是一个基于区块链的企业文件存储系统。使用加密数学——通过时间的哈希——它提供安全的计算机存储位置和地址的指针。Syndicate可以利用像Google
    Drive、Amazon的S3和Microsoft Azure这样的存储设施作为实用工具，通过在区块链中存储指针和ID，数据的所有者保留控制权。
- en: Nelson and Ali felt a surge of excitement about blockchain technology. Ali described
    it as “the most sophisticated and complex and yet elegant and beautiful program
    I ever came across. And the main thing it does is it gives power back to the people.”
    He joined Nelson working on Syndicate, and two years later Nelson came to work
    for him in Manhattan at Blockstack, then called “OneName,” which Ali and Shea,
    on leave from Princeton, had started in 2013.

    says Shea. “You go onto the net and Facebook or Google or Dropbox or Pinterest
    or Amazon and all want you to move in, giving them all your documents, music,

    foundations. Ali explains: “Decentralized identity systems enable users to control
    a unique identity recorded on the blockchain that can be recognized by any site.”[¹](notes.html#ch15note-1)
    He contrasts this universal ID with the current “username and password combo that
    can only be recognized by the site that had you create an account.” With the blockchain,
    users can log in to the websites by automatically proving ownership of their identity.'

- en: When Ali and Shea were getting started on their project, thousands of new Internet
    companies were forming around bitcoin and the blockchain. But most of them were
    supplying new services (Abra’s blockchain-based remittances to Third World countries),

    a new secure protocol layer for the Internet by which the identification, money,
    power, and property could stay with their owner rather than be sucked up to the

    View, California, for a stint and demo. Started by the entrepreneur Paul Graham,
    YC was a kind of reverse Hotel California for nerds—hard to get into and easy
    to leave. Thiel told the Y-Combinator in 2015 to seek “apparently bad ideas” that
    “were actually good,” like Dropbox (cloud-based storage) and Airbnb (cloud-based

- en: While Blockstack minimizes the use of blockchain for storage and complex computation,
    Ethereum burdens its chain with both storage and software loops and recursions.
    Thus it may become less efficient and less scalable and more complex and vulnerable.
    While Blockstack focuses on the infrastructural foundation of the network—naming,
    identity, and pointers to storage—Ethereum has become “a token factory,” in Nelson’s
    phrase. It provides a broad computational Turing machine for smart contracts and
    tokens that exposes a large attack surface to external hacks and internal bugs.

    Translating natural language names and site titles into Internet address numbers,
    a DNS participates in your every move on the Net. A DNS constitutes a Trusted
    Third Party such as Verisign or GoDaddy or, increasingly, Google’s own free public

- en: Moving the DNS to the blockchain, Blockstack eliminates an important point of
    vulnerability on the Internet. Names are time-stamped, immutably stored, and distributed
    to all the nodes on the Net through the blockchain ledger. At first, Blockstack
    chose to use the Namecoin blockchain, one of the first bitcoin rivals, optimized
    for storing immutable names. But by 2016, Ali and Shea noticed that Namecoin was
    increasingly vulnerable to attack by an increasingly concentrated group of miners.
    Scrutinizing data on all the available blockchains, including Ethereum, they discovered
    that by far the most robust, secure, and reliable blockchain was Satoshi’s bitcoin
    blockchain. Blockstack now faced a critical test, having to move some eighty thousand
    subscribers from one blockchain to another. Fortunately, the team had already

    Ethereum sort of does this with ERC20, but it doesn’t work at scale. Plus, each
    ERC20 application is tied to the fate of Ethereum, which may make them less likely
