- en: 'CHAPTER 6Tokenized AssetsAs communication and payments become ideal, frictionless
    transactions could change how people trade various assets. A popular blockchain
    can anchor transactions of assets other than money. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the
    current best candidates for such blockchains and would become a new and virtual
    jurisdiction. First, we will distinguish blockchain tokens from cryptocurrencies
    and other assets, and will view blockchain networks as platforms for the future
    of finance. After that, we look at the types of tokens that can live on these
    networks and what opportunities arise from them.Creating a digital token representing
    a specific asset has an advantage: it expands the market for that asset, giving
    it greater liquidity. The owners of the tokenized asset can buy or sell it much
    faster than an ordinary investment. That by itself makes the asset more valuable.
    The token can represent a financial agreement, such as a debt, a physical property,
    gold or real estate. Porting the administration of such traditional assets over
    to a blockchain can make trade more efficient. However, the best chance of sparking
    opportunities comes from new types of assets, which cannot exist or be traded
    without digital tokens defined by a smart contract on a blockchain. For example,
    game-based digital items can interact and combine to make new and unique items,
    such as minting new digital trading cards or breeding creatures with individual
    digital genomes, which creators and owners can trade in a global marketplace.Difference
    Between Currency and TokensAs explained previously, the Ethereum network lets
    developers deploy smart contracts that define ETH flows on its blockchain or enable
    tokens. Many teams have launched these tokens to fund projects and to bootstrap
    a circular economy. To understand how these tokens work, we must first distinguish
    this type of crypto-asset from cryptocurrency. We call them “coins,” but that
    seems an attempt to link them with the success of Bitcoin. The word coin refers
    to a currency that circulates widely. Traditional, physical coins do not represent
    anything else. They have a value of their own because they are scarce and valuable,
    either because of:•    the precious metal they are made of;•    the issuing central
    bank’s precious metal;•    the fiat rights of the central bank.Cryptocurrencies
    mimic the qualities of coins and paper cash. In contrast, tokens are not like
    cash but resemble laundromat or train ride tokens, or casino chips. They are portable
    objects that have value in a specific context. A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically
    secured digital asset that entitles the holder to something. Usually, it is a
    promise or guarantee made by the issuer. A token’s value may be set by the issuer,
    as with casino chips, or imposed by the market, like physical commodities or collectible
    items. Even if the market determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s
    technology, such as a website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you
    are holding a digital cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can
    only see or breed by connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That
    means the ownership is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A
    cryptocurrency has value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce
    and circulate widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the
    currency units on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties
    can catalyze a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts
    of people use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves
    are scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Tokenized AssetsAs communication and payments
    become ideal, frictionless transactions could change how people trade various
    assets. A popular blockchain can anchor transactions of assets other than money.
    Bitcoin and Ethereum are the current best candidates for such blockchains and
    would become a new and virtual jurisdiction. First, we will distinguish blockchain
    tokens from cryptocurrencies and other assets, and will view blockchain networks
    as platforms for the future of finance. After that, we look at the types of tokens
    that can live on these networks and what opportunities arise from them.Creating
    a digital token representing a specific asset has an advantage: it expands the
    market for that asset, giving it greater liquidity. The owners of the tokenized
    asset can buy or sell it much faster than an ordinary investment. That by itself
    makes the asset more valuable. The token can represent a financial agreement,
    such as a debt, a physical property, gold or real estate. Porting the administration
    of such traditional assets over to a blockchain can make trade more efficient.
    However, the best chance of sparking opportunities comes from new types of assets,
    which cannot exist or be traded without digital tokens defined by a smart contract
    on a blockchain. For example, game-based digital items can interact and combine
    to make new and unique items, such as minting new digital trading cards or breeding
    creatures with individual digital genomes, which creators and owners can trade
    in a global marketplace.Difference Between Currency and TokensAs explained previously,
    the Ethereum network lets developers deploy smart contracts that define ETH flows
    on its blockchain or enable tokens. Many teams have launched these tokens to fund
    projects and to bootstrap a circular economy. To understand how these tokens work,
    we must first distinguish this type of crypto-asset from cryptocurrency. We call
    them “coins,” but that seems an attempt to link them with the success of Bitcoin.
    The word coin refers to a currency that circulates widely. Traditional, physical
    coins do not represent anything else. They have a value of their own because they
    are scarce and valuable, either because of:•    the precious metal they are made
    of;•    the issuing central bank’s precious metal;•    the fiat rights of the
    central bank.Cryptocurrencies mimic the qualities of coins and paper cash. In
    contrast, tokens are not like cash but resemble laundromat or train ride tokens,
    or casino chips. They are portable objects that have value in a specific context.
    A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically secured digital asset that entitles
    the holder to something. Usually, it is a promise or guarantee made by the issuer.
    A token’s value may be set by the issuer, as with casino chips, or imposed by
    the market, like physical commodities or collectible items. Even if the market
    determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s technology, such as a
    website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you are holding a digital
    cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can only see or breed by
    connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That means the ownership
    is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A cryptocurrency has
    value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce and circulate
    widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the currency units
    on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties can catalyze
    a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts of people
    use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves are
    scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!As communication and payments become ideal,
    frictionless transactions could change how people trade various assets. A popular
    blockchain can anchor transactions of assets other than money. Bitcoin and Ethereum
    are the current best candidates for such blockchains and would become a new and
    virtual jurisdiction. First, we will distinguish blockchain tokens from cryptocurrencies
    and other assets, and will view blockchain networks as platforms for the future
    of finance. After that, we look at the types of tokens that can live on these
    networks and what opportunities arise from them.Creating a digital token representing
    a specific asset has an advantage: it expands the market for that asset, giving
    it greater liquidity. The owners of the tokenized asset can buy or sell it much
    faster than an ordinary investment. That by itself makes the asset more valuable.
    The token can represent a financial agreement, such as a debt, a physical property,
    gold or real estate. Porting the administration of such traditional assets over
    to a blockchain can make trade more efficient. However, the best chance of sparking
    opportunities comes from new types of assets, which cannot exist or be traded
    without digital tokens defined by a smart contract on a blockchain. For example,
    game-based digital items can interact and combine to make new and unique items,
    such as minting new digital trading cards or breeding creatures with individual
    digital genomes, which creators and owners can trade in a global marketplace.Difference
    Between Currency and TokensAs explained previously, the Ethereum network lets
    developers deploy smart contracts that define ETH flows on its blockchain or enable
    tokens. Many teams have launched these tokens to fund projects and to bootstrap
    a circular economy. To understand how these tokens work, we must first distinguish
    this type of crypto-asset from cryptocurrency. We call them “coins,” but that
    seems an attempt to link them with the success of Bitcoin. The word coin refers
    to a currency that circulates widely. Traditional, physical coins do not represent
    anything else. They have a value of their own because they are scarce and valuable,
    either because of:•    the precious metal they are made of;•    the issuing central
    bank’s precious metal;•    the fiat rights of the central bank.Cryptocurrencies
    mimic the qualities of coins and paper cash. In contrast, tokens are not like
    cash but resemble laundromat or train ride tokens, or casino chips. They are portable
    objects that have value in a specific context. A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically
    secured digital asset that entitles the holder to something. Usually, it is a
    promise or guarantee made by the issuer. A token’s value may be set by the issuer,
    as with casino chips, or imposed by the market, like physical commodities or collectible
    items. Even if the market determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s
    technology, such as a website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you
    are holding a digital cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can
    only see or breed by connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That
    means the ownership is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A
    cryptocurrency has value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce
    and circulate widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the
    currency units on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties
    can catalyze a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts
    of people use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves
    are scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Creating a digital token representing
    a specific asset has an advantage: it expands the market for that asset, giving
    it greater liquidity. The owners of the tokenized asset can buy or sell it much
    faster than an ordinary investment. That by itself makes the asset more valuable.
    The token can represent a financial agreement, such as a debt, a physical property,
    gold or real estate. Porting the administration of such traditional assets over
    to a blockchain can make trade more efficient. However, the best chance of sparking
    opportunities comes from new types of assets, which cannot exist or be traded
    without digital tokens defined by a smart contract on a blockchain. For example,
    game-based digital items can interact and combine to make new and unique items,
    such as minting new digital trading cards or breeding creatures with individual
    digital genomes, which creators and owners can trade in a global marketplace.Difference
    Between Currency and TokensAs explained previously, the Ethereum network lets
    developers deploy smart contracts that define ETH flows on its blockchain or enable
    tokens. Many teams have launched these tokens to fund projects and to bootstrap
    a circular economy. To understand how these tokens work, we must first distinguish
    this type of crypto-asset from cryptocurrency. We call them “coins,” but that
    seems an attempt to link them with the success of Bitcoin. The word coin refers
    to a currency that circulates widely. Traditional, physical coins do not represent
    anything else. They have a value of their own because they are scarce and valuable,
    either because of:•    the precious metal they are made of;•    the issuing central
    bank’s precious metal;•    the fiat rights of the central bank.Cryptocurrencies
    mimic the qualities of coins and paper cash. In contrast, tokens are not like
    cash but resemble laundromat or train ride tokens, or casino chips. They are portable
    objects that have value in a specific context. A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically
    secured digital asset that entitles the holder to something. Usually, it is a
    promise or guarantee made by the issuer. A token’s value may be set by the issuer,
    as with casino chips, or imposed by the market, like physical commodities or collectible
    items. Even if the market determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s
    technology, such as a website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you
    are holding a digital cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can
    only see or breed by connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That
    means the ownership is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A
    cryptocurrency has value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce
    and circulate widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the
    currency units on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties
    can catalyze a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts
    of people use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves
    are scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Difference Between Currency and TokensAs
    explained previously, the Ethereum network lets developers deploy smart contracts
    that define ETH flows on its blockchain or enable tokens. Many teams have launched
    these tokens to fund projects and to bootstrap a circular economy. To understand
    how these tokens work, we must first distinguish this type of crypto-asset from
    cryptocurrency. We call them “coins,” but that seems an attempt to link them with
    the success of Bitcoin. The word coin refers to a currency that circulates widely.
    Traditional, physical coins do not represent anything else. They have a value
    of their own because they are scarce and valuable, either because of:•    the
    precious metal they are made of;•    the issuing central bank’s precious metal;•    the
    fiat rights of the central bank.Cryptocurrencies mimic the qualities of coins
    and paper cash. In contrast, tokens are not like cash but resemble laundromat
    or train ride tokens, or casino chips. They are portable objects that have value
    in a specific context. A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically secured
    digital asset that entitles the holder to something. Usually, it is a promise
    or guarantee made by the issuer. A token’s value may be set by the issuer, as
    with casino chips, or imposed by the market, like physical commodities or collectible
    items. Even if the market determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s
    technology, such as a website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you
    are holding a digital cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can
    only see or breed by connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That
    means the ownership is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A
    cryptocurrency has value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce
    and circulate widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the
    currency units on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties
    can catalyze a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts
    of people use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves
    are scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!As explained previously, the Ethereum
    network lets developers deploy smart contracts that define ETH flows on its blockchain
    or enable tokens. Many teams have launched these tokens to fund projects and to
    bootstrap a circular economy. To understand how these tokens work, we must first
    distinguish this type of crypto-asset from cryptocurrency. We call them “coins,”
    but that seems an attempt to link them with the success of Bitcoin. The word coin
    refers to a currency that circulates widely. Traditional, physical coins do not
    represent anything else. They have a value of their own because they are scarce
    and valuable, either because of:•    the precious metal they are made of;•    the
    issuing central bank’s precious metal;•    the fiat rights of the central bank.Cryptocurrencies
    mimic the qualities of coins and paper cash. In contrast, tokens are not like
    cash but resemble laundromat or train ride tokens, or casino chips. They are portable
    objects that have value in a specific context. A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically
    secured digital asset that entitles the holder to something. Usually, it is a
    promise or guarantee made by the issuer. A token’s value may be set by the issuer,
    as with casino chips, or imposed by the market, like physical commodities or collectible
    items. Even if the market determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s
    technology, such as a website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you
    are holding a digital cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can
    only see or breed by connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That
    means the ownership is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A
    cryptocurrency has value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce
    and circulate widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the
    currency units on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties
    can catalyze a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts
    of people use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves
    are scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!•    the precious metal they are made
    of;•    the issuing central bank’s precious metal;•    the fiat rights of the
    central bank.Cryptocurrencies mimic the qualities of coins and paper cash. In
    contrast, tokens are not like cash but resemble laundromat or train ride tokens,
    or casino chips. They are portable objects that have value in a specific context.
    A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically secured digital asset that entitles
    the holder to something. Usually, it is a promise or guarantee made by the issuer.
    A token’s value may be set by the issuer, as with casino chips, or imposed by
    the market, like physical commodities or collectible items. Even if the market
    determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s technology, such as a
    website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you are holding a digital
    cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can only see or breed by
    connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That means the ownership
    is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A cryptocurrency has
    value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce and circulate
    widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the currency units
    on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties can catalyze
    a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts of people
    use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves are
    scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!•    the issuing central bank’s precious
    metal;•    the fiat rights of the central bank.Cryptocurrencies mimic the qualities
    of coins and paper cash. In contrast, tokens are not like cash but resemble laundromat
    or train ride tokens, or casino chips. They are portable objects that have value
    in a specific context. A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically secured
    digital asset that entitles the holder to something. Usually, it is a promise
    or guarantee made by the issuer. A token’s value may be set by the issuer, as
    with casino chips, or imposed by the market, like physical commodities or collectible
    items. Even if the market determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s
    technology, such as a website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you
    are holding a digital cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can
    only see or breed by connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That
    means the ownership is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A
    cryptocurrency has value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce
    and circulate widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the
    currency units on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties
    can catalyze a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts
    of people use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves
    are scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!•    the fiat rights of the central bank.Cryptocurrencies
    mimic the qualities of coins and paper cash. In contrast, tokens are not like
    cash but resemble laundromat or train ride tokens, or casino chips. They are portable
    objects that have value in a specific context. A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically
    secured digital asset that entitles the holder to something. Usually, it is a
    promise or guarantee made by the issuer. A token’s value may be set by the issuer,
    as with casino chips, or imposed by the market, like physical commodities or collectible
    items. Even if the market determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s
    technology, such as a website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you
    are holding a digital cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can
    only see or breed by connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That
    means the ownership is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A
    cryptocurrency has value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce
    and circulate widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the
    currency units on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties
    can catalyze a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts
    of people use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves
    are scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Cryptocurrencies mimic the qualities of
    coins and paper cash. In contrast, tokens are not like cash but resemble laundromat
    or train ride tokens, or casino chips. They are portable objects that have value
    in a specific context. A token on a blockchain is a cryptographically secured
    digital asset that entitles the holder to something. Usually, it is a promise
    or guarantee made by the issuer. A token’s value may be set by the issuer, as
    with casino chips, or imposed by the market, like physical commodities or collectible
    items. Even if the market determines the price, you might still need the issuer’s
    technology, such as a website, to interpret the token. For example, imagine you
    are holding a digital cat token, a CryptoKitty , in your wallet, which you can
    only see or breed by connecting your wallet to the CryptoKitties -website. That
    means the ownership is decentralized, but not necessarily the asset’s utility.A
    cryptocurrency has value because the units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce
    and circulate widely. Both these qualities are united in virtual objects, the
    currency units on the blockchain. As described in previous chapters, these properties
    can catalyze a network effect. The units become a currency as increasing amounts
    of people use it.In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves
    are scarce or even unique, while their value depends on the asset they represent.
    The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but
    to appraise the, we also need to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the
    launch of altcoins and tokenized assets, some have tried to classify these new
    crypto-assets. Investors, speculators, and entrepreneurs need such a classification
    system to understand what they are buying or guide the design and issue of a token.
    In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an
    entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping
    a circular economy.Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for
    ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any
    other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019).
    It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including
    international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative
    financial products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and
    neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense
    that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit
    of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!A cryptocurrency has value because the
    units, analogous to physical coins, are scarce and circulate widely. Both these
    qualities are united in virtual objects, the currency units on the blockchain.
    As described in previous chapters, these properties can catalyze a network effect.
    The units become a currency as increasing amounts of people use it.In contrast,
    tokenized assets are scarce because tokens themselves are scarce or even unique,
    while their value depends on the asset they represent. The liquidity and scarcity
    of tokens depend on the network they reside in, but to appraise the, we also need
    to estimate the underlying asset’s value.Since the launch of altcoins and tokenized
    assets, some have tried to classify these new crypto-assets. Investors, speculators,
    and entrepreneurs need such a classification system to understand what they are
    buying or guide the design and issue of a token. In this chapter, we will only
    look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an entrepreneur who wants to create
    their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping a circular economy.Blockchain
    Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for ideal money, with settlement
    assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any other monetary good (Nic Carter,
    It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019). It can serve as an anchor for
    smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including international transfers, payment
    rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative financial products. For
    the first time in history, these markets are global and neutral, with BTC’s value
    as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense that people now calculate
    global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit of gold: the value of—and
    control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single actor, at least in the
    long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions and products will
    grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin network. We discussed
    the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s goals from the
    outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their vision has changed
    over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system with more possibilities
    and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned the drawbacks of “a larger
    attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc improvisations to technical
    problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems that these criticisms are valid
    yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum is different enough from Bitcoin
    to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful enough as measured by market
    capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that keeps many people interested
    because a few times a year, a team launches something radically new on Ethereum.
    These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens, the Decentralized Autonomous
    Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding curves, etc. These novelties
    tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can fail, have a crisis, or collapse,
    causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought the related assets. These problems
    lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track record as a platform for launching
    new crypto-assets to an existing user base: those who already own and use ETH.
    Any competing blockchain will have to overcome that network effect.Bitcoin critics
    who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining believe in new altcoins with a different
    consensus algorithm. The most common variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the
    block reward according to the amount of currency the miner, or “block producer,”
    has locked-up into a smart contract. Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their
    block’s validity, block producers bet this staked amount on their commitment to
    producing honest blocks. Alternatively, a system can include voting and reputations
    for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However, these types of algorithms are vulnerable
    to a political balance of power. Network participants want cheaper transactions
    on the blockchain, but drawback is a need for governance. To limit the cost of
    the network, developers have to dilute the safety of transactions.Introducing
    governance to a blockchain seems strange to many Bitcoiners because they believe
    in transcending the need for governance through proof-of-work consensus. Governance
    tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the drawbacks of proof-of-work because
    they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability and censorship resistance.
    To them, decentralization is more important than the efficiency of transactions.It
    seems that consensus algorithms that can replace proof-of-work mining are an open
    question for the blockchain industry. Future research and security breaches will
    reveal if governance-based asset networks will win the trust of the market. We
    have to see who wants to transact digital assets that are not quite unstoppable.
    Will people dare to transact pirate business on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum
    as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more centralized than Bitcoin, it might be
    decentralized enough. Its founders are betting on an organizational structure
    with identifiable people. It is a natural path to issuing a token that represents
    a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors see this organizational structure
    as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do not understand Bitcoin in the first
    place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations to fold under pressure from
    adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What will they do when influential
    politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding a ‘hard fork’ to shut down
    an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless of the Ethereum blockchain’s
    long-term security issues, many exciting projects have found a home there. The
    success of some of these projects, and their tokens, attract new buyers of ETH
    and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network effect keeps Ethereum
    alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary protocols for Bitcoin,
    such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities.
    We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum smart contracts could also
    work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment method, and Ethereum’s
    best smart contract applications enter the mainstream, some of these could succeed
    in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of predicting the future success
    of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur, you can keep up with the developments
    in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent opportunity. While you choose a
    product or service to build, know that you are tying the company’s future to the
    network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince the ICO boom, which ran from 2016
    to early 2018, we know that one use of smart contracts is fundraising. Instead
    of getting money from a bank, angel investor, or venture capital firm, you can
    source investment capital from anyone, anywhere, as long they have a wallet with
    crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing field of investment and funding
    a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that could exist as investable cryptocurrencies
    in crypto wallets could exceed the amount of money under the control of professional
    investors. Also, tokenized investing without anyone’s permission speeds up the
    funding of projects, while investors can cash out faster. Many prefer investments
    that triple in value in six months to ones that grow ten times in value but take
    five years.The most straightforward type of funding is issuing security tokens
    . These resemble traditional shares, entitling the holder to a portion of the
    company’s profits. Shareholders are registered in government authority databases
    that oversee financial markets, while banks and brokers intermediate the trading
    of these shares for their clients. Security tokens disintermediate these third
    parties. A company can create a token, say that they represent a share in the
    company’s profit, and promise to pay out these profits to any token holders. The
    blockchain maintains the record of ownership, instead of a central authority.
    Cryptography secures transfer between owners, instead of go-betweens.The open
    playing field for issuing tokens comes with a new risk: new token buyers are often
    not protected by the regulations of conventional financial markets. That attracts
    teams who are better at selling than building things, which includes outright
    scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will have to learn these lessons,
    while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the downfall of tokenized assets.
    No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming years, the genie is out
    of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs who organize funding
    opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary people, often called
    “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment, they will want
    to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will learn how to
    align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams, market manipulations,
    and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these regulations developed
    around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail investors.Some crypto-professionals
    claim that security tokens misapply blockchain technology. Shares divide a corporation
    into pieces and entitle the shareholder to voting rights and profit. This type
    of organization is hundreds of years old, just like writing letters and contracts
    with ink on paper. Launching a security token resembles the post office launching
    a website that publishes its address, phone number, and opening hours while failing
    to prepare for a future in which email replaces most of their service. The only
    situation I view as fitting for a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of
    a traditional corporation. When a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous
    tokens within their jurisdiction, it makes stock ownership possible for anyone,
    including people without a brokerage account. That still looks quite traditional.
    I think that crypto-innovators should aspire to more. For instance, the funding
    of brick-and-mortar companies can improve with tokenized shares or products. You
    can crowdfund on a global scale because you can tokenize your future products,
    which are then tradable. For example, the owners of traditional small businesses,
    such as restaurants, often need bank loans. With the launch of crypto-assets,
    they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer the risk to the customer. By giving
    a significant discount to future customers, they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover,
    you no longer need to put up collateral. This decentralization of small business
    finance allows a broader range of people to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar
    companies. Another example: let’s say you wanted to start a software company in
    a developing nation. You can get funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did
    for consumer products, tokenized assets can do for technology companies and service
    companies.Designing Circular EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit
    the founders of issuing organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their
    projects, but that does not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add
    value for other stakeholders in the project, or fail as an economic instrument.
    Tokens add friction to the experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs
    who put a product behind a token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should
    people install a wallet for crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token,
    or sign up on your website to receive them? They will only do so if the token
    gives them access to otherwise unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized
    assets show the challenge of designing a token that circulates well. These markets
    often have two sides: the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers.
    The issuer opens a marketplace for a tradable resource, for example computing
    power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin). The plan is for suppliers to get paid
    in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers
    or to take profit. The token circulates between these parties as payment for resources.
    It also allows anyone to hold the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance
    when needed.An asset representing access to a network or platform will have prices
    that follow the benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who
    use that network grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token
    holders can sell their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access
    the network.This token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of
    interest between stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation,
    while the utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand.
    The economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith
    & Gomes, The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This
    type of token can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful:
    challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly
    held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful:
    leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable
    resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible
    product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between
    stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace
    demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat
    currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply
    and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent
    responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management
    is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue
    tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to
    give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum

    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!In contrast, tokenized assets are scarce
    because tokens themselves are scarce or even unique, while their value depends
    on the asset they represent. The liquidity and scarcity of tokens depend on the

    the design and issue of a token. In this chapter, we will only look at crypto-assets
    from the perspective of an entrepreneur who wants to create their own, for a)
    funding a project and b) bootstrapping a circular economy.Blockchain Security
    DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for ideal money, with settlement assurances
    orders of magnitude more robust than any other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s

    Opportunities to build these financial functions and products will grow with software
    development that will expand on the Bitcoin network. We discussed the possibilities
    of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s goals from the outset have been different
    from those of Bitcoin. Although their vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders
    have always tried to build a system with more possibilities and lower security
    level. Early critics often mentioned the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.”
    At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc improvisations to technical problems and
    fickle goals for the future. It seems that these criticisms are valid yet do not
    refute the central point: Ethereum is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a
    trail with experiments, and is successful enough as measured by market capitalization.
    It is an open-source blockchain that keeps many people interested because a few
    times a year, a team launches something radically new on Ethereum. These novelties
    include the ERC-20 standard for tokens, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization
    (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply
    but can get in trouble. They can fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss
    for the risk-takers who bought the related assets. These problems lead to criticism,
    yet Ethereum has a track record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets
    to an existing user base: those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain
    will have to overcome that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost
    of proof-of-work mining believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm.
    The most common variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according
    to the amount of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a
    smart contract. Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block
    producers bet this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks.
    Alternatively, a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’
    However, these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power.
    Network participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback
    is a need for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to
    dilute the safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems
    strange to many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance
    through proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept
    the drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid
    to immutability and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important
    than the efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can
    replace proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry.
    Future research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Since the launch of altcoins and tokenized
    assets, some have tried to classify these new crypto-assets. Investors, speculators,
    and entrepreneurs need such a classification system to understand what they are
    buying or guide the design and issue of a token. In this chapter, we will only
    look at crypto-assets from the perspective of an entrepreneur who wants to create
    their own, for a) funding a project and b) bootstrapping a circular economy.Blockchain
    Security DilutionBitcoin is the new standard for ideal money, with settlement
    assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any other monetary good (Nic Carter,
    It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019). It can serve as an anchor for
    smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including international transfers, payment
    rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative financial products. For
    the first time in history, these markets are global and neutral, with BTC’s value
    as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense that people now calculate
    global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit of gold: the value of—and
    control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single actor, at least in the
    long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions and products will
    grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin network. We discussed
    the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s goals from the
    outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their vision has changed
    over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system with more possibilities
    and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned the drawbacks of “a larger
    attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc improvisations to technical
    problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems that these criticisms are valid
    yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum is different enough from Bitcoin
    to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful enough as measured by market
    capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that keeps many people interested
    because a few times a year, a team launches something radically new on Ethereum.
    These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens, the Decentralized Autonomous
    Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding curves, etc. These novelties
    tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can fail, have a crisis, or collapse,
    causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought the related assets. These problems
    lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track record as a platform for launching
    new crypto-assets to an existing user base: those who already own and use ETH.
    Any competing blockchain will have to overcome that network effect.Bitcoin critics
    who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining believe in new altcoins with a different
    consensus algorithm. The most common variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the
    block reward according to the amount of currency the miner, or “block producer,”
    has locked-up into a smart contract. Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their
    block’s validity, block producers bet this staked amount on their commitment to
    producing honest blocks. Alternatively, a system can include voting and reputations
    for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However, these types of algorithms are vulnerable
    to a political balance of power. Network participants want cheaper transactions
    on the blockchain, but drawback is a need for governance. To limit the cost of
    the network, developers have to dilute the safety of transactions.Introducing
    governance to a blockchain seems strange to many Bitcoiners because they believe
    in transcending the need for governance through proof-of-work consensus. Governance
    tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the drawbacks of proof-of-work because
    they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability and censorship resistance.
    To them, decentralization is more important than the efficiency of transactions.It
    seems that consensus algorithms that can replace proof-of-work mining are an open
    question for the blockchain industry. Future research and security breaches will
    reveal if governance-based asset networks will win the trust of the market. We
    have to see who wants to transact digital assets that are not quite unstoppable.
    Will people dare to transact pirate business on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum
    as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more centralized than Bitcoin, it might be
    decentralized enough. Its founders are betting on an organizational structure
    with identifiable people. It is a natural path to issuing a token that represents
    a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors see this organizational structure
    as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do not understand Bitcoin in the first
    place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations to fold under pressure from
    adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What will they do when influential
    politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding a ‘hard fork’ to shut down
    an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless of the Ethereum blockchain’s
    long-term security issues, many exciting projects have found a home there. The
    success of some of these projects, and their tokens, attract new buyers of ETH
    and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network effect keeps Ethereum
    alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary protocols for Bitcoin,
    such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities.
    We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum smart contracts could also
    work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment method, and Ethereum’s
    best smart contract applications enter the mainstream, some of these could succeed
    in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of predicting the future success
    of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur, you can keep up with the developments
    in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent opportunity. While you choose a
    product or service to build, know that you are tying the company’s future to the
    network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince the ICO boom, which ran from 2016
    to early 2018, we know that one use of smart contracts is fundraising. Instead
    of getting money from a bank, angel investor, or venture capital firm, you can
    source investment capital from anyone, anywhere, as long they have a wallet with
    crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing field of investment and funding
    a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that could exist as investable cryptocurrencies
    in crypto wallets could exceed the amount of money under the control of professional
    investors. Also, tokenized investing without anyone’s permission speeds up the
    funding of projects, while investors can cash out faster. Many prefer investments
    that triple in value in six months to ones that grow ten times in value but take
    five years.The most straightforward type of funding is issuing security tokens
    . These resemble traditional shares, entitling the holder to a portion of the
    company’s profits. Shareholders are registered in government authority databases
    that oversee financial markets, while banks and brokers intermediate the trading
    of these shares for their clients. Security tokens disintermediate these third
    parties. A company can create a token, say that they represent a share in the
    company’s profit, and promise to pay out these profits to any token holders. The
    blockchain maintains the record of ownership, instead of a central authority.
    Cryptography secures transfer between owners, instead of go-betweens.The open
    playing field for issuing tokens comes with a new risk: new token buyers are often
    not protected by the regulations of conventional financial markets. That attracts
    teams who are better at selling than building things, which includes outright
    scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will have to learn these lessons,
    while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the downfall of tokenized assets.
    No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming years, the genie is out
    of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs who organize funding
    opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary people, often called
    “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment, they will want
    to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will learn how to
    align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams, market manipulations,
    and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these regulations developed
    around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail investors.Some crypto-professionals
    claim that security tokens misapply blockchain technology. Shares divide a corporation
    into pieces and entitle the shareholder to voting rights and profit. This type
    of organization is hundreds of years old, just like writing letters and contracts
    with ink on paper. Launching a security token resembles the post office launching
    a website that publishes its address, phone number, and opening hours while failing
    to prepare for a future in which email replaces most of their service. The only
    situation I view as fitting for a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of
    a traditional corporation. When a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous
    tokens within their jurisdiction, it makes stock ownership possible for anyone,
    including people without a brokerage account. That still looks quite traditional.
    I think that crypto-innovators should aspire to more. For instance, the funding
    of brick-and-mortar companies can improve with tokenized shares or products. You
    can crowdfund on a global scale because you can tokenize your future products,
    which are then tradable. For example, the owners of traditional small businesses,
    such as restaurants, often need bank loans. With the launch of crypto-assets,
    they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer the risk to the customer. By giving
    a significant discount to future customers, they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover,
    you no longer need to put up collateral. This decentralization of small business
    finance allows a broader range of people to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar
    companies. Another example: let’s say you wanted to start a software company in
    a developing nation. You can get funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did
    for consumer products, tokenized assets can do for technology companies and service
    companies.Designing Circular EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit
    the founders of issuing organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their
    projects, but that does not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add
    value for other stakeholders in the project, or fail as an economic instrument.
    Tokens add friction to the experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs
    who put a product behind a token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should
    people install a wallet for crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token,
    or sign up on your website to receive them? They will only do so if the token
    gives them access to otherwise unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized
    assets show the challenge of designing a token that circulates well. These markets
    often have two sides: the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers.
    The issuer opens a marketplace for a tradable resource, for example computing
    power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin). The plan is for suppliers to get paid
    in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers
    or to take profit. The token circulates between these parties as payment for resources.
    It also allows anyone to hold the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance
    when needed.An asset representing access to a network or platform will have prices
    that follow the benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who
    use that network grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token
    holders can sell their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access
    the network.This token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of
    interest between stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation,
    while the utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand.
    The economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith
    & Gomes, The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This
    type of token can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful:
    challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly
    held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful:
    leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable
    resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible
    product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between
    stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace
    demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat
    currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply
    and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent
    responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management
    is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue
    tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to
    give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Blockchain Security DilutionBitcoin is
    the new standard for ideal money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude
    more robust than any other monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances,
    stupid , 2019). It can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin,
    including international transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements,
    and derivative financial products. For the first time in history, these markets
    are global and neutral, with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal
    in the same sense that people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral
    in the spirit of gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced
    by a single actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial
    functions and products will grow with software development that will expand on
    the Bitcoin network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter
    4.Ethereum’s goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin.
    Although their vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried
    to build a system with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics
    often mentioned the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics
    deride ad-hoc improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future.
    It seems that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point:
    Ethereum is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and
    is successful enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source
    blockchain that keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team
    launches something radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20
    standard for tokens, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties,
    MakerDAO, bonding curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in
    trouble. They can fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers
    who bought the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum
    has a track record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing
    user base: those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have
    to overcome that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work
    mining believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most
    common variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the
    amount of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart
    contract. Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers
    bet this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Bitcoin is the new standard for ideal
    money, with settlement assurances orders of magnitude more robust than any other
    monetary good (Nic Carter, It’s the settlement assurances, stupid , 2019). It
    can serve as an anchor for smart contracts denominated in Bitcoin, including international
    transfers, payment rails, savings, contractual agreements, and derivative financial
    products. For the first time in history, these markets are global and neutral,
    with BTC’s value as a single yardstick. It is universal in the same sense that
    people now calculate global prices in USD, and it is neutral in the spirit of
    gold: the value of—and control over—gold can hardly be influenced by a single
    actor, at least in the long term. Opportunities to build these financial functions
    and products will grow with software development that will expand on the Bitcoin
    network. We discussed the possibilities of Lightning Network in chapter 4.Ethereum’s
    goals from the outset have been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their
    vision has changed over time, Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system
    with more possibilities and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned
    the drawbacks of “a larger attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc
    improvisations to technical problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems
    that these criticisms are valid yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum
    is different enough from Bitcoin to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful
    enough as measured by market capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that
    keeps many people interested because a few times a year, a team launches something
    radically new on Ethereum. These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens,
    the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding
    curves, etc. These novelties tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can
    fail, have a crisis, or collapse, causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought
    the related assets. These problems lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track
    record as a platform for launching new crypto-assets to an existing user base:
    those who already own and use ETH. Any competing blockchain will have to overcome
    that network effect.Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining
    believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm. The most common
    variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according to the amount
    of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a smart contract.
    Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block producers bet
    this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks. Alternatively,
    a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However,
    these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power. Network
    participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback is a need
    for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to dilute the
    safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems strange to
    many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance through
    proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the
    drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability
    and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important than the
    efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can replace
    proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry. Future
    research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate

    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Ethereum’s goals from the outset have
    been different from those of Bitcoin. Although their vision has changed over time,
    Ethereum founders have always tried to build a system with more possibilities
    and lower security level. Early critics often mentioned the drawbacks of “a larger
    attack surface.” At the moment, critics deride ad-hoc improvisations to technical
    problems and fickle goals for the future. It seems that these criticisms are valid
    yet do not refute the central point: Ethereum is different enough from Bitcoin
    to blaze a trail with experiments, and is successful enough as measured by market
    capitalization. It is an open-source blockchain that keeps many people interested
    because a few times a year, a team launches something radically new on Ethereum.
    These novelties include the ERC-20 standard for tokens, the Decentralized Autonomous
    Organization (DAO), CryptoKitties, MakerDAO, bonding curves, etc. These novelties
    tend to multiply but can get in trouble. They can fail, have a crisis, or collapse,
    causing a loss for the risk-takers who bought the related assets. These problems
    lead to criticism, yet Ethereum has a track record as a platform for launching
    new crypto-assets to an existing user base: those who already own and use ETH.
    Any competing blockchain will have to overcome that network effect.Bitcoin critics
    who focus on the cost of proof-of-work mining believe in new altcoins with a different
    consensus algorithm. The most common variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the
    block reward according to the amount of currency the miner, or “block producer,”
    has locked-up into a smart contract. Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their
    block’s validity, block producers bet this staked amount on their commitment to
    producing honest blocks. Alternatively, a system can include voting and reputations
    for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’ However, these types of algorithms are vulnerable
    to a political balance of power. Network participants want cheaper transactions
    on the blockchain, but drawback is a need for governance. To limit the cost of
    the network, developers have to dilute the safety of transactions.Introducing
    governance to a blockchain seems strange to many Bitcoiners because they believe
    in transcending the need for governance through proof-of-work consensus. Governance
    tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept the drawbacks of proof-of-work because
    they value decentralization, as an aid to immutability and censorship resistance.
    To them, decentralization is more important than the efficiency of transactions.It
    seems that consensus algorithms that can replace proof-of-work mining are an open
    question for the blockchain industry. Future research and security breaches will
    reveal if governance-based asset networks will win the trust of the market. We
    have to see who wants to transact digital assets that are not quite unstoppable.
    Will people dare to transact pirate business on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum
    as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more centralized than Bitcoin, it might be
    decentralized enough. Its founders are betting on an organizational structure
    with identifiable people. It is a natural path to issuing a token that represents
    a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors see this organizational structure
    as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do not understand Bitcoin in the first
    place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations to fold under pressure from
    adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What will they do when influential
    politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding a ‘hard fork’ to shut down
    an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless of the Ethereum blockchain’s
    long-term security issues, many exciting projects have found a home there. The
    success of some of these projects, and their tokens, attract new buyers of ETH
    and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network effect keeps Ethereum
    alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary protocols for Bitcoin,
    such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities.
    We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum smart contracts could also
    work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment method, and Ethereum’s
    best smart contract applications enter the mainstream, some of these could succeed
    in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of predicting the future success
    of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur, you can keep up with the developments
    in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent opportunity. While you choose a
    product or service to build, know that you are tying the company’s future to the
    network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince the ICO boom, which ran from 2016
    to early 2018, we know that one use of smart contracts is fundraising. Instead
    of getting money from a bank, angel investor, or venture capital firm, you can
    source investment capital from anyone, anywhere, as long they have a wallet with
    crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing field of investment and funding
    a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that could exist as investable cryptocurrencies
    in crypto wallets could exceed the amount of money under the control of professional
    investors. Also, tokenized investing without anyone’s permission speeds up the
    funding of projects, while investors can cash out faster. Many prefer investments
    that triple in value in six months to ones that grow ten times in value but take
    five years.The most straightforward type of funding is issuing security tokens
    . These resemble traditional shares, entitling the holder to a portion of the
    company’s profits. Shareholders are registered in government authority databases
    that oversee financial markets, while banks and brokers intermediate the trading
    of these shares for their clients. Security tokens disintermediate these third
    parties. A company can create a token, say that they represent a share in the
    company’s profit, and promise to pay out these profits to any token holders. The
    blockchain maintains the record of ownership, instead of a central authority.
    Cryptography secures transfer between owners, instead of go-betweens.The open
    playing field for issuing tokens comes with a new risk: new token buyers are often
    not protected by the regulations of conventional financial markets. That attracts
    teams who are better at selling than building things, which includes outright
    scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will have to learn these lessons,
    while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the downfall of tokenized assets.
    No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming years, the genie is out
    of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs who organize funding
    opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary people, often called
    “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment, they will want
    to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will learn how to
    align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams, market manipulations,
    and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these regulations developed
    around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail investors.Some crypto-professionals
    claim that security tokens misapply blockchain technology. Shares divide a corporation
    into pieces and entitle the shareholder to voting rights and profit. This type
    of organization is hundreds of years old, just like writing letters and contracts
    with ink on paper. Launching a security token resembles the post office launching
    a website that publishes its address, phone number, and opening hours while failing
    to prepare for a future in which email replaces most of their service. The only
    situation I view as fitting for a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of
    a traditional corporation. When a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous
    tokens within their jurisdiction, it makes stock ownership possible for anyone,
    including people without a brokerage account. That still looks quite traditional.
    I think that crypto-innovators should aspire to more. For instance, the funding
    of brick-and-mortar companies can improve with tokenized shares or products. You
    can crowdfund on a global scale because you can tokenize your future products,
    which are then tradable. For example, the owners of traditional small businesses,
    such as restaurants, often need bank loans. With the launch of crypto-assets,
    they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer the risk to the customer. By giving
    a significant discount to future customers, they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover,
    you no longer need to put up collateral. This decentralization of small business
    finance allows a broader range of people to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar
    companies. Another example: let’s say you wanted to start a software company in
    a developing nation. You can get funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did
    for consumer products, tokenized assets can do for technology companies and service
    companies.Designing Circular EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit
    the founders of issuing organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their
    projects, but that does not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add
    value for other stakeholders in the project, or fail as an economic instrument.
    Tokens add friction to the experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs
    who put a product behind a token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should
    people install a wallet for crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token,
    or sign up on your website to receive them? They will only do so if the token
    gives them access to otherwise unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized
    assets show the challenge of designing a token that circulates well. These markets
    often have two sides: the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers.
    The issuer opens a marketplace for a tradable resource, for example computing
    power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin). The plan is for suppliers to get paid
    in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers
    or to take profit. The token circulates between these parties as payment for resources.
    It also allows anyone to hold the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance
    when needed.An asset representing access to a network or platform will have prices
    that follow the benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who
    use that network grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token
    holders can sell their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access
    the network.This token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of
    interest between stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation,
    while the utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand.
    The economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith
    & Gomes, The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This
    type of token can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful:
    challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly
    held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful:
    leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable
    resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible
    product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between
    stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace
    demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat
    currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply
    and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent
    responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management
    is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue
    tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to
    give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming

    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Bitcoin critics who focus on the cost
    of proof-of-work mining believe in new altcoins with a different consensus algorithm.
    The most common variant is proof-of-stake, which awards the block reward according
    to the amount of currency the miner, or “block producer,” has locked-up into a
    smart contract. Instead of ‘betting’ electricity on their block’s validity, block
    producers bet this staked amount on their commitment to producing honest blocks.
    Alternatively, a system can include voting and reputations for ‘delegated proof-of-stake.’
    However, these types of algorithms are vulnerable to a political balance of power.
    Network participants want cheaper transactions on the blockchain, but drawback
    is a need for governance. To limit the cost of the network, developers have to
    dilute the safety of transactions.Introducing governance to a blockchain seems
    strange to many Bitcoiners because they believe in transcending the need for governance
    through proof-of-work consensus. Governance tends to centralize. Bitcoiners accept
    the drawbacks of proof-of-work because they value decentralization, as an aid
    to immutability and censorship resistance. To them, decentralization is more important
    than the efficiency of transactions.It seems that consensus algorithms that can
    replace proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry.
    Future research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Introducing governance to a blockchain

    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!It seems that consensus algorithms that
    can replace proof-of-work mining are an open question for the blockchain industry.
    Future research and security breaches will reveal if governance-based asset networks
    will win the trust of the market. We have to see who wants to transact digital
    assets that are not quite unstoppable. Will people dare to transact pirate business
    on Ethereum without trouble?Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum is more
    centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders are betting
    on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural path
    to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand, detractors
    see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of Ethereum do
    not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and its organizations
    to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a nation-state. What
    will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland office, demanding
    a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The

    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Ethereum as a LaboratoryAlthough Ethereum
    is more centralized than Bitcoin, it might be decentralized enough. Its founders
    are betting on an organizational structure with identifiable people. It is a natural
    path to issuing a token that represents a claim to an asset. On the other hand,
    detractors see this organizational structure as evidence that the founders of
    Ethereum do not understand Bitcoin in the first place. They expect Ethereum and
    its organizations to fold under pressure from adversaries with the power of a
    nation-state. What will they do when influential politicians call their Switzerland
    office, demanding a ‘hard fork’ to shut down an ICO crowdfunding his or her opponents?Regardless
    of the Ethereum blockchain’s long-term security issues, many exciting projects
    have found a home there. The success of some of these projects, and their tokens,
    attract new buyers of ETH and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network
    effect keeps Ethereum alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The

    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Regardless of the Ethereum blockchain’s
    long-term security issues, many exciting projects have found a home there. The
    success of some of these projects, and their tokens, attract new buyers of ETH
    and more developers to the ecosystem. So far, this network effect keeps Ethereum
    alive and growing.Developers continue to build secondary protocols for Bitcoin,
    such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities.
    We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum smart contracts could also
    work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment method, and Ethereum’s
    best smart contract applications enter the mainstream, some of these could succeed
    in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of predicting the future success
    of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur, you can keep up with the developments
    in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent opportunity. While you choose a
    product or service to build, know that you are tying the company’s future to the
    network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince the ICO boom, which ran from 2016
    to early 2018, we know that one use of smart contracts is fundraising. Instead
    of getting money from a bank, angel investor, or venture capital firm, you can
    source investment capital from anyone, anywhere, as long they have a wallet with
    crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing field of investment and funding
    a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that could exist as investable cryptocurrencies
    in crypto wallets could exceed the amount of money under the control of professional
    investors. Also, tokenized investing without anyone’s permission speeds up the
    funding of projects, while investors can cash out faster. Many prefer investments
    that triple in value in six months to ones that grow ten times in value but take
    five years.The most straightforward type of funding is issuing security tokens
    . These resemble traditional shares, entitling the holder to a portion of the
    company’s profits. Shareholders are registered in government authority databases
    that oversee financial markets, while banks and brokers intermediate the trading
    of these shares for their clients. Security tokens disintermediate these third
    parties. A company can create a token, say that they represent a share in the
    company’s profit, and promise to pay out these profits to any token holders. The
    blockchain maintains the record of ownership, instead of a central authority.
    Cryptography secures transfer between owners, instead of go-betweens.The open
    playing field for issuing tokens comes with a new risk: new token buyers are often
    not protected by the regulations of conventional financial markets. That attracts
    teams who are better at selling than building things, which includes outright
    scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will have to learn these lessons,
    while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the downfall of tokenized assets.
    No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming years, the genie is out
    of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs who organize funding
    opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary people, often called
    “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment, they will want
    to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will learn how to
    align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams, market manipulations,
    and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these regulations developed
    around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail investors.Some crypto-professionals
    claim that security tokens misapply blockchain technology. Shares divide a corporation
    into pieces and entitle the shareholder to voting rights and profit. This type
    of organization is hundreds of years old, just like writing letters and contracts
    with ink on paper. Launching a security token resembles the post office launching
    a website that publishes its address, phone number, and opening hours while failing
    to prepare for a future in which email replaces most of their service. The only
    situation I view as fitting for a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of
    a traditional corporation. When a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous
    tokens within their jurisdiction, it makes stock ownership possible for anyone,
    including people without a brokerage account. That still looks quite traditional.
    I think that crypto-innovators should aspire to more. For instance, the funding
    of brick-and-mortar companies can improve with tokenized shares or products. You
    can crowdfund on a global scale because you can tokenize your future products,
    which are then tradable. For example, the owners of traditional small businesses,

    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Developers continue to build secondary
    protocols for Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, expanding
    Bitcoin’s inherent capabilities. We can imagine how the best applications of Ethereum
    smart contracts could also work with Bitcoin. If bitcoins are a universal payment
    method, and Ethereum’s best smart contract applications enter the mainstream,
    some of these could succeed in the Bitcoin network.For now, we have no way of
    predicting the future success of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. As an entrepreneur,
    you can keep up with the developments in both ecosystems until you spot an excellent
    opportunity. While you choose a product or service to build, know that you are
    tying the company’s future to the network you build on.Tokenized FundraisingSince
    the ICO boom, which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart
    contracts is fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor,
    or venture capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere,
    as long they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing
    field of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that
    could exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the
    amount of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming

    situation I view as fitting for a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of
    a traditional corporation. When a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous
    tokens within their jurisdiction, it makes stock ownership possible for anyone,
    including people without a brokerage account. That still looks quite traditional.
    I think that crypto-innovators should aspire to more. For instance, the funding
    of brick-and-mortar companies can improve with tokenized shares or products. You
    can crowdfund on a global scale because you can tokenize your future products,
    which are then tradable. For example, the owners of traditional small businesses,
    such as restaurants, often need bank loans. With the launch of crypto-assets,
    they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer the risk to the customer. By giving
    a significant discount to future customers, they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover,
    you no longer need to put up collateral. This decentralization of small business
    finance allows a broader range of people to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar
    companies. Another example: let’s say you wanted to start a software company in
    a developing nation. You can get funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did
    for consumer products, tokenized assets can do for technology companies and service
    companies.Designing Circular EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit
    the founders of issuing organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their
    projects, but that does not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add
    value for other stakeholders in the project, or fail as an economic instrument.
    Tokens add friction to the experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs
    who put a product behind a token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should
    people install a wallet for crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token,
    or sign up on your website to receive them? They will only do so if the token
    gives them access to otherwise unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized
    assets show the challenge of designing a token that circulates well. These markets
    often have two sides: the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers.
    The issuer opens a marketplace for a tradable resource, for example computing
    power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin). The plan is for suppliers to get paid
    in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers
    or to take profit. The token circulates between these parties as payment for resources.
    It also allows anyone to hold the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance
    when needed.An asset representing access to a network or platform will have prices
    that follow the benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who
    use that network grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token
    holders can sell their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access
    the network.This token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of
    interest between stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation,
    while the utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand.
    The economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith
    & Gomes, The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This
    type of token can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful:
    challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly
    held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful:
    leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable
    resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible
    product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between
    stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace
    demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat
    currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply
    and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent
    responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management
    is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue
    tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to
    give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Tokenized FundraisingSince the ICO boom,
    which ran from 2016 to early 2018, we know that one use of smart contracts is
    fundraising. Instead of getting money from a bank, angel investor, or venture
    capital firm, you can source investment capital from anyone, anywhere, as long
    they have a wallet with crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing field
    of investment and funding a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that could
    exist as investable cryptocurrencies in crypto wallets could exceed the amount
    of money under the control of professional investors. Also, tokenized investing
    without anyone’s permission speeds up the funding of projects, while investors
    can cash out faster. Many prefer investments that triple in value in six months
    to ones that grow ten times in value but take five years.The most straightforward
    type of funding is issuing security tokens . These resemble traditional shares,
    entitling the holder to a portion of the company’s profits. Shareholders are registered
    in government authority databases that oversee financial markets, while banks
    and brokers intermediate the trading of these shares for their clients. Security
    tokens disintermediate these third parties. A company can create a token, say
    that they represent a share in the company’s profit, and promise to pay out these
    profits to any token holders. The blockchain maintains the record of ownership,
    instead of a central authority. Cryptography secures transfer between owners,
    instead of go-betweens.The open playing field for issuing tokens comes with a
    new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations of conventional
    financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling than building
    things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will
    have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the
    downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming
    years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a

    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Since the ICO boom, which ran from 2016
    to early 2018, we know that one use of smart contracts is fundraising. Instead
    of getting money from a bank, angel investor, or venture capital firm, you can
    source investment capital from anyone, anywhere, as long they have a wallet with
    crypto-assets. That expands the potential playing field of investment and funding
    a hundred times over. The amount of wealth that could exist as investable cryptocurrencies
    in crypto wallets could exceed the amount of money under the control of professional
    investors. Also, tokenized investing without anyone’s permission speeds up the
    funding of projects, while investors can cash out faster. Many prefer investments
    that triple in value in six months to ones that grow ten times in value but take
    five years.The most straightforward type of funding is issuing security tokens
    . These resemble traditional shares, entitling the holder to a portion of the
    company’s profits. Shareholders are registered in government authority databases
    that oversee financial markets, while banks and brokers intermediate the trading
    of these shares for their clients. Security tokens disintermediate these third
    parties. A company can create a token, say that they represent a share in the
    company’s profit, and promise to pay out these profits to any token holders. The
    blockchain maintains the record of ownership, instead of a central authority.
    Cryptography secures transfer between owners, instead of go-betweens.The open
    playing field for issuing tokens comes with a new risk: new token buyers are often
    not protected by the regulations of conventional financial markets. That attracts
    teams who are better at selling than building things, which includes outright
    scammers. Optimists maintain that the market will have to learn these lessons,
    while pessimists expect these dynamics to be the downfall of tokenized assets.
    No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding in coming years, the genie is out
    of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs who organize funding
    opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary people, often called
    “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment, they will want
    to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will learn how to
    align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams, market manipulations,
    and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these regulations developed
    around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail investors.Some crypto-professionals
    claim that security tokens misapply blockchain technology. Shares divide a corporation
    into pieces and entitle the shareholder to voting rights and profit. This type
    of organization is hundreds of years old, just like writing letters and contracts
    with ink on paper. Launching a security token resembles the post office launching
    a website that publishes its address, phone number, and opening hours while failing
    to prepare for a future in which email replaces most of their service. The only
    situation I view as fitting for a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of
    a traditional corporation. When a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous
    tokens within their jurisdiction, it makes stock ownership possible for anyone,
    including people without a brokerage account. That still looks quite traditional.
    I think that crypto-innovators should aspire to more. For instance, the funding
    of brick-and-mortar companies can improve with tokenized shares or products. You
    can crowdfund on a global scale because you can tokenize your future products,
    which are then tradable. For example, the owners of traditional small businesses,
    such as restaurants, often need bank loans. With the launch of crypto-assets,
    they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer the risk to the customer. By giving
    a significant discount to future customers, they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover,
    you no longer need to put up collateral. This decentralization of small business
    finance allows a broader range of people to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar
    companies. Another example: let’s say you wanted to start a software company in
    a developing nation. You can get funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did
    for consumer products, tokenized assets can do for technology companies and service
    companies.Designing Circular EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit
    the founders of issuing organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their
    projects, but that does not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add
    value for other stakeholders in the project, or fail as an economic instrument.
    Tokens add friction to the experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs
    who put a product behind a token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should
    people install a wallet for crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token,
    or sign up on your website to receive them? They will only do so if the token
    gives them access to otherwise unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized
    assets show the challenge of designing a token that circulates well. These markets
    often have two sides: the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers.
    The issuer opens a marketplace for a tradable resource, for example computing
    power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin). The plan is for suppliers to get paid
    in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers
    or to take profit. The token circulates between these parties as payment for resources.
    It also allows anyone to hold the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance
    when needed.An asset representing access to a network or platform will have prices
    that follow the benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who
    use that network grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token
    holders can sell their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access
    the network.This token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of
    interest between stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation,
    while the utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand.
    The economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith
    & Gomes, The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This
    type of token can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful:
    challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly
    held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful:
    leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable
    resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible
    product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between
    stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace
    demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat
    currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply
    and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent
    responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management
    is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue
    tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to
    give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy

    type of token can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful:
    challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly
    held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful:
    leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable
    resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible
    product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between
    stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace
    demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat
    currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply
    and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent
    responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management
    is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue
    tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to
    give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!The open playing field for issuing tokens
    comes with a new risk: new token buyers are often not protected by the regulations
    of conventional financial markets. That attracts teams who are better at selling
    than building things, which includes outright scammers. Optimists maintain that
    the market will have to learn these lessons, while pessimists expect these dynamics
    to be the downfall of tokenized assets. No matter the outcomes of tokenized funding
    in coming years, the genie is out of the bottle.Regulators will have to battle
    entrepreneurs who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions.
    When ordinary people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized
    returns on investment, they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile,
    fundraisers will learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate
    the risk of scams, market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional
    finance, these regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with
    the rise of retail investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens
    misapply blockchain technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle
    the shareholder to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds
    of years old, just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching
    a security token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes
    its address, phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future
    in which email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting
    for a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation.
    When a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their
    jurisdiction, it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without
    a brokerage account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators
    should aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies
    can improve with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale
    because you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example,
    the owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank
    loans. With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to
    defer the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,

    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized

    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Regulators will have to battle entrepreneurs
    who organize funding opportunities from competing jurisdictions. When ordinary
    people, often called “retail investors,” get a taste of outsized returns on investment,
    they will want to keep accessing these opportunities. Meanwhile, fundraisers will
    learn how to align incentives across stakeholders and mitigate the risk of scams,
    market manipulations, and unsophisticated investors. In traditional finance, these
    regulations developed around the turn of the 20th century, with the rise of retail
    investors.Some crypto-professionals claim that security tokens misapply blockchain
    technology. Shares divide a corporation into pieces and entitle the shareholder
    to voting rights and profit. This type of organization is hundreds of years old,
    just like writing letters and contracts with ink on paper. Launching a security
    token resembles the post office launching a website that publishes its address,
    phone number, and opening hours while failing to prepare for a future in which
    email replaces most of their service. The only situation I view as fitting for
    a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional corporation. When
    a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens within their jurisdiction,
    it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including people without a brokerage
    account. That still looks quite traditional. I think that crypto-innovators should
    aspire to more. For instance, the funding of brick-and-mortar companies can improve
    with tokenized shares or products. You can crowdfund on a global scale because
    you can tokenize your future products, which are then tradable. For example, the
    owners of traditional small businesses, such as restaurants, often need bank loans.
    With the launch of crypto-assets, they can instead sell prepaid meals to defer
    the risk to the customer. By giving a significant discount to future customers,
    they could disintermediate the bank.Moreover, you no longer need to put up collateral.
    This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range of people
    to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example: let’s
    say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can get
    funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating

    I view as fitting for a securities token is pseudonymous ownership of a traditional
    corporation. When a financial regulator allows the trade of pseudonymous tokens
    within their jurisdiction, it makes stock ownership possible for anyone, including
    people without a brokerage account. That still looks quite traditional. I think

    products, tokenized assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing

    of issuing organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but
    that does not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other
    stakeholders in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction
    to the experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind

    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Moreover, you no longer need to put up
    collateral. This decentralization of small business finance allows a broader range
    of people to start a restaurant or other brick-and-mortar companies. Another example:
    let’s say you wanted to start a software company in a developing nation. You can
    get funding from anybody. What Kickstarter.com did for consumer products, tokenized
    assets can do for technology companies and service companies.Designing Circular
    EconomiesThe section above shows how tokens can benefit the founders of issuing
    organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for their projects, but that does
    not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have to add value for other stakeholders
    in the project, or fail as an economic instrument. Tokens add friction to the
    experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs who put a product behind a
    token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should people install a wallet for
    crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token, or sign up on your website
    to receive them? They will only do so if the token gives them access to otherwise
    unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized assets show the challenge
    of designing a token that circulates well. These markets often have two sides:
    the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers. The issuer opens a marketplace
    for a tradable resource, for example computing power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin).
    The plan is for suppliers to get paid in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency
    or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers or to take profit. The token circulates
    between these parties as payment for resources. It also allows anyone to hold
    the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance when needed.An asset
    representing access to a network or platform will have prices that follow the
    benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who use that network
    grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token holders can sell
    their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access the network.This
    token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of interest between
    stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation, while the
    utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand. The
    economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes,
    The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This type of token
    can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful: challenging
    to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly held by speculators,
    regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful: leads to hoarding
    and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable resource.•    Highly
    available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible product or service
    with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between stakeholders by
    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The

    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!The section above shows how tokens can
    benefit the founders of issuing organizations. Entrepreneurs can get funding for
    their projects, but that does not in itself make tokens valuable. Tokens have
    to add value for other stakeholders in the project, or fail as an economic instrument.
    Tokens add friction to the experience of the product, therefore entrepreneurs
    who put a product behind a token ‘gate’ have to justify that choice. Why should
    people install a wallet for crypto-assets, go to an exchange to buy the token,
    or sign up on your website to receive them? They will only do so if the token
    gives them access to otherwise unavailable assets.The first generation of tokenized
    assets show the challenge of designing a token that circulates well. These markets
    often have two sides: the platform for trading serves both buyers and sellers.
    The issuer opens a marketplace for a tradable resource, for example computing
    power (Golem) or data storage (Filecoin). The plan is for suppliers to get paid
    in the coin, and to sell it for fiat currency or cryptocurrency to pay their suppliers
    or to take profit. The token circulates between these parties as payment for resources.
    It also allows anyone to hold the traded supply in reserve, use it later, or rebalance
    when needed.An asset representing access to a network or platform will have prices
    that follow the benefits and value of that network. As the number of people who
    use that network grows along with the system’s usefulness, demand rises. Token
    holders can sell their tokens for a profit, instead of using their tokens to access
    the network.This token-mediated exchange of resources can cause a conflict of
    interest between stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number of tokens in circulation,
    while the utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends on the resource’s demand.
    The economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith
    & Gomes, The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen & Overy, 2017). This
    type of token can end up in four positions:•    Highly available, but not so useful:
    challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly
    held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful:
    leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable
    resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible
    product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between
    stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace
    demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat
    currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply
    and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent
    responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management
    is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue
    tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to
    give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress

    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!An asset representing access to a network
    or platform will have prices that follow the benefits and value of that network.
    As the number of people who use that network grows along with the system’s usefulness,
    demand rises. Token holders can sell their tokens for a profit, instead of using
    their tokens to access the network.This token-mediated exchange of resources can
    cause a conflict of interest between stakeholders. The issuer chooses the number
    of tokens in circulation, while the utility, i.e., the benefit to the users, depends
    on the resource’s demand. The economics are described in the ‘Benefit and Scarcity
    Matrix’ (Sehra, Smith & Gomes, The Economics of Initial Coin Offerings , Allen
    & Overy, 2017). This type of token can end up in four positions:•    Highly available,
    but not so useful: challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not
    so useful: mainly held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce,
    and useful: leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for
    the tradable resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires
    a tangible product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions
    between stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to
    marketplace demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that
    of a fiat currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage
    the supply and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to
    be an innocent responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized
    management is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects
    to issue tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with
    ways to give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two

    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!•    Highly available, but not so useful:
    challenging to circulate, unstable price.•    Scarce, but not so useful: mainly
    held by speculators, regulators could view it as a security.•    Scarce, and useful:
    leads to hoarding and deflation, causing friction in the market for the tradable
    resource.•    Highly available and useful: stable price, but requires a tangible
    product or service with known demand.Some projects resolved these tensions between
    stakeholders by issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace
    demand. The role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat
    currency central bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply
    and serve the interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent
    responsibility with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management
    is against this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue
    tokens with distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to
    give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many

    issuing their tokens slowly, adjusting the release to marketplace demand. The
    role they play in their token economy is similar to that of a fiat currency central
    bank; the token holders have to trust them to manage the supply and serve the
    interest of all the stakeholders. While that seemed to be an innocent responsibility
    with the first generation of digital assets, centralized management is against
    this technology’s spirit, so we can expect future projects to issue tokens with
    distributed control.Token designers are experimenting with ways to give stakeholders
    a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial teams are ‘failing
    their way forward’ to the right models for token governance, such as with the
    Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake models, and
    MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable operation
    of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain a delicate
    balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having the final
    say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence, how to infuse
    other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network is widespread,
    none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners, or developers,
    can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests. If any
    of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the software
    that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only have a
    smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this is called
    a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network is only
    as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new model
    for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!•    Highly available and useful: stable

    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Token designers are experimenting with
    ways to give stakeholders a proportionate voice or control in a project. Entrepreneurial
    teams are ‘failing their way forward’ to the right models for token governance,
    such as with the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), proof-of-stake
    models, and MakerDAO. A standard to live up to is the decentralized, yet stable
    operation of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin proves that stakeholders can maintain
    a delicate balance of power within a system of incentives, without any party having
    the final say. The question that other projects are exploring is, in essence,
    how to infuse other systems with the same qualities.Once a blockchain network
    is widespread, none of the participants, whether they are traders, holders, miners,
    or developers, can force changes to the system against others participants’ interests.
    If any of these groups try to change the rules, but the others stick with the
    software that applies the original rules, that means the rule-changers will only
    have a smaller, isolated network. In the jargon of open source software, this
    is called a ‘fork.’ The network effect ensures that a forked blockchain network
    is only as valuable as the number of people joining it.A new project with a new
    model for keeping a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To
    what degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin
    or Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live
    up to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized
    network depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers
    inside of a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers
    is described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of
    the novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the

    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!A new project with a new model for keeping
    a balance of power gets scrutinized on its degree of decentralization—To what
    degree can its open transactions resist authoritarian censorship? As Bitcoin or
    Ethereum inspire you, and you build something new, how will you make it live up
    to the standard set by these systems?Game-Theoretical BalanceA decentralized network
    depends on a careful balance of interests between the decision-makers inside of
    a financial ecosystem. The strategic interactions of these decision-makers is
    described by a branch of mathematics called game theory . The designers of the
    novel Bitcoin-inspired systems tweak the candidate network parameters, aiming
    to support transactions. Besides the technical challenges related to cryptography
    and computer science, the design must foster relationships between mostly pseudonymous
    decision-makers. Each type of network participant needs reasons to a) play by
    the rules and b) enforce the rules for others. Game theory informs the design
    of a stable blockchain network.The balance of rules and interests is critical;
    the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt to invent
    a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In 2020, a branch
    of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows promise. It started
    with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary banking products,
    such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin, Dai, results from
    a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens. As I write this, some
    teams are launching financial products that have not existed before, and cannot
    exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin Dai deserves special
    mention because it supports many other products in decentralized finance. A stablecoin,
    or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply and function, is a must-have
    for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later on, crypto-dollars could become
    obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem need assets to protect them
    from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case study in achieving strategic
    balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur launching a token, you
    benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s education starts
    with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.
    You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO whitepaper.Non-Fungible
    TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible
    tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then a non-fungible token is
    ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that one unit of the token
    is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment in dollars, bitcoin,
    or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive, when they were minted,
    and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just as with fiat currency
    and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that the owner can send from
    one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable with any other token.
    It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become
    non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title
    deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital collectibles such
    as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy

    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!The balance of rules and interests is
    critical; the founders of any project either borrow a proven model or attempt
    to invent a new one. So far, Ethereum is home to most of these experiments. In
    2020, a branch of these experiments called ‘decentralized finance (DeFi)’ shows
    promise. It started with creating pseudonymous and transparent versions of ordinary
    banking products, such as savings and loans. The first decentralized stablecoin,
    Dai, results from a strategic balance between the holders of multiple tokens.
    As I write this, some teams are launching financial products that have not existed
    before, and cannot exist, within the methods of traditional finance.The stablecoin
    Dai deserves special mention because it supports many other products in decentralized
    finance. A stablecoin, or crypto-dollar, which is entirely transparent in supply
    and function, is a must-have for the current adoption of crypto-assets. Later
    on, crypto-dollars could become obsolete, but as it is, the players in this ecosystem
    need assets to protect them from unwanted volatility. Furthermore, Dai is a case
    study in achieving strategic balance in the sense of game theory. As an entrepreneur
    launching a token, you benefit from knowing how that balance works. An entrepreneur’s
    education starts with Bitcoin, continues with Ethereum, and advances with MakerDAO’s
    Dai stablecoin. You can read an overview of the functioning of Dai in the MakerDAO
    whitepaper.Non-Fungible TokensBesides currency and tokens, another class of crypto-assets
    relies on non-fungible tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’ then
    a non-fungible token is ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means that
    one unit of the token is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a payment
    in dollars, bitcoin, or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive,
    when they were minted, and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just
    as with fiat currency and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that
    the owner can send from one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable
    with any other token. It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets
    that could become non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable
    digital identities.•    Title deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital
    collectibles such as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The

    to another is not interchangeable with any other token. It represents or refers
    to a unique asset. Examples of assets that could become non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual,
    secure, but tradable digital identities.•    Title deeds of real estate, vehicles,

    successfully in a game by AxiomZen , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched
    in 2017\. The goal was to collect, breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have
    genes that interact and can express specific traits. The challenge for the players
    is to figure out how a trait depends on which genes to breed rare cats. You can
    sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent it out for breeding. Some breeders have made
    quite a lot of ETH playing this game. Other players must have lost money if they

    Players no longer depend on the gaming company to steward their in-game assets,
    particularly, the cats. As tokens at an Ethereum address, players have full control
    over them. Transactions and breeding results are immutable. Although they still
    rely on the central game engine, which runs on the company’s servers, anyone could
    build a game engine that interprets the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats
    on a website.Representing in-game items as tokens gives rise to another possibility:
    developing a new game that repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example,
    KittyRace lets you race any of your CryptoKitties against those of other players.
    You bet ETH on your kitty, and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics
    led to some players breeding cats with features that made them good at winning
    races: a feedback loop between the two games about the same set of in-game assets.
    Another project is KittyHats , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories.
    These projects suggest that a robust network effect will bring more players and
    developers, inspired to build new decentralized games that use the existing in-game
    assets.CryptoKitties is a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before
    this game, people who handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical
    innovation, financial gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people
    would transact a crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always
    assets to be sold; they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players
    can enjoy breeding, collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the
    technology that makes it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts,
    and many play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong
    proved that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Besides currency and tokens, another class
    of crypto-assets relies on non-fungible tokens . If Bitcoin is ‘money with a blockchain,’
    then a non-fungible token is ‘a collectible with a blockchain.’ “Fungible” means
    that one unit of the token is interchangeable with any other. If you receive a
    payment in dollars, bitcoin, or ETH, you don’t care which specific units you receive,
    when they were minted, and where they have been before. A coin is a coin, just
    as with fiat currency and casino chips. In contrast, a non-fungible token that
    the owner can send from one blockchain address to another is not interchangeable
    with any other token. It represents or refers to a unique asset. Examples of assets
    that could become non-fungible tokens are:•    Individual, secure, but tradable
    digital identities.•    Title deeds of real estate, vehicles, and works of art.•    Digital
    collectibles such as digital art or rare items inside of a game or virtual reality.•    Digital
    tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible tokens introduce a new dimension of
    scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset. In the case of crypto-currency,
    its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern the issuance and transfer of the
    token. These public and verifiable rules ensure the scarcity of each of the units
    of the token. A non-fungible token relies on its blockchain to provide an additional
    guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There is a limited number of units of this
    token in circulation, where for most use cases, it is unique and refers to a single
    asset.The applications on non-fungible tokens I listed above are all promising.
    However, they each have unresolved issues. I am excited about the individual attempts
    of some existing projects, and I recommend these areas as sources of entrepreneurial
    opportunity.Besides financial applications, the area that is showing the most
    promise is online games. Gaming startups that figure out how to make online gaming
    more enjoyable for players can tap into a vast market.Digital Collectibles in
    GamesNon-fungible tokens were first applied successfully in a game by AxiomZen
    , as part of the game CryptoKitties , launched in 2017\. The goal was to collect,
    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is

    breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact and can express
    specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out how a trait depends
    on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for ETH, or you can rent
    it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot of ETH playing this game.
    Other players must have lost money if they invested in a collection while the
    market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with profit.The technical progress
    behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat is unique, with genes defined
    by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the owner’s address on the Ethereum
    blockchain. The game engine interprets the token and renders the smart contract’s
    computer code as a visible cat on the game’s website. When a player breeds two
    cats, a new token is minted by combining and updating the tokens referring to
    its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity in two ways: First, when a cat
    breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it can breed again. Each time it
    breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes a slower breeder. Second,
    later generations breed slower too. The most valuable cats have rare traits, are
    first-generation, and have bred little or not at all. Cats with normal genes,
    of later generations, and much offspring are so common that no one wants to buy
    them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game profile, just being cute.The
    company behind CryptoKitties used the features of the Ethereum blockchain to move
    computer gaming forward. They needed a robust platform for smart contracts, with
    a native and widely traded token—like ETH. Players no longer depend on the gaming
    company to steward their in-game assets, particularly, the cats. As tokens at
    an Ethereum address, players have full control over them. Transactions and breeding
    results are immutable. Although they still rely on the central game engine, which
    runs on the company’s servers, anyone could build a game engine that interprets
    the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats on a website.Representing in-game
    items as tokens gives rise to another possibility: developing a new game that
    repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any
    of your CryptoKitties against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty,
    and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding
    cats with features that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between
    the two games about the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats
    , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that
    a robust network effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build
    new decentralized games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is
    a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who
    handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial
    gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a
    crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold;
    they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding,
    collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the technology that makes
    it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many
    play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved
    that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!•    Digital tickets for events and travel.Non-fungible
    tokens introduce a new dimension of scarcity to the supply and demand of an asset.
    In the case of crypto-currency, its blockchain guarantees the rules that govern
    the issuance and transfer of the token. These public and verifiable rules ensure
    the scarcity of each of the units of the token. A non-fungible token relies on
    its blockchain to provide an additional guarantee: the token is X-of-a kind. There
    is a limited number of units of this token in circulation, where for most use
    cases, it is unique and refers to a single asset.The applications on non-fungible
    tokens I listed above are all promising. However, they each have unresolved issues.
    I am excited about the individual attempts of some existing projects, and I recommend
    these areas as sources of entrepreneurial opportunity.Besides financial applications,
    the area that is showing the most promise is online games. Gaming startups that

    goal was to collect, breed, and trade cartoon cats. The cats have genes that interact
    and can express specific traits. The challenge for the players is to figure out
    how a trait depends on which genes to breed rare cats. You can sell a cat for
    ETH, or you can rent it out for breeding. Some breeders have made quite a lot
    of ETH playing this game. Other players must have lost money if they invested
    in a collection while the market was peaking or failed to breed the kitties with
    profit.The technical progress behind the CryptoKitties -game is that each cat
    is unique, with genes defined by a smart contract, and ‘lives’ as a token at the
    owner’s address on the Ethereum blockchain. The game engine interprets the token
    and renders the smart contract’s computer code as a visible cat on the game’s
    website. When a player breeds two cats, a new token is minted by combining and
    updating the tokens referring to its parent tokens. The rules introduce scarcity
    in two ways: First, when a cat breeds, there is a cooling-off period before it
    can breed again. Each time it breeds, this period increases so that the cat becomes
    a slower breeder. Second, later generations breed slower too. The most valuable
    cats have rare traits, are first-generation, and have bred little or not at all.
    Cats with normal genes, of later generations, and much offspring are so common
    that no one wants to buy them. They sit at the player’s Ethereum address and game
    profile, just being cute.The company behind CryptoKitties used the features of
    the Ethereum blockchain to move computer gaming forward. They needed a robust
    platform for smart contracts, with a native and widely traded token—like ETH.
    Players no longer depend on the gaming company to steward their in-game assets,
    particularly, the cats. As tokens at an Ethereum address, players have full control
    over them. Transactions and breeding results are immutable. Although they still
    rely on the central game engine, which runs on the company’s servers, anyone could
    build a game engine that interprets the tokens and renders them as cartoon cats
    on a website.Representing in-game items as tokens gives rise to another possibility:
    developing a new game that repurposes pre-existing digital assets. For example,
    KittyRace lets you race any of your CryptoKitties against those of other players.
    You bet ETH on your kitty, and the winner takes the pot. These game mechanics
    led to some players breeding cats with features that made them good at winning
    races: a feedback loop between the two games about the same set of in-game assets.
    Another project is KittyHats , to outfit your cats with apparel and accessories.
    These projects suggest that a robust network effect will bring more players and
    developers, inspired to build new decentralized games that use the existing in-game
    assets.CryptoKitties is a proof of concept for rare digital in-game assets. Before
    this game, people who handled cryptocurrencies and tokens were motivated by technical
    innovation, financial gain, or political activism. CryptoKitties proved that people
    would transact a crypto-asset because it was collectible; Kitties are not always
    assets to be sold; they can be valuable and exciting for their own sake. Players
    can enjoy breeding, collecting, and trading cats, without any interest in the
    technology that makes it possible. Even though most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts,
    and many play for profit, they don’t have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong
    proved that computers could generate profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties
    showed that blockchains can run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were
    launched that use a blockchain to make the game elements scarce. For example,
    Gods Unchained is a strategy game with rare cards, which players can combine into
    even rarer cards. Just as with tradable cats, not every player has the same reason
    for playing. Some want to buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to
    combine and collect cards to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for
    cards is part of the game world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity
    is BeachHead 2020 , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person
    shooter in virtual reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy
    with scarce digital goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the
    aesthetic of cyberpunk warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just
    as it is in Hong Kong or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin
    to get the title deed to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy
    was an exciting challenge for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment
    platform suggests new types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial
    element blends the game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled
    into this phenomenon by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing
    games such as World of Warcraft became popular, a market grew for in-game items,
    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye

    in-game currency, and even whole characters. The virtual world Second Life also
    grew an economy of virtual goods. The economics of Fortnight show how players
    are willing to pay for purely aesthetic additions to their in-game character;
    virtual fashion is real.From the perspective of blockchain trades, these non-tokenized
    markets look clumsy. By having virtual items exist as tokens, they are much easier
    and safer to trade for currency. Furthermore, the possibility to take tokenized
    in-game assets into other games and virtual worlds means that game designers can
    catalyze feedback loops such as between CryptoKitties and KittyRace .Building
    the Next Phase of the EcosystemNon-fungible tokens inside of online games are
    only one area poised for hypergrowth. In 2020, Decentralized Finance is heating
    up, with many projects launching volatile tokens. In previous years, Ethereum
    was hosting projects that made everyday financial products transparent, expanding
    on traditional financial transactions such as borrowing and lending with collateral.
    Projects use the Ethereum blockchain to create new financial products and techniques,
    such as bonding curves and flash loans. Beyond the heated speculation, teams on
    the cutting edge can imagine new financial instruments that traditional players
    cannot dream up. Virtual jurisdictions empower the fast growth of new kinds of
    blockchain assets built by entrepreneurs. Liberated from the permission of financial
    authorities such as banks, they create products involving money and contracts,
    without the limits imposed by arbitrary third parties. These new companies make
    up a growing ecosystem of stakeholders, enjoying opportunities in a wide-open
    field. Eventually, this can lead to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    that take over the market for laws and agreements. They can host contracts and
    regulations on a global scale, free from geographical jurisdictions. Say goodbye
    to the hassles of banks and go-betweens!Representing in-game items as tokens gives
    rise to another possibility: developing a new game that repurposes pre-existing
    digital assets. For example, KittyRace lets you race any of your CryptoKitties
    against those of other players. You bet ETH on your kitty, and the winner takes
    the pot. These game mechanics led to some players breeding cats with features
    that made them good at winning races: a feedback loop between the two games about
    the same set of in-game assets. Another project is KittyHats , to outfit your
    cats with apparel and accessories. These projects suggest that a robust network
    effect will bring more players and developers, inspired to build new decentralized
    games that use the existing in-game assets.CryptoKitties is a proof of concept
    for rare digital in-game assets. Before this game, people who handled cryptocurrencies
    and tokens were motivated by technical innovation, financial gain, or political
    activism. CryptoKitties proved that people would transact a crypto-asset because
    it was collectible; Kitties are not always assets to be sold; they can be valuable
    and exciting for their own sake. Players can enjoy breeding, collecting, and trading
    cats, without any interest in the technology that makes it possible. Even though
    most of the players were crypto-enthusiasts, and many play for profit, they don’t
    have to. Just as Atari ’s popular game Pong proved that computers could generate
    profits as entertainment platforms, CryptoKitties showed that blockchains can
    run for fun.Since CryptoKitties , several games were launched that use a blockchain
    to make the game elements scarce. For example, Gods Unchained is a strategy game
    with rare cards, which players can combine into even rarer cards. Just as with
    tradable cats, not every player has the same reason for playing. Some want to
    buy rare cards to win matches, while others want to combine and collect cards
    to sell their tokens for profit. The marketplace for cards is part of the game
    world.Another game in the making that uses digital scarcity is BeachHead 2020
    , a project that I was part of. BeachHead 2020 is a first-person shooter in virtual
    reality that plans to grow into a full virtual reality economy with scarce digital
    goods, such as weapons, fashion, cars, and land. It has the aesthetic of cyberpunk
    warfare, and real estate in the city will be limited, just as it is in Hong Kong
    or Manhattan. Players will have to stake BeachHead coin to get the title deed
    to real estate. Designing the finer points of this economy was an exciting challenge
    for the team.The use of a blockchain as an entertainment platform suggests new
    types of games with rare and tradable assets. The financial element blends the
    game world with the real world. Traditional online games stumbled into this phenomenon
    by accident. When massive multiplayer online role-playing games such as World
