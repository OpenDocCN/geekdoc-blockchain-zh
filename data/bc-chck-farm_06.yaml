    but the urban villages (*chengzhongcun*, 城中村). These areas of the city exist as
    remarkable and unavoidable reminders of China’s urbanization project, and the
    never-ending process of building (and rebuilding). They thrive freely in big cities
    until the city government decides to eradicate them. During the winter of 2009,
    while Beijing’s urban villages still existed, I visited one that was adjacent
    to Yuan Ming Yuan, or the Old Summer Palace. It teemed with life, and poverty—kids
    playing badminton in the streets, piles of trash, stray dogs sniffing around,
    and hunks of meat hung to cure outside the entrance of a public restroom by someone
    taking advantage of scarce outdoor space. It was a rare affordable haven for migrants
    to the city who could not pay Beijing’s astronomical rents.

  zh: 贵阳“全面人口控制”的重点不是整个城市的人口，而是城中村。这些城市的地区是中国城市化项目的显著和不可避免的提醒，以及不断建设（和重建）的过程。它们在大城市中自由茁壮，直到城市政府决定根除它们。2009年冬天，当北京的城中村仍然存在时，我参观了一座毗邻圆明园的城中村。它充满了生机和贫困——孩子们在街上打羽毛球，垃圾堆放，流浪狗四处嗅探，某人趁机利用稀缺的户外空间，在公共卫生间入口处挂着肉块进行腌制。对于无法支付北京高昂房租的城市移民来说，这是一个罕见的负担得起的避风港。
- en: Urban villages help alleviate the housing burden on new migrants, yet they are
    disappearing in a phenomenon not specific to China—the push toward “making places
    nicer and safer.” *Chengzhongcun* directly translated means “village within the
    city,” and these form as Chinese cities expand into or start to surround neighboring
    farmland. Eventually, the land is cleared for new skyscrapers, and the government
    compensates the farmers with housing and money. In the best scenario, peasants
    can become well-off landlords in the new cityscape. In the worst case, they end
    up with compensation so low that they cannot buy a new home.

  zh: 城中村有助于减轻新移民的住房负担，但它们正在消失，这种现象并不局限于中国——这是对“让地方更美好和更安全”的推动。*Chengzhongcun* 直译是“城市中的村庄”，这些城中村是中国城市扩张到或开始围绕周边农田而形成的。最终，土地被清空以建造新的摩天大楼，政府会以房屋和金钱补偿农民。在最好的情况下，农民可以成为新城市天际线上富裕的房东。在最坏的情况下，他们得到的补偿太少，无法购买新房。
- en: Like China’s food and language, urban villages have an enormous amount of regional
    variation. What is common across all urban villages is that they are home to those
    on the fringes of city life—nannies, housekeepers, construction workers, delivery
    drivers. In Shenzhen, urban villages have played a key part in the city’s rise,
    nurturing new inventors with brash ideas and informal economies. Yet because of
    the socioeconomic status of the population residing in urban villages, these areas
    are deemed dangerous by upper-middle-class urbanites. The term that upper-middle-class
    Chinese people use to describe this population is “low-quality” (*disuzhi*, 低素质).
    Strangely, the upper-middle class seems to have no qualms about the low-quality
    population traveling to wealthier parts, watching over their children and cleaning
    their homes.

    低素质)这个词来描述这部分人口。奇怪的是，中上层似乎对低素质人口前往更富裕的地区、照顾他们的孩子和打扫家里并不畏惧。

    Not a foot, but an inch. I guess you just keep kicking!” Xiaoli adds that older

    100 fine, and being too early for a delivery is a whopping RMB 500 fine. Although
    the base salary initially seems appealing, the long list of fines creates a precarious
    existence for the workers. It parallels gig work in the United States—DoorDash
    drivers and TaskRabbits. In both cases, the larger system, the platform, off-loaded
    any operating risk to the workers, allowing the platform to shirk responsibility
    to customers. Through fee structures of bonuses, fines, and competition to be
    courier of the month, work is gamified, just like in the United States.
