- en: ConclusionWhen you’re learning something new it’s not advisable to jump in at
    the deep end. What you have here is a ten thousand foot view of JavaScript.Having
    a theoretical knowledge of it will always be beneficial to you and it’s something
    nobody can take away from you. Both theoretical and practical knowledge are important
    when learning how to code, but having purely practical knowledge can be limiting.
    You need to have an understanding of the concepts behind the code you’ve set out
    to learn. Problem solving while coding will come easily to you, because you will
    have an in-depth knowledge of how everything works from the bottom up.The software
    development field is constantly growing and changing, so knowing the fundamentals
    of JavaScript means that you will always be able to keep up with any updates.Whenever
    we say JavaScript is everywhere, we’re not just saying that, it is literally everywhere!
    It’s not just something we use on web browsers. It can also be used to program
    electronic toys, wifi connected coffee machines and mobile apps.According to the
    2021 StackOverflow developer survey, JavaScript is used by 94.5% of all websites.As
    far as career opportunities go, the possibilities are endless. The tech industry
    is always hiring and is one of the only career fields that is employee centric.
    They understand that employee satisfaction leads to productivity. You are constantly
    learning and also very likely to move up the ladder fairly quickly because there’s
    always room to grow.You can become a front-end, back-end or full stack developer.A
    front-end developer uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build websites from scratch.
    It’s an exciting job because every website is different, so the chances of doing
    the same thing everyday are slim. Front end developers need to ensure they are
    up to date with all the changes happening in the field, so if there is a downside
    it’s that they need to constantly do research.A back-end developer works on the
    server-side. Back end development is the management of the server and the database
    of any website. They create the environment that makes it possible for front-end
    development to exist.A full stack developer works on both the client-side and
    the server side. It’s like being in the middle. They are responsible for everything
    that happens when the front-end and back-end meet. Full stack developers can design
    software and then debug it as well. Full stack developers can work on small programming
    projects alone. Building a website for an individual can be done by one person.There
    is a big demand in the Job market for JavaScript developers because not all people
    who are employed in the tech industry have an in-depth knowledge of it. The average
    basic salary of a JavaScript developer in the United States is approximately $111,823
    per annum.There are a lot of self-taught JavaScript developers working today.

  zh: 结论当你学习新知识时，不建议一头扎进去。你现在所见的是 JavaScript 的一种全面的视角。理论知识对你永远都是有益的，并且是没有人能夺走的。在学习编程时，理论知识和实践知识都很重要，但只有纯粹的实践知识可能会有限制。你需要了解你要学习的代码背后的概念。因为你从底层开始就会对所有的工作原理有深入的了解，编码时解决问题变得容易。软件开发领域不断发展和变化，所以了解
    JavaScript 的基础知识意味着你将始终能跟上任何更新。每当我们说 JavaScript 无处不在，我们不是在说，它确实是无处不在！它不仅是我们在网页浏览器上使用的东西。它还可以用于编程电子玩具、wifi
    连接的咖啡机和手机应用程序。根据 2021 年 StackOverflow 开发者调查，JavaScript 被 94.5% 的所有网站使用。至于职业机会，可能性是无限的。科技行业一直在招聘，并且是唯一以员工为中心的职业领域之一。他们理解员工满意度导致生产力。你会不断学习，并且很可能会迅速晋升，因为总有成长的空间。你可以成为前端、后端或全栈开发人员。前端开发人员使用
    HTML、CSS 和 JavaScript 从头开始构建网站。这是一份令人兴奋的工作，因为每个网站都是不同的，所以每天做相同的事情的机会很小。前端开发人员需要确保自己了解领域中发生的所有变化，所以如果有不利之处，那就是他们需要不断进行研究。后端开发人员在服务器端工作。后端开发是管理任何网站的服务器和数据库。他们创建使前端开发成为可能的环境。全栈开发人员同时工作在客户端和服务器端。就像处于中间地带。他们负责前端和后端相遇时发生的一切。全栈开发人员可以设计软件，然后进行调试。全栈开发人员可以独自完成小型编程项目。一个人可以为个人建站。市场上对
    JavaScript 开发人员的需求量很大，因为并非所有在科技行业从业的人都对它有深入的了解。在美国，JavaScript 开发人员的平均基本工资约为每年
    $111,823。如今有很多自学的 JavaScript 开发人员在工作。通过时间、纪律和学习的意愿，你也可以成为其中之一！您的免费赠品您可以点击以下链接并加入我的邮件列表来获取您的副本。免费书籍
