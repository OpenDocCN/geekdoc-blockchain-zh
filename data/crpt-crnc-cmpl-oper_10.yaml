  zh: 加密货币投资尽职调查简介
- en: Due diligence is a broad term that encompasses a series of procedures through
    which investors can learn more about a potential investment. We will discuss these
    procedures in more detail in this chapter but on a high level they can range from
    simply asking basic questions about a potential investment’s characteristics,
    to very detailed forensic level analysis of particular aspects of an investment
    being considered. In a cryptocurrency context it should also be made clear that
    due diligence can be performed by investors on a wide variety of different crypto
    assets including direct investments in cryptocurrencies, non-fungible token (NFT)
    investments and allocations to cryptocurrency fund managers.

  zh: 操作性尽职调查
- en: The second category of due diligence is ***operational due diligence (ODD)***.
    ODD is the process of detecting and evaluating operational risk. Operational risk
    refers to, “the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes,
    people and systems, or from external events.”[¹](#FPar1) The term business risk
    is also sometimes utilized to refer to operational risk. Coming from the world
    of alternative investments, operational risk has turned into a broad catch-all
    category for LPs to bucket all other risks that do not directly relate to the
    investment function of a fund. It should be noted that while in practice, there
    is overlap between the analysis of operational risk and investment areas of fund
    manager however, this classification of risks into investment and operational
    buckets is still useful in order to guide an LP’s review toward the framework
    by which certain risks are analyzed. In the crypto space, this same broad operational
    risk definitional analysis framework is applied much the same way it is in the
    alternative investment space. Operational risk considerations in a crypto context
    can take on a wide variety of different forms. These are prevalent in both direct
    crypto investments as well as through investments in third-party crypto asset
    managers.

  zh: 尽职调查的第二个类别是***操作性尽职调查（ODD）***。操作性尽职调查是指检测和评估操作风险的过程。操作风险指的是，“因内部流程、人员和系统不足或失败，或因外部事件导致的损失风险。”[¹](#FPar1)
    业务风险有时也用来指代操作风险。来自另类投资世界的操作风险已经成为有限合伙人（LPs）将所有其他不直接关联基金投资功能的 risk 归入的广泛分类。需要注意的是，尽管在实践中，操作风险和投资领域的基金经理之间的分析存在重叠，但将风险分为投资和操作桶仍然有用，以指导有限合伙人（LPs）关注分析某些风险的框架。在加密领域，这种相同的广泛操作风险定义分析框架也以类似的方式应用于另类投资领域。在加密背景下的操作风险考虑可以采取各种各样的不同形式。这在直接加密投资以及通过投资第三方加密资产管理公司都非常普遍。

  zh: 加密货币的操作风险
- en: In a crypto context there can certainly be elements of operational risk associated
    with direct crypto and digital asset investments. For example, an investment in
    a particular cryptocurrency may have operational as a result of the underlying
    technology and blockchain protocols supporting the particular coin or token. For
    example, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV (BSV) suffered a 51% attack in August 2021
    which led to a significant price decline in BSV and an estimated drop in the hashrate
    of almost 50%.[²](#FPar1) This is an example of operational risk because the decline
    in BSV is not as a result of the investment merits of BSV itself but rather from
    operational factors underlying the cryptocurrency.

  zh: 在加密货币的背景下，确实存在与直接加密和数字资产投资相关的操作风险。例如，对特定加密货币的投资可能因支持该硬币或代币的底层技术和区块链协议而产生操作风险。例如，2021年8月，加密货币比特币SV（BSV）遭受了51%的攻击，导致BSV价格大幅下跌，哈希率估计下降了近50%。[²](#FPar1)
    这是操作风险的一个例子，因为BSV的下跌并不是因为BSV本身的投资价值，而是由于加密货币背后的操作因素。

  zh: 非同质化代币（NFT）的操作风险
- en: Operational risk is also prevalent in other digital assets such as investments
    in Non-Fungbile Tokens (NFT). An example of an NFT art situation in which operational
    risk played a role was the August 2021 launch of COVIDPunks based on the CryptoPunks
    NFT project. The COVIDPunks project featured, “*10,000 randomly-generated Punks on
    the Ethereum network. Each Punk is wearing a programmatically-assigned, W.H.O-approved mask,
    and has special pandemic-themed metadata that affects its background color and rarity*.”[³](#FPar1)
    When COVIDPunks launched users lost over 174 ETH, valued at approximately $490,000
    at the time, in failed transactions while trying to mint their own COVIDPunks
    NFTs.[⁴](#FPar1) Investors cannot recoup this money because Ethereum gas fees
    are non-refundable. These type of losses have nothing to do with the investment
    merit of the COVIDPunks but rather represent an operational risk of trying to
    make such an investment. Therefore, these could be classified as operational risk
    losses.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 操作风险也普遍存在于其他数字资产中，如对非同质化代币（NFT）的投资。一个在NFT艺术情况下操作风险发挥作用的示例是2021年8月基于CryptoPunks
    NFT项目的COVIDPunks的推出。COVIDPunks项目特色，“*10,000个随机生成的朋克在以太坊网络上。每个朋克都戴着程序分配的、世界卫生组织批准的口罩，并具有特殊的疫情主题元数据，影响其背景颜色和稀有性*。”[³](#FPar1)
    当COVIDPunks推出时，用户在尝试铸造自己的COVIDPunks NFT时失去了超过174 ETH，当时价值约49万美元的失败交易。[④](#FPar1)
    投资者无法收回这笔钱，因为以太坊手续费是不退还的。这些损失与COVIDPunks的投资优点无关，而是尝试进行此类投资的代表操作风险。因此，这些可以被归类为操作风险损失。
- en: Another NFT art-related example of operational risk relates to access the purchases
    of NFTs through marketplaces such as OpenSea. There have been many instances reported
    where an individual makes a purchase of an NFT but then finds they cannot access
    or view the artwork. In these types of cases the NFT itself remains in existence
    on the blockchain, typically Ethereum, but different platforms for can chose to
    no longer display access to it. This leads to a situation where a person cannot
    view the NFT they purchases. There are a variety of reasons this can occur including
    copyright violations, reusing stolen artwork and violations of a marketplace’s
    terms of usage.[⁵](#FPar1) Once again this type of situation represents NFT operational
    risk because there is an impact on the value, and even accessibility, of the digital
    investment for reasons outside of the pure investment merits of the NFTs.
  id: totrans-27

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 另一个与NFT艺术相关的操作风险示例与通过OpenSea等市场购买NFT的访问权限有关。据报道有许多案例，个人购买了NFT但却发现他们无法访问或查看艺术品。在这类情况下，NFT本身仍然存在于区块链上，通常是以太坊，但不同的平台可以选择不再显示对其的访问。这导致一个人无法查看他们购买的NFT。这种情况发生的原因有很多，包括版权侵犯、重新使用被盗艺术品和违反市场使用条款。[⁵](#FPar1)
    这种情况再次代表NFT操作风险，因为其价值，甚至可访问性，会因纯粹投资NFT的优点之外的诸多原因而受到影响。

    employee whose full time responsibility is vetting the operational risks at hedge
    fund managers.
  id: totrans-32
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 专注的 - 一个ODD框架，其中投资者的组织至少有一名全职员工负责审查对冲基金经理的操作风险。
- en: Shared - An operational due diligence approach under which the responsibility
    for reviewing the operational risk at a crypto fund is shared by the same individuals
    who have responsibility for investment due diligence, and there are not any dedicated
    ODD resources.
  id: totrans-33
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 共享 - 在共享型运营尽职调查方法下，对加密货币基金运营风险的审查责任由负责投资尽职调查的同一人员承担，且没有专用的 ODD 资源。
- en: Modular – Under a modular framework the ODD process is classified into functional
    components. These individual components are then spread out among individuals
    throughout the investors organization each of which has unique domain-specific
    knowledge. It is important to note that in a modular operational due diligence
    framework, these domain experts typically have other responsibilities within the
    larger investment organization that reach outside of the ODD work. An example
    of this would be an investment allocation organization with a Chief Technology
    Officer (CTO) or Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In a modular ODD framework, the
    work of these domain experts is often pieced together by an individual or group
    of individuals which we will refer to as an ***operational generalist***. The
    operational generalist can be thought of as an information aggregator who pieces
    together the disparate functional reviews completed by the domain experts to facilitate
    the LP organizations progressing toward arriving at an ***operational risk conclusion***.
    The operational due diligence duties of the operational generalist can be very
    similar to those of operational due diligence analysts under a dedicated framework
    and can include such things as on-site manager visits and operational risk report
    generation. Under a modular framework the operational generalist or group of individuals
    performing the operational generalist function can either be a dedicated operational
    due diligence professional (i.e. - fitting into the definition of the dedicated
    approach) or the operational generalist(s) themselves can serve other functions
    within the organization and may even be domain expert(s) in their own right. An
    example of this would be a COO who has other responsibilities within the LP’s
    organization, yet who also serves as the operational generalist piecing together
    the operational due diligence work of the functional domain experts.

  zh: 模块化 - 在模块化框架下，ODD 过程被划分为功能组件。这些单独的组件然后分散给投资者组织中的各个个体，每个个体都拥有独特的领域特定知识。需要注意的是，在模块化运营尽职调查框架下，这些领域专家通常在其他更大的投资组织中有其他职责，这些职责超出
    ODD 工作范围。一个例子是拥有首席技术官（CTO）或首席财务官（CFO）的投资分配组织。在模块化 ODD 框架下，这些领域专家的工作通常由一个人或一组人拼凑在一起，我们称他们为**运营通才**。运营通才可以被看作是信息聚合者，他们拼凑领域专家完成的各个功能性审查，以促进
    LP 组织朝着得出**运营风险结论**的方向进展。运营通才的运营尽职调查职责与专用框架下的运营尽职调查分析师的职责非常相似，可能包括诸如现场经理访问和运营风险报告生成等事物。在模块化框架下，承担运营通才职能的个人或一组人可以是专门的运营尽职调查专业人士（即符合专用方法的定义）或者运营通才本身可以在组织内担任其他职能，甚至可能是他们自己的领域专家。一个例子是
    COO，他在 LP 的组织中有其他职责，同时作为运营通才拼凑功能领域专家的运营尽职调查工作。
- en: Hybrid - A hybrid ODD approach encompasses some combination of the three previously
    described approaches (dedicated, shared, modular). An example of a hybrid framework
    would be an LP’s organization that would have a full time ODD analyst (i.e. -
    dedicated framework) while leveraging off other in-house domain experts as needed.
    Continuing this example, these domain experts would not be a part of the standard
    operational due diligence review process followed by the LP (i.e. - such as a
    modular approach) but utilized on an ad-hoc basis. Another example of an operational
    due diligence framework which would befall under the hybrid classification would
    be an LP that outsources the operational due diligence function, either in part
    or entirely, to a third-party operational risk consultant.

  zh: 混合 - 混合型 ODD 方法包括了之前描述的三种方法的某些组合（专用、共享、模块化）。一个混合框架的例子是某个 LP 的组织，该组织有一个全职的 ODD
    分析师（即专用框架）同时根据需要利用其他内部领域专家。继续这个例子，这些领域专家不会参与 LP 遵循的标准运营尽职调查审查过程（即模块化方法），而是根据需要进行利用。另一个属于混合分类的运营尽职调查框架的例子是某个
    LP 将运营尽职调查功能部分或全部外包给第三方运营风险顾问。

    managers, is related to a concept known as an ***operational veto***. When an
    operational veto is executed, this means that an investor, or the appropriate
    decision mechanisms such as an investment committee, has decided that they will
    not be allocated to a crypto asset manager primarily on the basis of operational
    risk considerations present. The way operational vetos can be distinguished from
    ODD frameworks, is that these different ODD models do not address which individuals
    or groups at an LP’s organization hold the authority to make the ultimate operational
    conclusion regarding a particular crypto asset manager. Furthermore, these style
    buckets do not address which individuals or groups, such as an investment committee,
    has the final authority to make the final allocation decision to a crypto asset
    manager.

    of the legal documents which some may assume obviates the need for a secondary
    investor ODD review. In practice however, the purpose of these two reviews are
    generally different in nature. The lawyer reviewing the legal docs related to
    the investors proposed investment in the crypto fund is doing so focused primarily
    through the lens of legality. For example, the lawyer reviewing the crypto fund
    documentation is attempting to determine if there is anything in the fund docs
    which would be a potential violation of law, or something that would violate the
    investors fiduciary obligations.

- en: A secondary purpose of the lawyers review is focused on negotiation. In this
    instance, the lawyer is trying to determine if there are any terms in the fund
    offering documents that should be negotiated to be more advantageous to their
    client, the potential investor in the crypto fund. Some examples of the types
    of items that investors commonly seek to negotiate with crypto fund managers can
    include fund performance and management fees, notification provisions for specific
    investment-related limits that may be of concern to a particular investor, investment
    level transparency and reporting provisions and key person provisions.

    the same documentation conducted by an investor during ODD in that the focus of

    associated considerations as outlined in the documentation. While an ODD review
    may overlap with the lawyers review in terms of general assessments of legality
    and negotiation, this is not the focus. For example, let us consider if a crypto
    asset manager’s legal documentation does not provide for a key person clause.
    A key person clause typically allows for investors to make redemptions of capital
    without penalty and during periods when they would otherwise not normally be allowed
    to because the portfolio manager of the fund or other key personnel, have become
    uninvolved in the fund through a prolonged absence such as a severe incapacitating
    illness. It is not illegal for a crypto asset manager not to have a key person
    clause, but it is certainly considered advantageous to investors for such a clause
    to be present. As such, the ODD review may raise this issue where the legal review
    might otherwise not have.

    pervasive skepticism surrounding the security and reputation of crypto related
    investments. Many of these concerns are rooted in the traditionally black cloud
    that has hung over the crypto space where the use of crypto assets such as Bitcoin
    has been thought of to be primarily utilized by criminals on dark web portals
    such as Silk Road to conduct criminal activity. Recent studies have shown that
    these associations continue to over represent the criminal ways in which cryptocurrencies
    are utilized.[⁶](#FPar1) As an example, a series of studies conducted by Chainalysis
    showed that in 2019 criminal activity represented only 2.1% of all cryptocurrency
    transaction volume, or approximately $21.4 billion in transaction volume. In 2021,
    a revised Chainalysis study showed that this number has continued to decrease

    例如，Chainalysis进行的一系列研究显示，2019年犯罪活动仅占所有加密货币交易量的2.1%，大约为214亿美元交易量。2021年，Chainalysis的一项修订研究显示，这一数字仍在下降，加密货币活动的犯罪份额下降至仅0.34%，大约为100亿美元交易量。[⁷](#FPar1)

    and criminal activity involves the use of crypto in ransomware payments. Ransomware
    attacks are common cybersecurity attacks where criminals install software on a

    ransom is paid. Due to the speed and anonymity associated with cryptocurrencies
    increasingly cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are the ways in which the criminals
    require payment for their ransom. A May 2021 ransomware attack by the criminal
    organization the DarkSide group on Colonial Pipeline caused damage to America’s
    supply of gas and resulted in the payment of nearly $5 million in cryptocurrency
    to the group to unlock the compromised systems.[⁸](#FPar1) These types of attacks

    that would require banks, exchanges and other dealing in cryptocurrencies to undertake
    enhanced compliance measures to better verify the identities of individuals attempting
    to withdraw or resend cryptocurrencies, with a particular focus on unhosted wallets.[⁹](#FPar1)

    diligence should not be interpreted to imply that there is necessarily cause for

    these other areas are demonstrating that they are taking a prudent approach toward

    their background and does not have any potentially damaging reputational surprises
    they are hiding. By performing these types of enhanced ODD and investigative checks,
    investors ultimately have more conviction in their investments. This results in

    investors spend more time upfront on due diligence, then once they make an investment,
    they are less likely to redeem their capital very quickly and hence the capital

    A crypto asset manager may be involved in litigation as part of normal course

    One way combining the ODD and investigative due diligence processes can provide
    due diligence efficiencies is if investors need clarification regarding this type
    of litigation and to help better distinguish whether or not a particular legal
    action for example, may be negative in nature. During operational due diligence
    LPs are dealing directly with the crypto asset manager directly. This ODD and
    investigative due diligence process integration removes the need to re-approach
    crypto GP's for background investigation issues. Additionally, as outlined above,
    another benefit is that an LP who is more familiar with the operations and activities

  zh: 在投资者尽职调查期间考虑加密托管问题
- en: A key area that investors have devoted increased due diligence resources to
    in the crypto space is in the areas of custody. *The* *term* ***custody*** refers
    to the process by which crypto assets are stored in a secure and documentable
    manner. When the cryptocurrency industry was first getting started, a large number
    of crypto investors held self-custody of assets in cold wallets such as on their
    personal computers or on portable hard drive type wallets. The motivation for
    this was largely due to the belief that crypto investments should support the
    decentralization of financial services. These types of solutions were not very
    secure solutions in the sense that an individual’s home computer is susceptible
    to failure or being hacked. Furthermore, cold storage wallets may be lost or stolen.

  zh: 投资者在加密领域加大了尽职调查资源投入的关键领域之一是保管领域。*保管* *术语* ***custody*** 指的是以安全且可文档化方式存储加密货币资产的过程。加密货币行业最初起步时，许多加密投资者选择在自己个人电脑或便携式硬盘钱包中自行保管资产。这一动机主要是基于支持金融服务去中心化的信念。这种解决方案在安全性上并不理想，因为个人的家用电脑可能遭遇故障或被黑客攻击。此外，冷存储钱包可能遗失或被盗。
- en: Additionally, there can be a simple case of where a user misplaces or simply
    forgets the password to their wallet. This risk eventually led to the development
    of pneumonic seed phrases so that users could utilize these phrases in an attempt
    to allow them to remember their passwords but once again this is not a fool proof
    system. For all of these reasons, institutional investors are increasingly skeptical
    of self-custody solutions. An alternative to self-custody is for a crypto fund
    manager to employ a hybrid solution that is sometimes referred to as a wallet
    plus solution. These types of wallet plus arrangements involve the use of hardware
    wallets but with additional security measures layered on top of them. Examples
    of these additional security measures could include two-factor authentication
    protocols as well as the requirement for multiple signatories, as administered
    by a third party, prior to any transactions occurring in the wallet.

  zh: 另外，用户可能会简单地将钱包密码放错地方或干脆忘记。这种风险最终促使开发了助记词（pneumonic seed phrases），以便用户尝试利用这些词来记住他们的密码，但再一次，这并不是一个万无一失的系统。出于这些原因，机构投资者越来越对自行保管解决方案持怀疑态度。自行保管的替代方案是加密基金管理人采用混合解决方案，有时被称为钱包加解决方案。这类钱包加安排涉及使用硬件钱包，但在其上增加了额外的安全措施。这些额外安全措施可能包括双因素认证协议以及要求多个签名，由第三方管理，在进行钱包中的任何交易之前。
- en: Another type of custody model that can be employed by crypto fund managers is
    an entirely third-party custody solution. Third-party custody models are well
    established for other alternative investment vehicles such as non-crypto hedge
    funds and private equity funds. Hedge funds that are increasingly investing in
    the crypto space have embraced the traditional third-party custody model for crypto
    assets with over 52% of crypto hedge funds employing a third-party custodian as
    of 2019, and anecdotal evidence suggest this number has steadily increased as
    more institutional LPs have focused on crypto asset custody during the ODD process.[^(12)](#FPar1)
    For reference custody and the role of custodians is discussed in more detail in
    Chapter [3](513667_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml).

  zh: 另一种加密基金管理人可以采用的保管模型是完全的第三方保管解决方案。第三方保管模型在其他替代投资工具，如非加密货币对冲基金和私募股权基金方面已经非常成熟。越来越多投资加密货币的对冲基金接受了传统的第三方保管模型，截至2019年，超过52%的加密货币对冲基金聘请了第三方保管人，而据
    anecdotal evidence 显示，随着越来越多的机构有限合伙人（LPs）在 ODD 过程中关注加密货币资产保管，这一数字呈现出稳步增长趋势。[^(12)](#FPar1)
    参考第 [3](513667_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml) 章关于参考保管和保管人的角色讨论得更为详细。
- en: These third-party custody solutions have increasingly been made easier to implement
    through the use of linked custody solutions by crypto exchanges such as Gemini
    and CoinBase. These crypto exchanges already can provide investors with web-based
    hot wallet solutions. These hot wallets allow for the storage of coins owned by
    crypto funds at wallets hosted by the exchange. This would be as opposed to purely
    cold wallet storage. Third-party custodian models meet the more traditional established
    standards of non-crypto hedge fund and private equity institutional level custody.
    Due to the enhanced risks of hacks allowing for the virtually anonymous stealing
    of crypto assets once they are transferred to new wallets, crypto third-party
    custody solutions are increasingly mirroring the security measures employed by
    offsite business continuity and disaster recovery sites utilized by hedge funds.
    These types of hardened facilities allow crypto fund managers to store the physical
    keys to the cryptocurrencies and digital assets, often with a high level of security.
    The hardware devices utilized to maintain crypto keys and wallets are often highly
    specialized security devices such as hardware security modules (HSMs) the most
    secure of which are subject to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
    security ratings.[^(13)](#FPar1)

  zh: 这些第三方保管解决方案越来越多地通过加密货币交易所（如Gemini和CoinBase）使用的链接保管解决方案而变得更容易实施。这些加密货币交易所已经可以为投资者提供基于网页的热钱包解决方案。这些热钱包允许将加密货币基金持有的硬币存储在交易所托管的钱包中。这与纯粹的冷钱包存储相对。第三方保管人模型符合更加传统和成熟的非加密货币对冲基金和私人股权机构级别的保管标准。由于黑客攻击的风险增加，允许一旦加密资产转移到新钱包就几乎匿名地窃取，因此加密货币的第三方保管解决方案越来越多地模仿对冲基金使用的离线业务连续性和灾难恢复站点所采用的安全措施。这些类型的加固设施允许加密货币基金经理存储加密货币和数字资产的物理密钥，通常具有很高的安全级别。用于维护加密密钥和钱包的硬件设备通常是高度专业化的安全设备，如硬件安全模块（HSMs），其中最安全的是符合联邦信息处理标准（FIPS）安全评级的。[^(13)](#FPar1)

    crypto universe in spaces such as DeFi, pure self-custody and quasi self-custody
    solutions may still be utilized by crypto asset managers due to a lack of support
    for newer or evolving DeFi projects and related coins. In these types of situations
    investor due diligence becomes increasingly important. This is in large part due
    to the fact that once the current custody solution employed by the crypto fund
    manager is analyzed and the risk level diagnosed, then the investors can work
    in a consultative manner with the crypto asset manager to determine if any alternative
    custody arrangements are available which would still facilitate the fund manager’s
    investment process while minimizing the investor’s operational risk exposure in
    the area of custody risk.

  zh: 除了对加密货币本身的投资外，在其他加密宇宙空间（如DeFi）中，由于缺乏对新兴或发展中的DeFi项目和相关代币的支持，纯自我保管和准自我保管解决方案可能仍然会被加密资产管理者所使用。在这种情况下，投资者的尽职调查变得越来越重要。这在很大程度上是因为，一旦分析了加密基金经理当前的保管解决方案并诊断出风险水平，那么投资者就可以与加密资产管理者以咨询方式合作，确定是否还有其他可用的保管安排，这些安排既能便利基金经理的投资过程，又能最小化投资者在保管风险领域的操作风险暴露。

    categories of crypto due diligence on a crypto asset manager: investment, operational
    and investigative. As part of this discussion, we discussed common areas covered
    during the investment due diligence process including analyzing crypto investment
    strategy and fund risk statistics. Next, we turned to a review of the common goal
    of the operational due diligence (ODD) process that includes unique considerations
    applicable to both cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We also discussed
    common operational due diligence models employed by investors in crypto funds
    and the items typically covered during a crypto ODD review. Next, we discussed
    the investigative due diligence process as well as the increasing trend of combining
    the operational and investigative due diligence processes. We concluded the chapter
    by discussing unique consideration for cryptocurrency custody solutions during
    the due diligence process.'
