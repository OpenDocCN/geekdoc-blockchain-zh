- en: Our motivation for writing this book is to provide a broad-based and accessible
    introduction to three of the presently most important areas of computational finance,
    namely, option pricing, algorithmic trading and blockchain. To the best of our
    knowledge, no other book in the market provides such a coverage. It is our hope
    that the book will be useful to senior undergraduates, graduates and MBA students,
    as well as researchers and practitioners. In its first part, the book reflects
    option pricing in different frameworks. A simple treatment of assessment of cash
    flows and fixed security derivatives is also presented. Finally, the problem of
    asset ranking is addressed in this part of the book. In a broad sense, the second
    part of the book covers algorithmic issues related to finance. The first three
    chapters of the second part addresses some computational issues related to the
    theory discussed in the first part. The rest of the second part, consisting of
    five chapters, discusses approaches for algorithmic trading, portfolio optimisation
    and risk management. The third part of the book is devoted to blockchain and cryptocurrency.
    A fairly detailed introduction to both of these topics is presented along with
    various applications of blockchain to financial and other applications. The wide
    coverage of the book and its authentic and well-expressive presentation make the
    book quite up-to-date from both theoretical and practical sides, and highly reactive
    to the problems of recent concern. We believe that in satisfying its objectives,
    our book offers a unique perspective to contemporary aspects of finance in a lucid
    manner for senior undergraduates, graduates, MBA students and regulators. Further,
    the book can serve as a useful reference for basic theory to practitioners in
    the area. Much of finance today involves a fair amount of mathematics. In the
    book, we have tried to find a balance between having too much and too little mathematics.
    Detailed mathematical derivations have been given in some cases, helpful aids
    have been provided in some other cases so that a reader can complete the derivations,
    and for cases where the proofs takes us too far away from the discussion at hand,
    the proofs have been omitted. In our opinion, the first two parts of the book
    can be understood by somebody having a college-level introduction to calculus,
    linear algebra, probability and statistics. The mathematical requirement for the
    third part is markedly different from that of the first two parts. It is due to
    this reason we have tried to keep the mathematical description of the third part
    to a bare minimum. Several chapters of the book have been used for offering a
    course on the theory of finance to Master of Science in Quantitative Economics
    students at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, in the Fall Semester
    of 2019\. The materials were well received by the students. We express our sincere
    gratitude to the students for their enthusiasm and helpful comments in the process
    of direct interactions. We thank Pinaki Sarkar for providing several suggestions
    to improve the coverage of the book. We also thank Sanjay Bhattacherjee for reading
    and commenting on some chapters of the third part.

  zh: 我们撰写这本书的动机是为了提供一个广泛而易于理解的介绍，涵盖了计算金融目前最重要的三个领域，即期权定价、算法交易和区块链。据我们所知，市场上没有其他书籍提供这样的覆盖范围。我们希望这本书对大四学生、研究生、MBA学生以及研究人员和从业者都有所帮助。在第一部分中，本书反映了不同框架下的期权定价。还介绍了对现金流和固定证券衍生物的评估的简单处理。最后，本书的这一部分解决了资产排名的问题。从广义上讲，本书的第二部分涵盖了与金融相关的算法问题。第二部分的前三章讨论了与第一部分讨论的理论相关的一些计算问题。第二部分的其余部分，包括五章，讨论了算法交易、投资组合优化和风险管理的方法。本书的第三部分专门讨论了区块链和加密货币。与这两个主题相关的相当详细的介绍以及区块链在金融和其他领域的各种应用也被提出。本书的广泛覆盖和其真实而富有表现力的呈现使其在理论和实践两方面都非常及时，并且对近期关注的问题高度反应灵敏。我们相信，在满足其目标方面，我们的书以清晰的方式为大四学生、研究生、MBA学生和监管机构提供了对金融当代方面的独特视角。此外，本书可以作为从业者在该领域的基本理论的有用参考。今天的许多金融活动都涉及相当数量的数学。在本书中，我们试图在数学过多和过少之间取得平衡。在某些情况下，给出了详细的数学推导，在其他情况下，提供了有助于读者完成推导的帮助性信息，而在证明使我们远离讨论的情况下，已省略了证明。在我们看来，本书的前两部分可以被有着大学级微积分、线性代数、概率论和统计学介绍的人理解。第三部分的数学要求与前两部分明显不同。正因为这个原因，我们试图将第三部分的数学描述保持在最低限度。本书的若干章节已被用于在印度斯塔蒂斯蒂克斯研究所，印度加尔各答，2019年秋季学期向量经济学硕士学生提供金融理论课程。学生们对这些材料的反响很好。我们要向学生们表达诚挚的感谢，感谢他们在直接互动过程中的热情和有益的评论。我们感谢Pinaki
    Sarkar提出了许多改进本书覆盖范围的建议。我们还要感谢Sanjay Bhattacherjee阅读和评论了第三部分的一些章节。
