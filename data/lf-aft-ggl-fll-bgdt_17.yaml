- en: When Stephen Balaban proposed to Betty Meng, the skies above blessed the event
    with a giant diamond ring. He had first glimpsed her across a crowded room at
    Oren’s Hummus Shop on University Avenue in Palo Alto four years earlier. Now,
    on the morning of August 21, 2017, the two were standing in Madras, Oregon, at
    an optimal point in the seventy-mile-wide “path of totality” of the solar eclipse.

  zh: 当斯蒂芬·巴拉班向贝蒂·孟求婚时，天空上方用一颗巨大的钻石戒指祝福了这一事件。四年前的一天，他在帕洛阿尔托大学大道的奥伦鹰嘴豆店里的拥挤房间里第一次瞥见了她。现在，2017年8月21日的早晨，两人站在俄勒冈州的马德拉斯，处于太阳食的七十英里宽的“全食带”的最佳位置。
- en: The winter stars came out. An eclipse wind chilled the air. Two minutes and
    four seconds of daytime darkness passed. Eerie bands of shadow shimmered on the
    ground. Then, at exactly 10:29 a.m., the sun signaled its return. The expected
    diamond of sunlight burst out from behind the moon, and Stephen presented his
    girlfriend with a terrestrial version. The awed Betty said yes.

  zh: 冬季星星闪耀着光芒。一阵风使空气变冷。白天的黑暗持续了两分零四秒。诡异的阴影条带在地面上闪烁。然后，在上午10:29准时，太阳发出了它的回归信号。预期的太阳光钻石从月球背后爆发出来，斯蒂芬向女友呈上了一颗地球版。惊叹不已的贝蒂说了是的。
- en: 'As Peter Thiel writes in Zero to One, “every great entrepreneur is first and
    foremost a designer. . . . ”[¹](notes.html#ch17note-1) But the designs do not
    always work on the first try. Balaban had bought that diamond ring on the crest
    of a sudden, unexpected, and growing wave of business success doing something
    no one, including himself, expected him to do: beat Google and Amazon at one of
    their own games. But a crucible of deep learning preceded this triumphal proposal
    scene.'

- en: Fluent in Mandarin, Balaban went to Beijing in 2010 as a college senior, taking
    a semester off from studying computer science and economics at the University
    of Michigan. In China, he helped found “a clone,” as he describes it, of the Y-Combinator
    startup accelerator. He named it for Yuan Fen, the Chinese concept of the fate
    that brings people together. He had the educational experience of eventually watching
    the venture fizzle because of conflicts among the founders.

  zh: 巴拉班精通普通话，在2010年作为密歇根大学计算机科学和经济学学生休学一学期后，他去了北京。在中国，他帮助创办了一个“克隆”，正如他所描述的，是Y-Combinator初创企业加速器的克隆。他将其命名为“缘分”，即中国人认为的那种将人们联系在一起的命运概念。最终，由于创始人之间的冲突，他有了看着这个创业项目失败的教育经历。
- en: Returning to Michigan, he took his degree and headed for Silicon Valley—after
    Beijing, “the real deal.” He moved into a room in San Francisco’s historic Chinatown
    with its own sink and a shared bathroom down the hall, an hour by bicycle and
    Caltrain from Palo Alto. It was April 2012, and Balaban was starting a company
    to teach machines to see and learn, working on face recognition for mobile devices.
    He gave this company a Greek rather than a Chinese name—Lambda Labs—after Alonzo
    Church’s universal model of computation, an American version of a Turing machine.

  zh: 返回密歇根州后，他拿到了学位，然后前往硅谷——在北京之后，这才是“真正的交易”。他搬进了旧金山历史悠久的唐人街的一间房间，房间里有自己的洗手池，走廊上有一个共用的浴室，骑自行车和坐
    Caltrain 到帕洛阿尔托需要一个小时。那是 2012 年 4 月，巴拉班开始了一家公司，教会机器看和学，致力于移动设备的人脸识别。他给这家公司起了一个希腊名字而不是一个中文名字——Lambda
    Labs——以阿隆佐·丘奇的通用计算模型命名，这是图灵机的美国版本。
- en: In 2012, people knew that face recognition was coming to handsets, but no one
    had been able to make it compact and fast enough. Balaban’s work caught the attention
    of the academic image gurus Zak Stone and Nicolas Pinto at Perceptio Corporation,
    and they hired him in November to develop mobile face recognition technology for
    the iPhone.

  zh: 2012 年，人们知道人脸识别即将进入手机，但没有人能够将其变得紧凑和快速。巴拉班的工作引起了感知公司的学术形象专家扎克·斯通和尼古拉斯·平托的注意，他们于
    11 月雇佣他开发 iPhone 的移动人脸识别技术。
- en: Like all such projects by then, this one would be based on deep neural-network
    processing. But it was mobile machine learning, Balaban explains, “meaning running
    face recognition and other neural nets on the phone’s own graphics processing
    unit, not even uploading to the sky.” He saw that artificial intelligence did
    not need to take place in giant data warehouses. This was a contrarian insight
    worthy of a Thiel Fellow (and by mid-2013 he was living with two of them, Austin
    Russell and Thomas Sohmers), but it took some years before he capitalized on it.
    “Basically I was learning deep learning.”

  zh: 像那时的所有类似项目一样，这个项目将基于深度神经网络处理。但这是移动机器学习，巴拉班解释说，“意味着在手机的图形处理单元上运行人脸识别和其他神经网络，甚至不上传到云端。”他发现人工智能不需要在巨大的数据仓库中进行。这是一个与众不同的洞见，值得一个蒂尔基金会的研究员（到
    2013 年中期，他与两位蒂尔基金会的研究员奥斯汀·拉塞尔和托马斯·索默斯一起生活），但他花了一些年才能利用它。“基本上我在学习深度学习。”
- en: He left Perceptio in November 2013\. Two years later, Stone and Pinto sold the
    company to Apple for $200 million. Its face-recognition functions are now standard
    in new iPhones. Meanwhile, Balaban lured his fraternal twin brother, Michael,
    away from the growing success story NextDoor, which provides localized information
    and services, to be chief technology officer of Lambda Labs. Michael seems to
    have shared his twin’s impeccable timing—by 2015, NextDoor had become a unicorn
    worth more than a billion dollars.

  zh: 他于 2013 年 11 月离开了 Perceptio。两年后，斯通和平托将公司以 2 亿美元的价格卖给了苹果。其人脸识别功能现在已成为新 iPhone
    的标准功能。与此同时，巴拉班将他的孪生兄弟迈克尔从不断增长的成功故事 NextDoor 中挖走，NextDoor 提供本地化信息和服务，让他成为 Lambda
    Labs 的首席技术官。迈克尔似乎也有着与孪生兄弟一样的完美时机——到了 2015 年，NextDoor 已经成为价值超过十亿美元的独角兽。
- en: The Balabans started working on hardware. Using portable AI and face recognition,
    they conceived a wearable camera embedded in a baseball cap, resembling Google
    Glass or Snapchat spectacles. The problem was that no one in Silicon Valley could
    build the “Lambda Hat” prototypes, so Stephen was back in China for six months
    of exploring the manufacturing hives of Shenzhen, across the bay from Hong Kong.
    He ended up with a cool hat, better Mandarin, and a sharper sales pitch but no
    manufacturer or market for the product. “The technology was not mature,” Stephen
    decided.

    帽”的原型，因此斯蒂芬又回到中国，在深圳这个与香港隔海相望的制造业中心进行了为期六个月的探索。他得到了一顶很酷的帽子，更好的普通话口语，以及更加犀利的销售陈述，但产品却没有制造商或市场。“技术还不成熟，”
    斯蒂芬决定说。
- en: Despite the disappointment, he still did not want to work on “something that
    wasn’t mine.” In early 2015, Gary Bradski—the robotics pioneer who developed computer
    vision at Intel, founded the Willow Garage robotics incubator, which convinced
    Wired’s Kevin Kelly that “robots have wants,” and started Industrial Perception,
    which made “stevedore robots” that could, as Stephen Balaban described it, “pick
    up and chuck a box so elegantly” that Google bought them—that Gary Bradski—invited
    Balaban to join his deep-learning team at Magic Leap. Launched in 2010, the Google-funded
    virtual reality venture in Florida had heretofore raised half a billion dollars
    while generating more national magazine covers than virtual reality advances.
    Neal Stephenson had just joined the company (as chief futurist), but Balaban wasn’t
    convinced, however magic and well-funded the leap.

    Gary Bradski——邀请巴拉班加入他在 Magic Leap 的深度学习团队。这家总部位于佛罗里达的由谷歌资助的虚拟现实公司于 2010 年推出，此前已筹集了五亿美元，而国内的杂志封面上却比虚拟现实的进展更多。尽管如此，尼尔·斯蒂芬森刚刚加入了公司（担任首席未来学家），但巴拉班并不信服，无论这个跳跃多么神奇和资金充裕。

    $2 million to tape-out Sohmers’s new chip at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing

- en: To Balaban, the code and its results were a visual confirmation of what Yoshua
    Bengio, a colleague of Geoffrey Hinton in the Montreal crucible of AI, calls the
    “manifold learning hypothesis.” Bengio sees the essential job of a neural network
    as learning a hierarchy of representations in which each new layer is built up
    out of representations resolved in a previous layer. The machine begins with raw
    pixels and combines them into lines and curves transitioning from dark to light
    and then into geometrical shapes, which finally can be encoded into elements of
    human faces or other targeted figures. Scramble this process at an early stage
    and you get an artfully inflected picture; scramble it higher up in the hierarchy
    and you get a phantasia of “dream and nightmare” images, as Bengio puts it. In
    dreams and nightmares, as in machine-learning feedback loops, no new information
    is perceived. Without new inputs, the mind or machine churns the old images in
    intriguing but unresolved patterns.[³](notes.html#ch17note-3)

  zh: 对 Balaban 来说，这段代码及其结果是对蒙特利尔人工智能熔炉中 Geoffrey Hinton 的同事 Yoshua Bengio 所称的“流形学习假设”的视觉确认。Bengio
    认为神经网络的基本任务是学习一种表示的层次结构，其中每个新层都是从前一层解析出的表示构建起来的。机器从原始像素开始，将它们组合成从暗到亮的线条和曲线，然后转变为几何形状，最终可以编码为人脸或其他目标图形的元素。在早期阶段打乱这个过程，你会得到一幅技艺高超的图片；在层次结构较高的地方打乱它，你会得到一幅“梦幻与噩梦”图像的幻象，正如
    Bengio 所说。在梦境和噩梦中，就像在机器学习的反馈循环中一样，没有感知到新的信息。没有新的输入，心智或机器会以引人入胜但无解决的模式搅动旧图像。

    time, as Danielle Strachman stresses, that the power of an entrepreneurial community

    when he first encountered them: “Mike and Danielle recognize the emotional component
    of starting a company that a lot of people neglect—the emotional rollercoaster

    He simply couldn’t do it. It was a “Zero to One” moment, defying the most settled

    to compete with Amazon and Google by building infrastructure. This consensus was
    powerfully confirmed by two of the greatest success stories of the past decade,
    Netflix and Instagram, both of which scaled up to a valuation of scores of billions

    to build his own servers from scratch, influenced, perhaps, by Thomas Sohmers’s
    insight that present-day servers are kludges that waste 98 percent of their energy
    running data over wires to and from memory or sitting around in “wait states.”
    Balaban decided he had spent enough time and money on wait states. There had to
    be a better way than sending off terabytes of learning data over the Internet
    to a queue at the Amazon GPU farm. “It would be cheaper and faster,” he calculated,

    Point-32 performance teraflops of 10.6\. The gaming chips (GeForce GTX 1080 TI)
    produced 11.3 teraflops and could be bought for $580 per module. It was not a

  zh: 那时，巴拉班发现了一个令人失望的事实，即Nvidia并未以他所需的微不足道的数量出售其GeForce GPU板卡用于他的服务器群。这看起来像是一个“阻碍”。但是他想起了与奥斯汀·拉塞尔关于为加密挖矿构建游戏板GPU集群的讨论。
- en: 'The solution was obvious: “buy ’em at Fry’s,” the Valley’s dominant electronics
    retail chain, selling boards made by Zotac and Asus in Taiwan. The Lambda team
    cleared out the Bay Area’s supply of 1080 TIs, provoking something of a crisis
    for crypto-miners who needed the modules for their own servers.'

  zh: 解决方案很明显：“去Fry's买”，这是硅谷主导的电子零售连锁店，在台湾销售Zotac和Asus制造的板卡。Lambda团队清空了湾区1080 TI的供应，对需要这些模块用于他们自己服务器的加密矿工们造成了一定的危机。
- en: At that point in January 2016, Russell invited the Lambda team up to the garage
    behind the pool at Pony Tracks Ranch. He let them use the space for free; Lambda
    would just have to pay its power bill. Balaban and his team set out to build the
    servers from the bottom up, using the gaming boards with the GPU clusters. They
    installed their own one-hundred-amp breakout box at twenty-four kilowatts.

  zh: 那时是2016年1月，拉塞尔邀请Lambda团队来到Pony Tracks Ranch池子后面的车库。他让他们免费使用这个空间；Lambda只需支付电费。巴拉班和他的团队着手从底层构建服务器，使用具有GPU集群的游戏板。他们安装了自己的一百安培分流盒，功率为二十四千瓦。
- en: At 4:27 a.m. on February 13, 2016, they got the first server up and running
    with the GTX 980 TI Maxwell architecture. The peak compute rate was 5.63 teraflops,
    so they had four modules per machine, for a total of 225.2 teraflops, putting
    them on the list of the world’s top supercomputers with a near-quarter-petaflop
    cluster.

- en: Among the people taking an interest in Balaban’s progress was Georges Harik,
    a Silicon Valley titan who had, like Balaban, studied computer science at the
    University of Michigan and had then gone on to develop Google’s AdWords. Harik
    observed, “I don’t know how Dreamscope will go, but if you guys are good at Linux
    systems administration, what you can do is GPU cloud services.” That was the number-ten
    Google employee recommending that they compete with Google in the cloud. It was
    an idea.

    Dreamscope 会怎么样，但如果你们擅长 Linux 系统管理，你们可以做 GPU 云服务。” 这是谷歌的第十名员工建议他们在云计算领域与谷歌竞争。这是一个想法。
- en: Balaban and his team had learned how to maximize FLOPS per dollar on their machines,
    with the immediate result of ending the bills from Amazon. Paying off in six weeks,
    the sixty-thousand-dollar investment earned the runway to make Dreamscope a success.
    They had built up a team of Stephen and his brother, Michael; Chaun Li, their
    chief scientist and an expert in using neural networks for converting photos into
    paintings; and Steve Clarkson, who had dropped out of his Berkeley Ph.D. project
    in software engineering.

- en: By December 2016, the monetization plan for Dreamscope was sort of working—they
    had many avid users and were making some five thousand dollars a month on millions
    of downloads. With more money and a longer runway, it might take off as a profitable

- en: Balaban, however, decided to downgrade Dreamscope and go into the computer infrastructure
    market. He would sell boxes, like Michael Dell in his early years. Mixing up the
    family group, Balaban brought in a high school pal named Jackson Sengle, lured
    away from a Ph.D. in bioengineering at Dartmouth. He understood the ribosomes
    that manufacture all the proteins in your body. Why not defy the new Silicon Valley
    norm and, as Peter Thiel put it to the Fellows in 2014, “do something that everyone
    thinks is stupid”—sell homemade computers?

- en: They began putting them together manually, step-by-step, deep into the night
    above Silicon Valley. With their big advantage in GPU costs at $580 per module,
    they would not have to be especially efficient in assembly. Their product was
    a GPU workstation that contained four GPU GeForce gaming modules from Nvidia,
    which Lambda priced at ten thousand dollars apiece; if you want them rack-mounted
    for your cloud, they cost twenty-five thousand.

- en: They put it up on their own Lambda Labs website and on Amazon.com. “Not AWS,”
    Balaban points out, “just Amazon.com.” They called it the “Deep Learning DevBox”—“Dev”
    for development. They used Google AdWords to advertise. Harik was presumably pleased.

    dollars, which was five times more than Dreamscope. That was something. Then in
    April they sold seventy-five thousand dollars, fifteen times more than Dreamscope.
    In May they sold $135,000\. In August came the eclipse and proposal. By November
    they were up to nearly $500,000 and ready to launch a datacenter business, tested
    by Dreamscope, which Balaban said would be used to “dogfood our cloud service.”

    deep-learning clusters seemed to make sense. Another ex-Googler also encouraged
    Balaban. Ken Patchett, who built Google’s green field data centers in Asia and
    then went on to build data centers for Facebook, explained to him the sources
    of the excess costs in data centers. There was all that 24/7 reliability, redundancy,
