- en: There has been a large amount written and spoken about artificial intelligence,
    blockchain technology, and the implications that these technology tools will have
    on the accounting profession in both the near and long term. One just has to look
    at the frothy and volatile nature of the cryptocurrency, on top of the introduction
    of hundreds of new coins, for potential evidence of market conditions overheating.
    Such a large amount of analysis and speculation may appear to some as the symptoms
    and stages of a bubble or over excitement in the marketplace, but upon further
    review this does not appear to be the case. While technology has played an important
    role in the accounting and finance profession since the beginning of the computer
    age, there are several fundamental characteristics that differentiate these technologies
    from earlier iterations. What this book attempts to do, however, is to not only
    breakdown these sometimes amorphous technology concepts, but also analyze the
    implications of these technology tools and platforms, and to finally project possible
    implications of these tools on the financial services profession.

  zh: 有大量关于人工智能、区块链技术以及这些技术工具对会计行业在短期和长期内产生的影响的文字和言论已经得到了大量发表。人们只需看看加密货币的泡沫和波动性，以及数百种新币的推出，就可以发现市场条件过热的潜在证据。这么多的分析和猜测可能看起来像是市场泡沫或过度兴奋的症状和阶段，但进一步审查后发现情况并非如此。虽然自从计算机时代开始以来，技术在会计和金融行业发挥了重要作用，但这些技术与早期版本有几个基本特征上的区别。然而，这本书尝试的不仅仅是解释这些有时模糊的技术概念，还要分析这些技术工具和平台的影响，并最后预测这些工具对金融服务行业可能产生的影响。
- en: Finance and accounting may seem like they are only subsets of the economy, and
    depending on where you are reading this book from, might not even seem like worthy
    of an entire book in the context of blockchain technology. The majority of blockchain
    and artificial intelligence analyses have, instead, focused on the broad based
    implications of how these technologies will revolutionize not only business, but
    also society. Accounting and finance, despite the fact that they are only pieces
    of the broader economic and society, have an outsized impact on the economy and
    marketplace. The transmission of credit, safeguarding of information, and accurate
    reporting of financial information and data form the basis for how business decisions
    are made, both in local and global situations. Communicating this information,
    and doing so in an encrypted manner appears to be more important than ever in
    a world buffeted by data breaches and hacking; both technologies appear to have
    potential to facilitate this process.

  zh: 在某些地方，财务和会计可能看起来只是经济的子集，甚至在区块链技术的背景下，可能甚至不值得一整本书来探讨。相反，大多数区块链和人工智能分析都集中于这些技术将如何彻底改变不仅仅是商业，而且是整个社会的广泛影响。财务和会计，尽管它们只是更广泛经济和社会的一部分，但对经济和市场有着不成比例的影响。信贷传输、信息保障以及财务信息和数据的准确报告构成了商业决策的基础，无论是在本地还是全球情况下。在一个遭受数据泄露和黑客攻击冲击的世界中，以加密方式传播这些信息似乎比以往任何时候都更加重要；这两项技术似乎有潜力促进这一过程。
- en: Lastly, one of the core purposes of putting this text together was to not only
    discuss these wide ranging implications and technologies, but to provide readers
    suggestions and guidelines moving forward. Put simply, blockchain and artificial
    intelligence  have the potential, and to a certain extent already are, transforming
    how the financial services industry engages with the business and stakeholder
    community. Taking a broader view of the accounting and finance industry, however,
    and the implications for improved communication, data management, and data encryption
    become clearer. Suggestions, recommendations, and insights connecting these technological
    forces with the current status of the accounting and finance fields form some
    of the key takeaways of this book. Regardless of what niche of finance or accounting
    readers you find yourself employed within, there are going to be applications
    and suggestions you will find helpful contained herein.

  zh: 最后，编写这本书的一个核心目的之一是不仅讨论这些广泛的影响和技术，还要为读者提供未来的建议和指导。简而言之，区块链和人工智能具有改造金融服务行业与业务和利益相关者社区接触方式的潜力，并在一定程度上已经成为现实。然而，更广泛地看会计和金融行业以及改善通信、数据管理和数据加密的意义变得更加清晰。本书的关键收获之一是将这些技术力量与会计和金融领域的当前状况联系起来，提供建议、推荐和洞见。无论您在金融或会计领域的任何领域内工作，本书都会包含您会发现有用的应用和建议。

- en: This book focuses on blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the applications
    that these technologies will have for the financial services profession and the
    individuals employed therein. With billions invested, and thousands of very smart
    and motivated people working on these solutions there will invariably be products
    and services that succeed in the marketplace, but there will also – without a
    doubt – have many false starts. As of the writing and editing of the book during
    2018 and 2019 there was already some speculation that perhaps the hype and excitement
    around cryptocurrencies and blockchain may have very well outpaced the functionality
    of the technology at this time. For example, an August and September 2018 issue
    of the Economist focused on the let downs and perhaps over excitement that has
    embraced the cryptocurrency and broader blockchain space. At the core of the idea,
    cryptocurrencies, including the headline generating Bitcoin, were started as an
    attempt to address what were perceived to be fundamental and core failings of
    the existing financial system. Namely, the centralized nature of transaction processing
    and data verification creates a scenario in which hackers and other nefarious
    market actors do not even have to search for where valuable data is stored. Rather,
    the very centralized nature of data storage and processing creates a scenario
    in which organizations are consistently put on the defensive, with a track record
    of consistent hacks and data breaches.

- en: Framed in this context, the cryptocurrency movement has failed in its initial
    ambition – to displace traditional fiat currencies such as the USD and Euro, due
    to price volatility, lack of efficiency with regards to transactions processing,
    and a lack of merchants willing to accept cryptocurrencies as a medium of payment.
    That said, and even acknowledging the lack of applicability for currency purposes
    in the cryptocurrency marketplace, there is an appetite for investment in this
    space on the side of clients. Especially during the runup in price during the
    end of 2017, investor interest seemed to rise alongside the prices of Bitcoin
    and other various cryptocurrencies; financial professionals have a fiduciary duty
    to explain what exactly this means for investing and investment options. Put simply,
    accounting and financial services professionals must be able to offer objective
    and realistic advice in terms of both investing in these options as well as realizing
    just how much work is left to build out the technology in these spaces. Even as
    the cryptocurrency buzz and excitement has faded from the headlines alongside
    the drop in price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain has superseded
    many of the conversation in terms of excitement and investment.

    and that is the fact that does appear to be slowly entering the market conversation.
    Following the interest, investment, and dozens of conferences focused on blockchain
    applications across industry lines, the technology does appear to be entering
    the trough of disillusionment that often accompanies emerging technology forces.
    Numerous projects have been launched and funded, with IBM taking a leading role
    in assisting other organizations, but based on recent market evidence, the vast
    majority of these projects remain in pilot or beta phases. That said, there does
    remain a large amount of interest in this area which will invariably drive increased
    interest in the blockchain space at large. Understanding these emerging technologies,
    acknowledging the reality that many of these technologies are still in pilot or
    beta phases, and connecting these technologies to the financial services landscape
    are responsibilities every practitioner must understand and be aware of.

- en: Blockchain my have burst into the mainstream consciousness as a result of the
    dramatic increase in the price per bitcoin of 2017, but 2018 could be categorized
    as the trough of blockchain enthusiasm. Many of the programs that had been launched
    during the heyday of bitcoin euphoria during 2017 or during the initial part of
    2018 either remained in the pilot phase of production or had been cancelled altogether.
    Be it a result of the costs associated with implementing and maintaining blockchain
    systems, the complexity of integrating blockchain platforms with current ERP technology,
    or the fact that many blockchain based options are not as appropriate or efficient,
    many of the initiatives were cancelled or shelved during the year. This decline
    in interest and project progress was compounded by the dramatic collapse of cryptocurrency
    prices during the year, further fueling doubts of the validity or appropriateness
    of blockchain for enterprise based solutions. These are the facts on the ground,
    and as of this writing the price via cryptocurrencies seems to have stabilized,
    albeit at lower levels than those achieved during 2018 and 2019\. Even though
    blockchain projects and program continue to be launched, the focus of different
    blockchain projects and initiatives have diverted some exclusively cryptocurrency
    projects to those more enterprise based. Possibly not as scintillating as projects
    that are based around or connected exclusively to different types of cryptocurrencies
    these projects are increasingly connected to enterprise and industrial applications.

- en: Taking a step back and observing the blockchain space from a higher level and
    broader perspective this transition and development tends to make sense from a
    financial and nonfinancial perspective. First introduced with collaborations and
    partnerships between international shipping organizations with spearheaded by
    IBM and Maersk, this coordination and associated efficiency gains created a possible
    paradox for the blockchain ecosystem. On one hand, the spectacular rise in the
    price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies did attract substantial investments
    and interest from individual and institutional players, including large amounts
    of coverage in mainstream media. Of course, and as usually occurs in the marketplace,
    and especially one such as nascent and emerging as blockchain itself, the dramatic
    rise in price of cryptocurrencies was only exceeded by the collapse of different
    cryptocurrency prices in 2018\. Mirroring the price action of different cryptoassets,
    the drop in price did lead to the cancellation, shelving, and postponement of
    numerous projects. Price targets and forecasts that had been made during the enthusiastic
    increase in prices were quickly revealed to have been made with incomplete information,
    or at the very least in the heat of the proverbial moment. Even as institutional
    fund flows continued to enter the space, including the establishment and refinement

  zh: 从更高的水平和更广泛的视角回顾区块链空间，这种转变和发展在财务和非财务视角上似乎是合理的。最初由IBM和马士基等国际航运组织之间的合作伙伴关系引入，这种协调和相关效率提高为区块链生态系统创造了一个潜在的悖论。一方面，比特币和其他加密货币价格的惊人上涨确实吸引了个人和机构参与者的大量投资和兴趣，包括在主流媒体中大量的报道。当然，在市场上，特别是像区块链本身一样新兴的市场中，各种加密货币价格的剧烈上涨仅被2018年不同加密货币价格的崩溃所超越。随着不同加密资产价格的波动，价格的下跌导致了众多项目的取消、搁置和推迟。在价格上涨的热情期间做出的价格目标和预测很快就被证明是基于不完整的信息，或者至少是在热情的瞬间做出的。即使机构资金继续进入该领域，包括机构资金流入的建立和完善，人们对区块链可能最初被炒作过头的情绪仍然占据着舆论。
- en: Such a perspective is incomplete, and not to mention inaccurate, especially
    when objectively analyzed and viewed in the face of just what is going on the
    blockchain ecosystem. Be it represented by advances in smart contracts, the rise
    of decentralized exchanges and other business models running on blockchain based
    solutions or applications, or the establishment of different payment options allowing
    cryptocurrency to be used. Additionally, the continued development and building
    out of non-bitcoin blockchains such as the Ethereum has allows the investment
    and development of a number of different options to enter the broader marketplace.
    For example, blockchain can be used as an infrastructure system and platform to
    either replace or substantially augment current enterprise systems, but that is
    only the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Healthcare, transportation and logistics,
    education, food safety and treatment, retail, intellectual property and intellectual
    assets all represent prime candidates for improvement via utilizing blockchain

    That said, an appropriate way to think about the complicated relationship between

    cryptocurrencies as one tool in the proverbial toolkit used by practitioners.
    Instead of focusing on the price action linked to different cryptocurrencies,

    lets take a look at some underlying themes that are holding true. That said, there
    is another fact that must be acknowledged before we dive headfirst into this rapidly
    moving and changing technology landscape. In order for financial services professionals
    to evolve and develop into the strategic advisor and business partner so often
    cited as the end goal for the profession the current level of technological integration
    is simply not enough. As the broader business landscape continues to evolve and
    shift at an accelerating pace, it is increasingly obvious a bifurcation is occurring.
    Within the financial services landscape, which includes everyone from CPAs to
    investment bankers, there are practitioners and firms who appear to be proactively
    moving toward where the landscape is shifting, and there appear to be practitioners
    who are not doing so. Although the transition may be challenging and difficult

- en: Rather, the shift toward being future ready or future proof is one that may
    have been initiated by technology, but is much broader in scope. From Amazon to
    Tesla, customers and consumers are increasingly comfortable with technology, customized
    data, and real time analytics based on this information. Financial data, by contrast,
    especially the types of information that is reported to investors and the marketplace,
    has not changed with the rest of the business landscape. This would be a problem
    in any event, but is compounded by the following reality that has been enabled
    by the rapid technological integration of business at large. In many situations,
    especially as software and platforms become easier to use and more readily accessible
    in terms of cost, the necessity of employing a traditionally certified financial
    professional may be dropping. Of course, there are specific legal, reporting,
    and compliance based work that only a certified professional can perform (such
    as a CPA signing off on an audit), but analytics and forecasting can, and increasingly
    is, done by non-CPA, non-CFP, and non-CFA holding practitioners and firms.

    disrupted out of primary roles and responsibilities. Like many other truths and

    future is one of virtually unlimited opportunity and growth for the financial
    services profession, spurred on and driven by technology tools and adoptions.

    view that is put forth by some in the financial services space. Automation, disruption
    of current roles and responsibilities are forces already underway in the marketplace,

    ones during the process. Even as some roles and tasks are automated, however,
    it is important to weigh the learning curve and obstacles that can hamstring and
    prevent the full on implementation and adoption of different emerging technologies.
    Budgets, the complexity of technology tools itself, and the difficulty of mapping
    and connecting new technology systems to current enterprise platforms all represent
    possible stumbling blocks that might slow the adoption and integration of technology
    overall. That said, and what this book attempts to cover and discuss, are both
    the technology tools themselves as well as the implications these tools will have

    of the terminology and topics that lie at the center of this text, including not
    only the terminology and technical concepts, but also how these topics will connect
    to the financial services profession. Specifically, this chapter breaks down the
    technical topics and concepts – ranging from robotic process automation, to artificial
    intelligence, to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Reinforcing the appropriate
    definitions and terminologies associated with emerging technology is especially
    important for practitioners seeking to have intelligent conversations and debates
    around these topics moving forward. Bad information can cause even the most promising
    project to fail, and professionals must be able to objectively asses the viability
    and legitimacy of projects from both an operational and financial basis. On top
    of introducing the topics themselves, Chap. [1](467992_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml) also
    analyzes the topics and content in ways that are understandable and applicable
    for corporate practitioners. Instead of just focusing on technical, or jargon
    fueled definitions that focus on too much detail, this chapter lays the groundwork
    for the rest of the text by presenting these concepts in a manner that is understandable
    and useful for readers of this text. Technology will, and already is, changing
