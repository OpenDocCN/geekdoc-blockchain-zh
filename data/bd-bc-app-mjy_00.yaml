- en: When I recently reconnected with Dr. Michael Yuan, he had just completed successfully
    fundraising for his blockchain project CyberMiles ($CMT), which later spun off
    a technology company called Second State. Dr. Yuan was staying at the forefront
    of blockchain technology and financing. I thought back to the way he had first
    described the core technical underpinnings of Blockchain for CMT, in a remarkable
    technical white paper, and how it had resonated with my own middleware architecture
    experience and understanding at the time. He was speaking a language I understood.
    Remarkably, the vision he had first laid out is being realized in Second State
    and applied to the enterprise blockchain markets.

  zh: 当我最近与迈克尔·袁博士重新取得联系时，他刚刚成功地为他的区块链项目CyberMiles ($CMT)完成了筹款，该项目后来又分离出了一家名为Second
    State的技术公司。袁博士一直站在区块链技术和融资的前沿。我想起了他最初是如何在一份技术白皮书里描述CMT的区块链核心技术的，那与我当时的中间件架构经验和理解产生了共鸣。他说的话我能听懂。令人印象深刻的是，他最初提出的愿景正在Second
    State得到实现，并应用于企业区块链市场。
- en: Dr. Yuan was an avid proponent of open source decentralization in the early
    2000s, which is how we got to first meet. Open source software had gone from pariah
    status in late 1999 (“a cancer”) to the very bedrock of the Internet. By 2008
    “open source money,” as the Bitcoin concept was first called by its semi-anonymous
    authors, became public. What is remarkable about Bitcoin is that no one “owns
    it,” including any corporation or nation-state. It exists as an open source program
    on the Internet. Cryptocurrencies are the first killer app of open source ledgers
    as Internet-centric digital stores of value. It bears repeating that Bitcoin is
    so special in a way because it is not owned or operated by a single entity but
    in a sense is a decentralized property of the Internet. It is an open source program.
    The software implementation is under MIT Licenses (open source), which invites
    anyone with enough power to come, hash it out, and secure the network. As a result,
    the operators tend to cluster around cheap sources of power around the world because
    of the peculiar mathematics (the nuances of Bitcoin) required to secure the network.
    And it has come to pass that stores of value emerged *ex-nihilo* as open source
    crypto ledgers, the first killer app of the technology.

  zh: 袁博士是2000年代初开放源代码去中心化的热烈倡导者，这就是我们第一次见面的方式。开源软件从1999年末的“癌症”地位变成了互联网的基石。到了2008年，比特币概念最初被称为“开源货币”公开出现。比特币的特别之处在于没有人“拥有”它，包括任何公司或国家实体。它作为互联网上的一个开源程序存在。加密货币是开源账本作为以互联网为中心的数字价值储存的第一款杀手级应用。需要重复的是，比特币之所以特别，是因为它不是由单一实体拥有或运营，从某种意义上说，它是互联网的分布式财产。它是一个开源程序。软件实现受到MIT许可证（开源）的保护，邀请任何有足够力量的人来参与，解决分歧，并保障网络的安全。因此，运营商往往聚集在全球各地便宜的能源周围，因为保障网络需要解决复杂的数学问题（比特币的细微差别）。结果是，作为开源加密账本的价值储存从无到有出现，这是这项技术的首款杀手级应用。
- en: The introduction of Ethereum and the concept of smart contracts have revolutionized
    the crypto financing landscape. Remarkable capital formation dynamics appeared,
    again ex-nihilism, in the ERC20 realm. The ICO phenomenon has established behind
    the shadow of a doubt that crypto asset capital markets have the capacity to revolutionize
    financing in general. It is marking a generational shift. The financial applications
    of cryptocurrencies are in their infancy; they are only ten years old, and the
    limits of this Internet money are more psychological than technical.

  zh: 以太坊的引入和智能合约的概念彻底改变了加密融资的格局。在ERC20领域，资本形成的动态再次从无到有，ICO现象在无疑问的阴影下确立了加密资产资本市场具有改变融资方式的能力。它标志着一代人的转变。加密货币的金融应用还处于起步阶段；它们只有十岁，这种互联网货币的局限更多的是心理上的而不是技术上的。
- en: However, it is perhaps the more philosophical applications of DLTs (Decentralized
    Ledger Technology) that show even more promise in the future. Take, for example,
    the notions of (sovereign) identity and medical data attached to said identity.
    Today we can envision an Internet-centric (meaning decentralized) ID repository
    of properly secured and private biometric data. Let’s not forget that DLTs are
    distributed Internet-centric secured databases. For all you know, the DLT you
    are storing data with lives in generic cell phones with cheap algos. Instead of
    relying on a government to issue and validate identity, we now have within technical
    reach the notion of “internet Identity” in many onboarding applications. A video
    conference with trusted parties is enough to establish identity with a high level
    of trust. Many startups propose to offer this implementation of identity. To this
    identity one can attach medical data. This medical data, again philosophically,
    ultimately belongs to the individual. Technically speaking, distributed ledger
    technologies allow this to exist and, as a society, to reach for “earth-wide,
    Internet-centric” data constructs. The open source future is bright.

  zh: 然而，或许去中心化技术（DLT）更具哲学意义的应用在未来展现出了更大的前景。例如，考虑与身份相关的主权身份和医疗数据。今天，我们可以想象一个以互联网为中心（意味着去中心化）的身份识别库，它包含适当安全和私密的生物识别数据。不要忘记，分布式账本技术是分布式互联网中心的受保护数据库。你存储数据的分布式账本可能就存在于带有廉价算法的普通手机中。我们不再依赖政府发行和验证身份，在许多入职应用中，技术上已经可以实现“互联网身份”的概念。与可信方进行视频会议足以以高信任级别建立身份。许多初创公司提议提供这种身份的实现。可以将医疗数据附着在这个身份上。从哲学上讲，这些医疗数据最终属于个人。从技术上讲，分布式账本技术允许这一点的存在，并且作为一个社会，我们可以追求“全球范围内，以互联网为中心”的数据结构。开源的未来一片光明。
- en: As a historical note, advances in society are usually accompanied or even enabled
    by advances in ledger technology. Accounting, for all its boring reputation, seems
    to be essential to mankind’s progress. For example, in post-Revolution France,
    Napoleon used centralized ledgers, maintained centrally by a nation-state, written
    on paper, for the purpose of raising an army. IBM, the iconic American corporation,
    was born out of the late nineteenth century nationwide census in the United States.
    Punch cards were developed to tally the people across the vast continent. The
    counting problem led an engineering feat and the birth of Big Blue. The generations
    to come will use DLT in a variety of ways we cannot foresee today.

  zh: 作为一个历史注解，社会进步通常伴随着账本技术的进步，或者甚至是由账本技术的进步所启用。尽管会计因其无聊的名声而闻名，但它似乎对人类的进步至关重要。例如，在法国大革命后，拿破仑使用了由一个国家集中维护的、写在纸上的集中式账本，用于招募军队。IBM这家标志性的美国公司，诞生于19世纪末的美国全国人口普查。穿孔卡片是为了在大洲上汇总人口而发明的。计数问题促成了一个工程壮举和蓝色巨人的诞生。未来的几代人将以我们今天无法预见的方式使用DLT。
- en: 'But back to the present and Dr. Yuan. Michael and his focus on tooling for
    the smart contract ecosystem are insightful, informed, and timely. In this book,
    he quickly takes you down the ETH development path. Dapps are used here as concrete
    examples. The developer can quickly get to programming productivity, which is
    essential in this fast-moving ecosystem. This book is technical and covers many
    high-level aspects, including tokenomics. It is aimed at the practitioner and
    will take you through the steps to install your development environment and start
    BUIDLing a dapp. Go beyond the financial apps of DLTs and tap the vast potential
    smart contracts have to offer for the next generation of killer apps. The state
    of tools and indeed virtual machines in the DLT domain is rapidly evolving, and
    this book offers a comprehensive development introduction for the professional
    developer. HODL and BUIDL: The future is bright.'
