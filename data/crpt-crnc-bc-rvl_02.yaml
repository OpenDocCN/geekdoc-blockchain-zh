    and brokerage houses guarantee transactions. A consumer orders a shirt online,
    and the bank confirms to the vendor that the consumer can pay for it. Intermediaries

- en: It can be easy to forget how complicated these transactions can be. A person
    can’t buy something until they are certain that the seller actually owns it. At
    each stage, ownership has to be established—that the seller possesses the goods
    to be sold and the buyer possesses the means to pay for it. The agreement must
    be made by both sides and confirmed by the intermediary.

  zh: 有时我们可能会忘记这些交易有多么复杂。一个人只有在确信卖家实际上拥有商品时才能购买某物。在每一个阶段，都必须确立所有权——即卖家拥有待售商品，买家拥有支付的手段。协议必须由双方达成，并由中介确认。
- en: For larger and more complicated transactions, it should be noted, the intermediary
    could fail. Clerks can make mistakes, documents can be lost, titles can be forged,
    and officials can be bribed to change records. In the global financial crisis
    of 2007–2008, banks failed to verify that new owners could pay for the houses
    they bought.

- en: Blockchain, however, removes this uncertainty. Ownership of an asset is independently
    confirmed through the blockchain ledger. Since the ledger exists in copies distributed
    all over the world, it is extremely difficult—if not impossible—to alter it without
    detection. In addition, if one part of the network fails, the ledger that proves
    ownership will still exist in other parts of the network. This decentralized network
    is thus safe from a single person, or regime, seeking to shut it down.

- en: Blockchain, however, provides a time-stamped log of each transaction. The log
    is transparent and cannot be changed without alerting all the other people on
    the network. For example, when transporting food, the information in the log may
    include storage temperature and location, why the item was moved, and even whether
    the truck transporting the products shook too much (which can cause a significant
    loss of shelf life for some products—think bruised apples). As a result, blockchain
    can allow strangers with different goals to establish trust and work together.
    The ultimate goal is transparency that does not compromise each company’s competitive
    information. Moreover, blockchain establishes a standard ledger between parties
    that covers the details of a transaction from origin to delivery. While this structure
    by itself won’t eliminate fraud (after all, someone could deliberately enter false
    records), it establishes consistency in record keeping. Some of the largest companies
