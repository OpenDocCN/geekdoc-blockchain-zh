  zh: 区块链技术和加密货币在企业采用方面已经达到了一个拐点，这是由技术进步和金融服务、全球供应链、政府、医疗保健以及许多其他行业中的商业用例的成功试点所驱动的。企业采用仍处于初期阶段，但随着创新者继续想出更多使用区块链颠覆和重塑传统商业模式的方法，将迅速加速。已经在测试区块链解决方案的前沿行业领导者在测试区块链解决方案方面已经经历了显著的商业效益，包括：
- en: '• Better collaboration: Current enterprise solutions involve localized ERP
    or other information systems. Localized data quickly becomes fragmented in complex
    global supply chains. Each link in the supply chain updates its own database on
    its own timetable. In contrast, blockchain provides an accurate, single instance
    of encrypted data that is always up-to-date and online, eliminating conflicting
    information created by data silos and system fragmentation.'

- en: '• Enhanced security:  The distributed, immutable blockchain technology offers
    inherent security advantages over traditional record-keeping systems. Every transaction
    must be agreed upon before it’s recorded. Once recorded, every process, every
    agreement, every payment, and every task has a digital signature and record that
    can be validated and identified. The network itself is secured by a consensus
    mechanism for verification. This effectively makes it impossible for bad actors

- en: '• Greater transparency: Each participant in the network receives a full copy
    of the blockchain (as opposed to maintaining individual copies), and they must
    all agree on the entire data history and each new transaction through consensus
    or mutual agreement. If anyone tries to change a previously accepted transaction,

- en: '• Improved operations: Any business function that relies on traditional processes
    is prone to human error and often requires validation. Blockchain technology offers
    widespread application across nearly every business function to add trust and
    transparency to any transaction. This facilitates transactions being completed
    much faster and more efficiently. Since the blockchain serves as a single digital
    ledger, the need to reconcile multiple ledgers among several parties is eliminated.

  zh: • 改进运营：任何依赖传统流程的业务功能都容易出现人为错误，通常还需要验证。区块链技术可以在几乎每个业务功能中广泛应用，为任何交易增加信任和透明度。这使得交易能够更快、更高效地完成。由于区块链是一个单一的数字账本，因此消除了在多方之间对多个账本进行对账的需要。由于网络中的每个人都能够访问相同的信息，因此解决冲突数据所需的中介机构更少。
- en: '• Reduced costs:  On top of cost reduction through automation, blockchain can
    also reduce the need for many third-party services. Because trust and transparency
    are inherent in every transaction, businesses can stop relying on third parties
    to settle trade disputes and instead trust the data on the blockchain. Businesses
    can also significantly reduce the scope of internal and external audits.'

    faced by telcos. Finding the solution to the emergence of new threats powered
    by the new technologies has become the highest priority of the telecom industry.
    Blockchain can establish a secure record of the identities for the people, assets,
    personal devices and also has the ability to connect with the IoT sensors. The
    decentralized ledger could reduce the fraud and strengthen the trust between the
    transacting parties. On the same way, the proper detection of identity can be
    used to minimize the fraud, track the overall content, and direct the proper royalties.'
