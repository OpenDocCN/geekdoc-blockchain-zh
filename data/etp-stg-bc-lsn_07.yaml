    principle for firms competing in a global digital economy. Rapid innovation and
    competitive advantage have stemmed from designing customer solutions that involve
    capabilities and contributions from multiple independent firms. It is useful to

- en: Blockchain nodes can be distributed across multiple firms in a single industry
    and/or across multiple industries. This introduces the possibility of interorganizational
    collaboration to develop blockchain-based customer solutions, which ultimately
    may perform better than individual competitor offerings. Such interorganizational
    solutions can draw on the multiple capabilities of disparate partners, cocreating
    highly modular, customized customer solutions. These interorganizational blockchain-based
    customer solutions contrast with platform-based solutions where strong network
    effects lead to a few firms, sometimes just one, dominating the platform with
    winner-take-all results. In contrast, blockchain applications based on voluntary
    cross-industry cooperation by independent firms can draw on each participant’s
    distinct but complementary capabilities to create continuously improving customer
    solutions—“a proliferation of ecosystems of ecosystems.”[1](14085-0014.xhtml#en249)

- en: Such blockchain customer solutions do require that the firm step outside its
    organizational boundaries, but the blockchain value proposition increases when
    the blockchain network attracts ecosystem-wide participation. Thus, blockchain
    solutions will often require firms to coexist in an ecosystem, which collectively
    innovates and satisfies customers, enlisting each member firm in the ecosystem
    to choose roles such as orchestrator, innovator, supplier, complementor, intermediary,
    and regulator. Customers can choose between different ecosystem networks to solve
    their problems, and thus ecosystems compete with other ecosystems rather than
    firms competing against one another. However, ecosystems also require significant
    coordination by ecosystem orchestrators, which can be at odds with decentralization.
    As we have seen, some form of permissioned blockchain, with the orchestrator setting
    conditions of access to and levels of participation in the network, is often where
    enterprises have landed in their own pilots.

- en: The ecosystem mode of organization runs contrary to well-established, hierarchically
    controlled organizations. Adopting the ecosystem framework would require significant
    organizational change as the organization and its members move from hierarchy
    to greater equality. A significant task is to establish trust among ecosystem
    members. Corporate culture must now modulate a competitive ethos of rivalry and
    pursue interorganizational collaboration, following a path to informed consensus.
    Alongside the broader move to ecosystems, the organization must cope with the
    move to an unfamiliar technology—blockchain. Some fear and resistance to change
    is to be expected over replacing legacy solutions with blockchain-based solutions,
    and high-level organizational champions can help reduce anxiety over such moves.
    Education about blockchain is a necessary corollary to turn resistance into understanding
    and even informed enthusiasm. Well-designed pilots can be part of the educational
    effort, proving the concept and establishing functionality and the business case
    for a switch to blockchain. Enterprises often resort to temporary parallel tracks,
    with blockchain backstopped by legacy solutions. This helps reduce risk by protecting
    the enterprise against negative consequences from failure of the blockchain effort,
    at the cost of preserving redundancy.

    ability to replace internal combustion engines with an electric powertrain driven
    by batteries. One consequence of the rise of electric vehicles is a reduced demand
    for internal combustion engines, which threatens to obviate the significant global
    investments in internal combustion capacity by the major car companies. These

    providing quality care is continuous access to the latest patient information,

    care system has had difficulty with this primary responsibility of providing up-to-date
    patient health care records to medical providers as and when needed. The reasons

    Process variations impede the smooth transfer of health care records across organizational

    barriers stand in the way of such data handover, principally HIPAA provisions
    that motivate health care providers to err on the side of caution and delay such
    data transfer until complete assurance of compliance with HIPAA rules. The US
    health care system is fragmented, divided between governmental and private sector
    responsibilities; some segments of the private sector are for-profit entities
    and must balance profit maximization with health care provision, which affects

  zh: 因此，推动开放标准、鼓励新参与者接受、将数据安全置于首位、去中心化治理以及开发衡量进展的指标都有助于成功的TradeLens区块链应用。在完成了令人满意的初步试验后，IBM和马士基在2018年1月推出了TradeLens，到年底时已经签约了超过“100个组织，包括四家海运公司、三家内陆运输公司、四十多个全球港口和码头、大型货运代理商以及八个海关当局，横跨从鹿特丹到巴林的全球各地”。[18](14085-0014.xhtml#en266)
    TradeLens吸引了诸如陶氏化学和杜邦之类的用户，这些用户依赖TradeLens成员来运输他们的货物。
- en: Blockchain offers the possibility for entities and individuals who do not know
    each other to share data and transact in a trustless setting. The machine—the
    blockchain—provides the trust. Blockchain technology also offers significant benefits
    within ecosystems, evidenced by the number of blockchain pilot applications[19](14085-0014.xhtml#en267)
    underway at various organizations. As its value as an ecosystem utility increases,
    so does the momentum for widespread adoption. Helping other firms create and share
    value on fair terms is the best approach to encouraging participation in an emerging
    ecosystem.[20](14085-0014.xhtml#en268) Blockchain use can catalyze collaborative
    value creation, transparently allocating and recording the distribution of that
    value. Participants can judge for themselves whether their rewards are commensurate
    with their efforts.

  zh: 区块链为那些彼此不认识的实体和个人提供了在无需信任的环境中分享数据和进行交易的可能性。机器——区块链——提供了信任。区块链技术也为生态系统提供了重大益处，这从各种组织正在进行的大量区块链试点应用中就可以看出。[19](14085-0014.xhtml#en267)
    随着作为生态系统公用事业的价值增加，广泛采用的势头也在增长。帮助其他公司以公平的条款创建和分享价值是鼓励新兴生态系统参与的最佳途径。[20](14085-0014.xhtml#en268)
    区块链的使用可以催化协同价值创造，透明地分配和记录这部分价值的分配。参与者可以自行判断他们的回报是否与他们的努力相符。
- en: In the next and final chapter, I build on the insights from the various industry
    and ecosystem application examples to outline strategic steps for enterprises
    to decide whether blockchain is appropriate for the problems they wish to solve,
    and if so, how to develop and implement such blockchain applications.
