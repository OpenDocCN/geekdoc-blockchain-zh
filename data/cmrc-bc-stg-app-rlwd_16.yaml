    the entirety of the supply chain now knows this supplier is untrustworthy. Either

    will come when DLT can be reliably used not only as a method of sharing transactional
    data and contractual terms, but of executable code itself. This will have far-ranging
    implications. In the realm of security, the ability to perform a consensus check
    to validate a block of code will render ineffective almost all of the hacking
    exploits currently in use. With regards to interoperability, DLT applications
    will be able to seamlessly apply bug fixes or feature upgrades on their own ledgers,
    vastly reducing both cost and risk of deployment, as well as eliminating the support
    nightmare of users running lagged versions. With regard to piracy, it will virtually
    eliminate all current methods of counterfeiting. Within 10 years, I predict that
    DLT will underlie the deployment mechanism for at least 90% of all software applications,
    both business and consumer. And for many of the same reasons, it seems likely
