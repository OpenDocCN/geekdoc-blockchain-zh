    technology trends poised to explode in the next decade. Most important among them,
    for blockchain, are IoT and AI. Today we think of organizations as made up mostly
    of people. Yet in a short few years, the number of intelligent assets in an organization

    cities. Security guards might “rent” a unit when the real property owners are
    out of town, or the tenants themselves might allow illegal sublets. The challenge
    of housing fraud is pushing China to try a different approach. In the northern
    city of Xiong’an, planners aim to fight housing fraud and improve access to property
    for tenants with the support of blockchain. A representative from Ant Financial
    explained the approach: “The blockchain will be used to validate that the property
    is real. The landlord and the tenant will consent on the blockchain to the terms
    and conditions of the rental. Another benefit of blockchain is that when tenants
    apply for a housing loan, they do not need to involve multiple agencies to prove
    the truthfulness of their rental. As a result, this blockchain rental solution
    allows tenants to enjoy a more convenient property rental experience.”[¹](../Text/notes.html#ch7-en1)

    a group in the traditional sense. There is no leader, and participants are not

    while in it. This quality suggests that successful blockchain leaders will be
    skilled at framing goals or problems and encouraging qualified participants to
    opt in to a project. Clear goal framing, clear definitions of desired outcomes,
    and clear incentives allow participants to join and take actions that benefit
    them as individuals and the network as a whole. Blockchain solutions like Colony
    or Bounty0x, a task-posting blockchain solution, can provide the technical mechanisms

    Colony 或 Bounty0x 这样的区块链解决方案，一个发布任务的区块链解决方案，可以提供组织和参与者执行愿景的技术机制。[^(17)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en17)

    formed or participated in agile teams or whose organizations have taken a bimodal
    approach to digital transformation will be familiar with this type of team development.[^a](../Text/footnotes.html#ch8-fna)
    Blockchain leaders will need skills similar to those of agile leaders. They must
    maintain a broad overview, seeing connections between the disparate parts and
    identifying any needs. Instead of communicating from the top down, a blockchain
    leader will connect people, things, or resources that might not be aware of each
    other.[^(18)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en18) The leaders will continue doing so

    区块链领导者将需要类似于敏捷领导者的技能。他们必须保持广泛的视野，看到不同部分之间的联系，并确定任何需求。区块链领导者不会采用自上而下的沟通方式，而是将会连接可能不知道彼此的人、事物或资源。[^(18)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en18)

    shift those goals as they gain skills or see new opportunities. In practical terms,
    workers (human beings or things) will choose whether to bid on a task or participate
    in a project; they won’t be assigned, as they are in most environments today.
    Importantly, the opt-in model could be used as easily with an internal talent
    pool as with a decentralized workforce. The model could operate by having all
    participants identified with a tokenized set of data that documents their skills,
    knowledge, credentials, reliability, preferred schedule, and past achievements.
    Lubin said that ConsenSys is experimenting with a token-reward system that rewards
    people for filling out onboarding information, for example, or putting their skills
    profile into a tokenized wallet they could use to get involved in projects. The
    same approach could apply to you as a leader.

- en: The subject of liability in blockchain comes up regularly with our clients,
    mostly in the context of uncertainty. For example, leaders grapple with who is

- en: When an organization runs afoul of regulatory guidelines in a centralized environment,
    regulators turn to leaders to make good. In extreme cases, those leaders can go
    to jail. That’s a pretty good motivator to stay on the right side of the law.
    As we have highlighted throughout this chapter, however, decentralized organizations
    with operations unfolding autonomously over a network don’t have leaders in the
    same way that hierarchical organizations operating in the physical world do. Can
    a DAO in this situation even be regulated? Should DAOs be regulated in the same
    way that a traditional human-centric organization is regulated? If a regulatory
    breach—even one caused by a mistake in one line of code out of millions—should
    occur, who should bear the brunt of the responsibility? We don’t know the answers
    to those questions, and regulators have not publicly weighed in on the regulatory
    nuances of blockchain governance, beyond some dialogue about cryptocurrencies.

- en: Another big issue with complex implications is decision-making oversight. In
    a physical environment, where most decisions are made by people, there are natural
    checks and balances. Leaders hear opinions from their superiors, peers, subordinates,

    input. Unintended consequences will become clear eventually, but perhaps only
    after millions of interactions and transactions.

- en: Blockchain purists believe that the consensus mechanism, if large enough, would
    throw out bad decisions. We think it unwise to take the safety of this mechanism
    for granted. Our concern is exacerbated by the paucity of ethical structures and
    governance surrounding the use of AI. Organizations can decide as a matter of
    policy to code leadership oversight into the operations of DAOs. But maintaining
    policy consistency and authority as DAOs grow to millions of lines of code applied
    in multiple jurisdictions and constantly updated might be challenging. Oversight
    and governance, in sum, have few simple solutions.

    DAO 运营中。但随着 DAO 不断增长到成百万行的代码，应用于多个司法管辖区并不断更新，保持政策一致性和权威可能是具有挑战性的。概括而言，监督和治理没有简单的解决方案。

    default to a set of hardwired habits is well documented in behavioral psychology.[^(35)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en35)
    Organizations are also vulnerable to defaults, as Clayton Christensen highlights
    in *The Innovator’s Dilemma*.[^(36)](../Text/notes.html#ch8-en36) Default behaviors

  zh: 我们看到区块链社会在促进参与和公平方面有着巨大的潜力。但这个社会也带来了一些围绕安全、隐私和数据所有权的风险。
- en: In a blockchain society, security becomes both more advanced and much more complex.
    We have repeatedly tried to debunk the idea of blockchain as an unhackable system.
    Though aspects of blockchain-complete solutions make them difficult to compromise,
    there are still vulnerabilities in the peripheral technologies used with or on
    top of the blockchain ledger. Cryptocurrency wallets, for example, are insecure
    in their current form, and there have been multiple compromises of token holdings
    at crypto exchanges as well as hacks to smart contract code. IoT systems are also
    highly insecure; they currently lack checks and balances to confirm if the data
    captured and imported reflect reality.

  zh: 在区块链社会中，安全性变得更加先进和复杂。我们已经多次试图驳斥区块链作为不可破解系统的观点。尽管区块链完整解决方案的某些方面使其难以受到破坏，但在使用或加在区块链分类账上的外围技术中仍然存在漏洞。例如，加密货币钱包在其当前形式下是不安全的，加密货币交易所的令牌持有和智能合约代码的多次遭到破坏也是如此。物联网系统也非常不安全；它们目前缺乏核查和平衡来确认捕获和导入的数据是否真实。
- en: A related issue around security is key management. SSI, cryptocurrency ownership,
    and network access are all enabled through the use of security keys, which are
    much like passwords but are issued by the solutions themselves. And just as they
    do with passwords, participants must keep track of keys. Lose them, and you lose
    access to your tokens, your IDs, and so forth, and there is no way to recover
    them. Loss of a key is a major risk in an entirely digital system. A real-world
    demonstration of the risk took place in February 2019, when the CEO of a crypto-exchange
    died in possession of the only key to the stored $137 million in tokens.[^(28)](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en28)

  zh: 安全领域的一个相关问题是密钥管理。SSI、加密货币所有权和网络访问都通过使用安全密钥来实现，这些密钥很像密码，但是由解决方案自身发行。就像处理密码一样，参与者必须跟踪密钥。一旦丢失，你就会丢失对你的令牌、身份等的访问权限，而且没有办法恢复它们。在完全数字化的系统中，密钥的丢失是一个重大风险。这个风险的现实演示发生在2019年2月，当时一个加密货币交易所的CEO去世，持有存储的价值1370万美元的令牌的唯一密钥也就荡然无存[^28]。
- en: The question of data ownership will also continue to vex us as society becomes
    more programmable. Societal systems designed to capture member data will underlie
    all programmable environments, whether they are programmed or blockchain. How
    can we as leaders and society members be sure that no single actor gains access
    to all of it? We can start by building decentralized systems and rejecting the
    centralized models pushed by powerful corporations. This strategy would require
    consumers to move en masse away from the proven, centralized platforms that give
    us so many benefits. Such a change will not happen in democratic societies without
    strong commercial alternatives. Data decentralization in nondemocratic societies
    will be even more challenging, since government agencies in these societies have
    few restrictions on what they can access. The social scoring system described
    in [chapter 7](../Text/chapter07.html) in the context of smart cities takes on
    a more sinister cast when a government can use it without limits. China’s social
    credit system is already reportedly influencing who is allowed to travel by airplane
    or work on certain projects.[^(29)](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en29)

  zh: 数据所有权的问题在社会变得更加可编程时也会继续困扰我们。设计用于捕获成员数据的社会系统将构成所有可编程环境的基础，无论它们是程序设计还是区块链。作为领导者和社会成员，我们如何能确保没有单一的行为者能够获得其中的全部数据？我们可以从建立去中心化系统并拒绝强大公司推动的中心化模式开始。这种策略将需要消费者大规模地远离为我们带来如此多好处的经过验证的中心化平台。在没有强大商业替代方案的民主社会中，这样的变革不会发生。在非民主社会中，数据去中心化将更具挑战性，因为这些社会的政府机构对它们可以访问的内容几乎没有限制。在智能城市的背景下描述的社会评分系统，当政府可以无限制地使用它时，就会带上更加阴险的色彩。据报道，中国的社会信用体系已经影响了谁可以乘飞机旅行或在某些项目上工作。
- en: Citizen engagement likewise poses a challenge within a blockchain society. Throughout
    the examples we highlighted, such as voting and involvement in local investments,
    we have assumed that people will want to be involved. But do they? Voter participation
    is low in many countries, not just because of the voting challenges we described
    earlier in the chapter, but because some people don’t want to vote, don’t think
    voting is important, or don’t believe their vote matters.

  zh: 公民参与同样在区块链社会中提出了挑战。在我们强调的例子中，如投票和参与地方投资，我们假设人们会想要参与。但是他们会吗？在许多国家，选民参与度很低，不仅仅是因为我们在本章早些时候描述的投票挑战，而且因为一些人不想投票，不认为投票很重要，或者认为他们的选票无关紧要。
- en: Similar questions about participation and behavior apply to the community of
    technology developers who have so much control over the algorithms that will govern
    important social infrastructure. Some in the field have proposed a Hippocratic
    oath for software developers.[^(30)](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en30) More recently,
    B9lab proposed a Satoshi oath as an invitation for blockchain developers to consider
    how the values of immutability, neutrality, and decentralization will be manifested
    in each project they touch.[^(31)](../Text/notes.html#ch9-en31) The idea is to
    provide a structure for people to start governing their choices as a blockchain
    society evolves.

  zh: 类似的关于参与和行为的问题也适用于那些对将管理重要社会基础设施的算法拥有如此大的控制权的技术开发者社区。该领域的一些人提出了一项面向软件开发者的希波克拉底誓言。最近，B9lab提出了一项“中本聪誓言”，邀请区块链开发者考虑不可变性、中立性和去中心化的价值如何在他们接触的每个项目中得以体现。该想法是为人们提供一个结构，以便他们在区块链社会不断发展的过程中开始管理自己的选择。
- en: These issues all point to the reality that changing a societal contract is not
    just about building the infrastructure necessary to do so, but also about attracting
    people to raise their hands and participate in building it. Just as the blockchain
    organization requires participants to join the collaboration, so too does the
    blockchain society. The rewards and incentive model native to blockchain could
    help drive that participation. The complicated role played by things has great
    bearing on a blockchain society. Machines that can interact with each other and
    exchange value may create governance rules for themselves. This self-governing
    ability gives a whole new angle to the idea of shared intelligence and shared
    decision making.

  zh: 所有这些问题都指向了一个现实，那就是改变社会契约不仅仅是建立必要的基础设施，而且也是吸引人们举手参与其中建设的过程。正如区块链组织需要参与者加入合作一样，区块链社会也是如此。区块链本土的奖励和激励模式可以帮助推动参与。物的复杂角色对区块链社会有很大影响。可以相互交互并交换价值的机器可能会为自己制定治理规则。这种自治能力给共享智慧和共同决策的想法带来了全新的视角。

    The programmable future will touch every aspect of our lives. Blockchain is already
    gaining traction as a tool to empower societies and citizens. Ongoing experiments
    are using blockchain in government applications in Zug, Switzerland, and the US
    city of Austin. In Jordan, blockchain is enabling resource access by Syrian refugees.
    In Brooklyn, blockchain is part of a crucial experiment in off-grid, decentralized
    energy generation. The technology is also part of an effort to activate local
    investment in infrastructure projects through the issuing of blockchain-based
    municipal bonds. These solutions and others could help drive citizens toward a
    blockchain society running on decentralized systems that empower participants
    and encourage transparent and fair access to resources. The alternative is a programmed
    society in which individuals and organizations relinquish control over data, access,
    and resources to a centralized power. The choice is still ours to make.
