  zh: 摘要
- en: 'Blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed ledger technology that provides
    openness and confidence for a new age of transactional applications. The fundamental
    fabric for bitcoin is blockchain, which is a design pattern made up of three core
    elements: a distributed network, a public ledger, and digital transactions. Digital
    transactions are recorded in a public ledger by members of the distributed network.
    Members of the network run algorithms to test and validate the planned transaction
    before adding it to the network. The latest transaction is applied to the public
    ledger if a number of the network participants believe that the transaction is
    legitimate. In minutes or seconds, changes to the public ledger are mirrored in
    all copies of the blockchain. A transaction is immutable after it has been added
    and cannot be reversed or deleted. No one user of the network has the ability
    to tamper with or change data, and everybody in the network has a full copy of
    the blockchain. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of nodes made up of
    network members.'

  zh: 引言
- en: Blockchain has become recognised as the distributed ledger for all transactions
    and solved the double-spend issue by integrating peer-to-peer infrastructure with
    public-key cryptography after it was first conceptualised as a central feature
    to facilitate transactions in the digital currency – Bitcoin. A blockchain, literally,
    is a network of knowledge blocks that records Bitcoin transactions; of course,
    there are strict laws that regulate how to check the block's authenticity to ensure
    that it cannot be changed or vanish. Blockchain technology refers to the algorithms
    and computing infrastructure for generating, adding, and utilising blocks. The
    double-spend dilemma is solved by blockchain technologies using public-key cryptography,
    in which each individual is given a private key and a public key is exchanged
    with all other users. The basic concept behind blockchain is that it is a distributed
    ledger that contains records of transactions that are exchanged by participants.
    None each of these transactions is validated by a plurality of the system's users,
    illegitimate transactions are unable to pass mutual scrutiny. A record can never
    be changed once it is generated and approved by the blockchain. Existing blockchain
    research has primarily concentrated on device performance, stability, and novel
    applications. One of the most critical problems for blockchain is performance
    (Abbott, 2000; Allenby, 2012; Almeida et al., 2015; Antonopoulos, 2014; Ansell
    & Gash, 2007). To build a new transaction record on the blockchain, a very strict
    authentication procedure is needed, which results in a substantial delay in validation
    period and waste of computational resources.

- en: A transaction currently requires about 10 minutes to be authenticated. Thousands
    of nodes are now working to process and validate transfers. These problems severely
    restrict the scope of blockchain implementations. As an alternative, Since IoT
    devices which have to deal with limited computing capacity or low strength, existing
    blockchain approaches are typically not appropriate for the Internet of Things
    (IoT) network. As an innovative platform, blockchain has been hailed as a new
    way to address the demands of individuals, technology, and organisations. For
    a contract, trust has become a critical function that blockchain may offer. People
    could be able to share their assets without fear of violating their privacy thanks
    to modern confidence structures emerging from Blockchain. The blockchin technology
    allows for open, peer-to-peer, and coalition-based business group organisation.
    The Bitcoin framework has served as a realistic model of a decentralised enterprise
    under which no single government is in charge of the system's problem and management.
    The peer-to-peer relationships between nodes in the blockchain framework are peer
    to peer. Furthermore, blockchains have the ability to organise, vote, and shape
    coalitions. The blockchain system's technical components include trustless computation,
    smart contracts, and network stability (Dubovitskaya et al., 2017; Kblaw et al.,
    2016; Mylrea & Gourisetti, 2017; Strobel et al., 2018; Yaji et al., 2018).

    problems in health IT systems and become the technological norm that allows patients,
    health care professionals, health care agencies, and medical researchers to safely
    exchange electronic health records. Each network participant keeps an identical

    sort of data or digital asset, and the network that implements the blockchain
    determines what type of data is held in each transaction. To ensure authenticity
    and consistency, data is secured and digitally signed. Blocks are used to organise
    transactions, and each block incorporates a cryptographic hash of the previous
    block in the blockchain. The blocks are placed in a chronological sequence. Bitcoin
    is a cryptocurrency trading network that is built on open-source cryptographic
    protocols and has proved to be extremely safe. Although the names behind certain
    Bitcoin transactions remain secret, the network promotes openness by allowing

    being one of the most exciting. Food protection by provenance traceability, database
    systems, agro-trade, banking, seed registration, and insurance are all examples
    of blockchain applications in agriculture. As a result, the aim of this paper
    is to study blockchain applications in agriculture from all major databases, ranging
    from Web of Science to Scopus. According to the report, although there are several
    blockchain-based applications in agriculture, only a few countries have grasped
    it, with China leading the way, led by the United States, Italy, India, and Spain.
    This paper also examines emerging developments in blockchain science in agriculture
    and offers recommendations for potential research. Blockchain is the most talked-about
    topic in today's environment, and it is also regarded as one of the most destructive
    inventions to date. Blockchain is a public ledger that is decentralised and unaltered
    cryptographically. It is used to document the past of digital transactions (IBM,
    Hyperledger). In a blockchain scheme, each participant (stakeholder) keeps a copy
    of all previous transactions that have ever been processed via the system. However,
    no one party/node owns the machine, indicating that it is not centralised. This
    model of decentralised structure establishes a basis of confidence since all operation
    in the system is transparent and auditable by all stakeholders. For any transaction
    to take place, a consensus algorithm must be followed, which ensures that a majority
    of nodes must consent on the matter in order for it to be validated and approved.
    Furthermore, since a blockchain-based framework does not need a mediator or third
    party for transactions, settlement costs are reduced. This transactions are often
    permanent, eliminating the need for every public or private entity to serve as
    a middleman, resulting in a more effective method. The members concerned do not
    need to trust each other since the structure and code are foolproof.

    between two individuals or groups. All in the village gathers on a shared forum
    for this exchange, which takes place in front of everyone. All should keep a record
    of this exchange in their notebook. Now, in the future or at any moment, none
    of the two parties involved in the transaction will say any incorrect details
    or dispute the transaction since everybody in the village has the original note.
    In order to falsify the information, the fraudster will then have to alter the
    notice on everyone's copy in the village, which is impossible in practise. Assume
    that these transactions take place through machines, and that each of the villagers
    has their own machine where the record is kept. Furthermore, these transfers are
    encrypted, authenticated, and validated by anonymous approvers (also called as
    miners). This is how it works in a real-world blockchain environment, where all
    data/records are held in blocks and everybody on the network has a copy. Any new
    transactions are introduced to the new stack, which is connected to the previous
    ones. Since it is cryptographically protected, it cannot be tampered with. Figure
    1 depicts the detailed operation of a blockchain-based method, which can be illustrated
    in six simple measures. In phase one, a transaction is demanded, and in step two,
    it is broadcast to all related networks.

    technology, which has the ability to disrupt the global fiat monetary system.
    Bitcoin, a newly created cryptocurrency that has sparked global interest and anticipation,
    is built on the blockchain's operational features. Rather than relying on a centralised
    infrastructure, blockchain technology distributes a database through a network
    of interconnected data networks. A blockchain is a computing data system that
    stores all transactions that have occurred since the blockchain's inception. This
    arrangement is copied and exchanged among all networked computers that participate.
    When a new transaction is submitted, it is batched with other transactions to
    form a “stack,” and is then regularly added to the front of the blockchain as
    the most recent “block” of transactions. The network of participating computers
    updates their blockchain to match the agreed blockchain until the “block” is acknowledged
    by a plurality of machines.

  zh: 区块链技术正在为一种现代形式的货币结算奠定基础，该技术有能力颠覆全球法定货币体系。比特币是一种新创建的加密货币，引发了全球范围内的兴趣和期待，它是建立在区块链操作特性之上的。区块链技术不依赖于集中式基础设施，而是通过一个由相互连接的数据网络组成的网络来分布数据库。区块链是一个计算数据系统，它存储了自区块链成立以来发生的所有交易。这个安排被复制并在所有参与的网络计算机之间交换。当提交新的交易时，它将与其他交易一起批处理，形成一个“堆栈”，然后定期添加到区块链的前端作为最新的交易“块”。参与的计算机网络更新他们的区块链，以匹配约定的区块链，直到“块”被多数计算机承认。
- en: 'The benefits of blockchain are many. To begin with, it is currently a peer-to-peer
    network with no single point of failure. If one node fails, the remaining nodes
    can continue to function, ensuring the system''s availability and viability. Second,
    nearly all of the data is digital and can be used in a variety of applications.
    Third, since all transactions on the Blockchain are transparent to all users,
    auditability and confidence are improved. Fourth, making modifications to the
    Blockchain is exceedingly complex, because if it were to arise, it would be apparent
    to all other users, and if not validated, it would be removed from the block.
    The scope for blockchain to be used is undeniable. “Blockchain has the power to
    transform the way we purchase and sell, engage with government, and check the
    validity of everything from land deeds to organic vegetables,” according to Goldman
    Sachs. It blends the transparency of the internet with the reliability of cryptography
    to provide a quicker, more secure way for anyone to validate key details and build
    trust.” While a large number of companies are working on blockchain initiatives,
    it does not appear that full-scale deployment is yet taking place. When early
    adopters share their success stories, this would most certainly shift. One part
    of deployment that is yet to be decided is whether the gain can exceed the expense.
    Since the complete utility of blockchain technologies cannot be achieved without
    input from relevant third parties, comprehensive replacement of legacy applications
    and processes is currently not feasible. This creates a conundrum for implementers
    who wish to venture past the exploratory stage: will substantial capital investments
    be justified for a technology that has little use right now? The most probable
    programmes to be implemented would be those of a precise and limited focus, allowing
    for straightforward and prompt follow-up and review.'

    The above is a permissioned network that operates on an invite-only basis and
    centralises write permissions with a single entity/organization. As a result,

    between a completely decentralised public Blockchain and a single highly trustworthy
    individual paradigm with a private block chain. It is a combination between the
    two forms of Blockchains and is partly decentralised, with the consensus mechanism
    regulated by a pre-selected collection of nodes. For example, in a coalition of

    by demonstrating identity (authentication) and permissions (authorisation). Each
    user has one private and one public cryptographic key under Blockchain technology,

    sent to his or her address with his or her public key. A digital signature is
    formed by two keys working together, and the information sent/received is part

    higher education. They alert about what could inevitably happen if such technology
    is not implemented, but they also urge us to investigate the vast possibilities
    of how blockchain technology might enhance the condition of higher education.
    They describe four places of higher education where innovators can focus: student
    data, pedagogy, prices, and instructional models (or the meta-university). The
    definition of meaning is central to their argument, and the internet is severely
    constrained in this regard. We may exchange records over the internet, but we''re
    exchanging versions of documentation and archives, not the originals. They find
    out that the blockchain can be used to hold almost every kind of data or knowledge
    that is valuable to humanity. It can be used to preserve any of a person''s data
    throughout the course of their whole lives. This technology will and will be used
    to document educational milestones in the process of How, according to them. When
    technology such as blockchain become more associated with work and careers in
    the twenty-first century, they often clarify how higher education would be forced
    to adapt or lose its importance. Although transition is difficult for higher education
    organisations, they contend that the shift to blockchain would compel them to
    find new ways to remain effective.On the surface, the two seem to be at odds with
    how the government can treat revenue, so it seems to be a strange similarity.
    They contend, though, that this technology is beneficial to Libertarians because
    it removes capital from the government''s hands and places it in the hands of
    the citizens. This encourages the government to play a smaller part. In such a
    scheme, loans will not need to be vetted by a financial institution. As a consequence,
    the government will not be liable for any erroneous purchases. This is analogous
    to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation''s current position (FDIC). For the
    same purposes, undermining the government''s financial foundations and government-backed
    insurance will allow people more influence. This might lead to increased banking
    openness, ensuring that everyone receives equal care. Under a particular scenario,
    blockchain''s capacity to act as a database might allow for the proper tracking
    and logging of laboured hours in a decentralised manner. Manipulation would be
    even harder to get away with, encouraging people to ensure that anyone else should
    function was doing so.'

  zh: 当我们继续向前推进时，区块链技术将成为高等教育最相关的技术。他们警告说，如果不实施这样的技术，必然会发生什么，但他们也敦促我们调查区块链技术可能如何增强高等教育状况的广阔可能性。他们描述了四个高等教育领域的创新者可以关注的地方：学生数据、教学法、价格和教学模式（或元大学）。意义的定义在他们的论点中是至关重要的，而互联网在这方面受到严重限制。我们可以通过互联网交换记录，但我们交换的是文件和档案的版本，而不是原件。他们发现，区块链可以用来保存几乎对人类有价值的任何数据或知识。它可以用来保存一个人的所有数据，直到他们一生。这项技术将被用来记录教育里程碑的过程。当像区块链这样的技术在二十一世纪与工作和职业更相关联时，他们经常澄清高等教育将被迫适应或失去重要性。尽管过渡对于高等教育机构来说是困难的，但他们认为，转向区块链将迫使它们找到保持有效的新方法。表面上看，这两者似乎与政府如何处理收入存在矛盾，所以这似乎是一种奇怪的相似性。但他们认为，这项技术对古典自由主义者有利，因为它将资本从政府手中移走，并将其置于公民手中。这鼓励政府扮演更小的角色。在这样的方案中，贷款将不需要经过金融机构的审核。因此，政府将不对任何错误购买负责。这与联邦存款保险公司目前的立场类似。出于相同的目的，破坏政府的财政基础和政府支持的保险将允许人们拥有更多的影响力。这可能会导致银行业的透明度增加，确保每个人都能得到平等的关注。在特定情况下，区块链作为数据库的能力可能允许以分散的方式正确跟踪和记录工作小时。操纵将更加难以逃脱，鼓励人们确保其他人是否在进行工作。
- en: We are now seeing mainstream acceptance of blockchain technologies due to its
    strong appeal. Given that virtually every industry employs a kind of agile record-keeping,
    it is fair to anticipate this technology to be extended to a broad variety of
    applications, some of which have been pointed at in previous pages, such as the
    possibility for a smart city, whilst others are either in progress or have yet
    to be found. Furthermore, because of the peer-to-peer aspect of the technology
    and the fact that any stakeholder has access to their own block of the ledger,
    falsifying details or cooking the books has never been easier. This in itself
    has the ability to boost customer confidence in these latest technical disruptions.
    Since the underpinnings of any emerging technology are not fully known, it is
    impossible to predict how broadly the technology would be implemented. Future
    studies should look at these issues and emerging technologies, as well as the
    technology's acceptance rates. Further research will reveal what improvements
    (if any) in efficiency have been reported for those that have adopted blockchain.
    Studies may also look at the reasons why this technology hasn't caught on, as
    well as customer trust levels. Furthermore, as technology advances, potential
    research will be able to shed light on some protection vulnerabilities that were
    not originally identified. Blockchain has exploded in prominence, gaining traction
    in virtually every sector from banking and healthcare to schooling to community
    planning. It all began with some uploaded code by an unknown programmer with the
    intention of building a new currency network. Finally, blockchain technology seems
    to have the ability to revolutionise processes that maintain track of the existence
    of objects through a greatly enhanced, open ledger mechanism, in addition to improving
    tasks in existing industries.

- en: The transaction is deemed true if the consensus of nodes decides on its legitimacy.
    Any of the nodes are referred to as “miners.” They function on the next block
    with specialised hardware. Miners combine all usable transactions from the transaction
    pool into a new nominee block. A proof of work concept is used to mine a block
    of Bitcoin. That is, the data from the nominee block is used to generate a random
    hash value. To correctly estimate a hash value, you'll need a lot of computing
    power that can measure millions of values in a second. A given complexity goal
    must be met by the correct hash value. This number is derived from all block metadata,
    including the previous block's hash. This is the most important aspect of Blockchain
    stability. If anyone attempts to alter a previous transaction, the hash value
    of the block containing the transaction must be recalculated.

- en: We performed a literature review for this study to see what level of support
    there is in the written literature about the consistency criteria for Blockchain
    implementations. Blockchain is a decentralised ledger mechanism that ensures the
    confidentiality of transaction records. It is well regarded as the infrastructure
    that powers the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. When the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was first
    launched, blockchain technology was utilised for the first time. Bitcoin is now
    the most widely adopted platform based on Blockchain technologies. Bitcoin is
    a decentralised digital money payment mechanism based on the Blockchain public
    transaction ledger. The most important characteristic of Bitcoin is that the currency's
    value can be maintained without the intervention of any company or government.
    The Bitcoin network's amount of transactions and users is continuously growing.
    In addition, common currency conversions, such as KRW, EUR, and USD, occur often
    in currency exchange markets. As a result, Bitcoin has attracted the interest
    of a variety of cultures and is becoming the most common digital currency based
    on Blockchain technology. The shared key infrastructure (PKI) system is used for
    Bitcoin. The consumer only has one set of public and private keys in PKI. The
    public key is used in the user's Bitcoin wallet address, while the private key
    is used to authenticate the user. The sender's public key, various receiver's
    public keys, and the value exchanged make up a Bitcoin transaction. The transaction
    will be published in a block in around ten minutes. A previously written block
    is then added to this latest block. Both blocks, including details about each
    transaction, are maintained on the users' nodes' disc drive. Each node stores
    details regarding all Bitcoin network transactions and uses previous blocks to
    verify the validity of each new transaction. Checking the correctness of transactions
    rewards the nodes. This approach is known as mining, and it is supported by Proof-of-Work,
    one of the most important principles of Blockchain technology. A agreement occurs
    between all nodes when all transactions are successfully verified. The latest
    blocks are connected to the previous blocks, and they are all aligned in a single
    chain. The distributed ledger technique used for Bitcoin is called Blockchain,
    and it consists of a series of blocks.

  zh: 我们为这项研究进行了文献回顾，以了解关于区块链实现的一致性标准有多少支持。 区块链是一种分散式分类账机制，可以确保交易记录的保密性。 它被广泛认为是支持比特币加密货币的基础设施。
    当比特币加密货币首次推出时，区块链技术首次被利用。 比特币现在是基于区块链技术的最广泛采用的平台。 比特币是一种基于区块链公共交易分类账的分散式数字货币支付机制。
    比特币最重要的特征是货币的价值可以在没有任何公司或政府干预的情况下得以维持。 比特币网络的交易量和用户数量不断增长。 此外，常见货币转换，如KRW，EUR和USD，在货币兑换市场上经常发生。
    因此，比特币吸引了各种文化的兴趣，并且正在成为基于区块链技术的最常见的数字货币。 比特币使用共享密钥基础设施（PKI）系统。 消费者在PKI中只有一组公钥和私钥。
    公钥用于用户的比特币钱包地址，而私钥用于身份验证用户。 发件人的公钥，各种收件人的公钥和交换的价值组成一个比特币交易。 大约十分钟内，交易将被发布在一个区块中。
    然后将之前写过的区块添加到此最新区块中。 包括每笔交易的详细信息的两个区块都保留在用户节点的磁盘驱动器上。 每个节点存储有关所有比特币网络交易的详细信息，并使用先前的区块验证每个新交易的有效性。
    检查交易的正确性会奖励节点。 这种方法被称为挖矿，它受到区块链技术最重要的原则之一，工作量证明的支持。 当所有交易成功验证时，所有节点之间会达成一致。 最新的区块连接到之前的区块，并且它们都排列在一个单一的链中。
    用于比特币的分布式分类账技术称为区块链，它由一系列区块组成。

- en: In this part, the fundamentals of blockchain. We agree that understanding the
    core concept behind blockchain technology and the fundamentals of how it operates
    is critical to evaluating and analysing the effects it can have. We would not
    go through technological depth, but rather focus on the most critical characteristics
    of blockchain, as well as its benefits and drawbacks in terms of financial sectors.
    Blockchain first appeared in 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown individual
    or group of people, introduced the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a digital
    money that is “mined” by people using apps to solve mathematical problems on machines
    all around the world. Bitcoin's core code is called blockchain. It's important
    to realise that blockchain and Bitcoin are not the same thing. Consider blockchain
    to be an operating system similar to Windows or Macintosh, with Bitcoin being
    only one of the programmes that will work on it. Despite technical advancements
    (such as telephone lines, credit card networks, and the internet) that have rendered
    trade quicker, more reliable, and more trustworthy, many business transactions
    remain inefficient, costly, and fragile. (2018, IBM) Blockchain may be the key
    to make business transactions more cost-effective, reliable, safe, and stable,
    as it aims to deter bribery, improve confidence and accountability, and save time
    and money by replacing intermediaries. While we are looking at the potential uses
    of finance and accounting with blockchain technology (also known as distributed
    ledger technology), it is important to note that blockchain is not a financial
    platform in and of itself. Blockchain isn't an accounting forum, a journal entry
    service, or a substitute for accounting apps, according to Smith . However, blockchain
    expands on the concept of standard double entry accounting by “adding a third
    entry” that validates both sides of a transaction in the same block. In a typical
    dealing case, all sides maintain their own ledgers and logs of the transaction.

- en: In next generation networks, blockchain is a technology that redefines confidence.
    It promotes the concept of handling some kind of transaction without the use of
    a middleman. Mediators, including companies and states, often appear as key bodies
    that collect, handle, and store transactions. Much of our confidence in a scheme
    comes from the mediators, who are obligated to process transactions using proper
    business reasoning. Mediators have complete power of data protection and privacy.
    The confidence in Blockchain-based applications is decentralised. Users should
    only have faith in the mechanism and the smart code that is exchanged by all participants.
    Blockchain is a distributed blockchain that runs on a peer-to-peer network from
    a technological standpoint. Since any node in the network is on the same level
    as the others, this P2P network serves as the system's backbone. While nodes may
    take several different types, there is no central authority node. Per node keeps
    a copy of the Blockchain locally.
