    blockchain, this type of blockchain is centralized, with access provided only
    to a limited number of users. You might think of this category as a kind of customized

    people involved in cryptocurrency share. Eventually, even though 10 percent of

- en: 'I’m confident that in the future, smart contracts will be put into even broader
    use in the financial sector. I think this for a number of reasons. To go back
    to PwC: in PwC’s distributed accounting reports, there is now a thorough analysis
    of the future of blockchain and smart contracts. Since a smart contract is capable
    of self-executing contracts related to assets transfer, it, as a technology, definitely
    presents uses related to stock trading and other financial market trading.'

  zh: 我坚信，在未来，智能合约将在金融领域得到更广泛的应用。我之所以这样认为，有几个原因。回到普华永道的话题：在普华永道的分布式会计报告中，现在对区块链和智能合约的未来进行了彻底的分析。由于智能合约能够自动执行与资产转让相关的合同，作为一种技术，它肯定与股票交易和其他金融市场交易有关的使用。
- en: Another reason for the growth of smart contracts will be the growth of the Internet
    of Things (IoT). According to Gartner Inc., the global research firm, worldwide
    IoT security spending will reach $1.5 billion in 2018\. By 2021, it is expected
    to climb to $3.1 billion. Everything around us, including smartphones, cars, wearable
    products, and even furniture, is going to be connected to the Internet. This will
    create exponential data needs. What will we use to capture and store all of these
    new data? Blockchain.

  zh: 智能合约增长另一个原因将是物联网（IoT）的增长。根据Gartner Inc.，全球研究机构，全球物联网安全支出将在2018年达到18亿美元。到2021年，预计将增长到31亿美元。我们周围的每一件事，包括智能手机、汽车、可穿戴产品，甚至家具，都将与互联网相连。这将产生指数级的数据需求。我们将用什么来捕捉和存储所有这些新数据？区块链。
- en: Another trend in smart contracts’ favor is that blockchain is cost-efficient
    and friendly. In traditional law firms and auditing firms, adopting blockchain
    and smart contracts will significantly lower the cost of doing business and improve
    efficiency. It will be a win-win.

  zh: 对智能合约有利的另一个趋势是，区块链是成本效益高且友好的。在传统律师事务所和审计事务所，采用区块链和智能合约将显著降低做生意的成本并提高效率。这将是一种双赢的局面。

  zh: 首次币发行：泡沫还是额外奖励？
- en: Ethereum brought ICO to startups as a new way to raise capital. Ethereum announced
    its own ICO on September 2, 2014, and it placed among the top five of all time
    in terms of the sheer amount of capital it raised. Ethereum raised $18.4 million,
    most of which was spent developing Ethereum blockchain and related applications.
    (The record for “largest ICO” has been consistently broken. The EOS cryptocurrency’s
    token sales reached $4.1 billion over a one-year ICO, making it, for the moment,
    the number one ICO in history.)

  zh: 以太坊将首次币发行带入初创企业作为一种新的融资方式。以太坊在2014年9月2日宣布了自己的首次币发行，在筹集资金总额方面排名前五。以太坊筹集了1840万美元，其中大部分用于开发以太坊区块链和相关应用。（“最大首次币发行”的记录一直在被打破。EOS加密货币的代币销售在一年内达到了41亿美元，使其暂时成为历史上最大的首次币发行。）
- en: The evolution of ICOs has happened in two stages. In the early days, speculators
    who hoped to make fast money were always there to try to take advantage of the
    situation somehow. An ICO is, of course, not a Ponzi scheme, but rather a way
    for blockchain startups to raise money. But ICOs can be initiated by unsavory
    people who are only in it for quick profits at the expense of other people. These
    days, there is more awareness of this danger. However, in the early days of ICOs,
    token sales were always great, but some of them were being sold by scammers. In
    the second stage—the one we’re in now—as ICOs evolve into something more professional
    and transparent, they are attracting individuals and institutions from the traditional
    financial industry. There are advantages to this, yes, but it can also make things
    more standardized and slow things down. Blockchain, as an industry, is gathering
    experts and high-profile managers from across traditional industries and is improving
    every day and every hour.

  zh: 代币发行（ICO）的发展经历了两个阶段。在早期，总有一些希望快速赚钱的投机者试图利用某种情况从中获利。当然，ICO不是庞氏骗局，而是区块链初创公司筹集资金的一种方式。但是，ICO可以由那些只追求快速利润、损害他人利益的人发起。如今，对这种风险的认识越来越多。然而，在ICO的早期阶段，代币销售总是很受欢迎，但其中一些是由骗子销售的。在第二个阶段——我们现在所处的阶段——随着ICO变得更加专业和透明，它们正在吸引传统金融行业的个人和机构。这的确有优势，但它也可能使事情变得更加标准化，减缓进度。区块链作为一个行业，正在聚集来自传统行业的专家和高管，并且每天每小时都在进步。
- en: I believe that an ICO is soon going to be as accepted as an IPO is today. People
    make mistakes when they are young, and so do institutions. This was certainly
    true with ICOs. However, they have now become more consolidated and established.
    Launching an ICO is now as demanding as launching an IPO. It involves nearly everything
    that an IPO requires. Cryptocurrency and blockchain are interlinked so closely.
    Cryptocurrencies are supporting blockchain startups, and blockchain startups are
    relying on tokens to be issued and token sales to raise capital to grow bigger.
    At the same time, both are learning from traditional industries as well as bringing
    the latter more fully into the crypto economy.

  zh: 我相信，代币发行（ICO）很快就会像今天的首次公开募股（IPO）一样被接受。人们在年轻时会犯错误，机构也是。这在ICO上确实是真的。然而，现在它们已经变得更加稳定和成熟。发起ICO现在和发起IPO一样具有挑战性。它几乎包含了IPO所需的一切。加密货币与区块链紧密相连。加密货币支持区块链初创公司，而区块链初创公司依赖代币的发行和代币销售来筹集资金扩大规模。同时，它们也从传统行业学习，并将后者更全面地带入加密经济。
