    to freely express his or her thoughts, ideas or opinions orally, in writing or
    by any other form of expression, and to use for such purpose any means of communication
    and diffusion, and no censorship shall be established’. It also states that ‘Censorship
    restricting the ability of public officials to report on matters for which they
    are responsible is prohibited’. Despite these entrenched protections and formal

- en: Despite the rapid rise of the internet and social media, governments in China,
    Azerbaijan, Vietnam, Iran, Zimbabwe, and elsewhere are finding ways to use state-controlled
    media to help themselves stay in power. China’s central government has cracked
    down on press freedom as the country expands its international influence, but,
    in the internet age, many of its citizens hunger for a free flow of information.
    The Chinese government has long kept tight reins on both traditional and new media
    to avoid potential subversion of its authority. Its tactics often entail strict
    media controls using monitoring systems and firewalls, shuttering publications
    or websites, and jailing dissident journalists, bloggers, and activists [324].
    They achieve this through selective censorship of political expression and by
    using state media to influence crucial audiences. Although such censorship practices
    were traditionally aimed at broadcast and print media, the emergence of the internet
    and social media, in particular, prompted some authoritarian regimes, such as
    the Assad regime in Syria, to try to exert a similar level of censorship on the
    internet as well. During the Arab Spring, the Syrian regime blocked hundreds of
    websites that provided social networking, news, and other services. Taking Syria
    as a case study, media research indicates that internet censorship succeeded in
    preventing internet users from reaching censored online content during the Arab
    Spring of 2010–12\. Syrians fought back by using technology that circumvents website-blocking
    tools [325].

- en: In Zimbabwe, censorship is squarely aimed at poetry, songs, satire, and film.
    In 1967, the Rhodesian government crafted the Censorship and Entertainment Act
    to stifle dissenting black voices. This Act contains some very controversial sections
    which would make life difficult for all Zimbabweans. The Act also states that
    all radio stations and DJs in bars are supposed to send their music for approval
    24 hours before they play it, something that is practically impossible. In 1967,
    there was only one radio station and a few bars, but now, with more than eight
    radio stations directly linked to the state and more than a thousand bars in Harare
    alone, it is nightmarish to implement. As an instrument to suppress entertainment,
    the Act is outdated. It is out of sync with technological advancements. However,
    since independence, the Act has been used to control political plays and human
    rights artistic productions that may empower opposition and dissenters. In an
    act of blatant nepotism and cynical control, President Robert Mugabe’s daughter
    Bona Mugabe-Chikore was appointed in May 2017 to the Zimbabwean censorship board.
    The Board has been mandated to regulate the media, particularly to gag social
    media platforms ahead of next year’s general elections [326]. The appointment
    of a younger generation of Mugabes to enforce heavy censorship and smooth the

- en: Losing control of your content online is not just limited to other individuals
    using it without giving you credit. ‘Proof of Existence’ is an online service
    that incorporates blockchain. It involves content being certified and time stamped
    into the blockchain, providing a cryptographic record. It is a public record proving
    that you own the content without actually revealing the information or yourself.
    When you add the metadata of the content on the blockchain as well, it becomes
    possible to prove at any time that you were the original creator. These aspects
    of blockchain will lead to increased accuracy and overall confidence in online
    content.

- en: Truth, famously, is the first casualty of war and this is experienced daily
    in the troubled streets of Caracas. In Venezuela, the media have been under immense
    pressure for years, first under Hugo Chávez and now from the Maduro administration
    [329, 335]. Venezuelans describe their daily lives as confused and exhausted.
    A recent alleged attempted coup by a lone helicopter pilot dropping grenades was
    reported by some to be a government conspiracy—manipulated by Maduro to justify
    government oppression [336]. Conspiracy theories were fuelled by conflicting reports
    that the perpetrator was either ex-special forces or an aspiring actor, or both.
    Revelations of fake news about threats to the government and deaths of activists,
    and rumours that the first family is fleeing the country [337], and the military
    is mobilising against Maduro [338], only make a bad situation worse. As it is
