    sandy-haired, gimlet-eyed, he now flies Airbus 321s for American Airlines, and

    a day, he is necessarily concerned with maps, metrics, standards, and ground states.
    Acutely conscious of the correlations and deviations between maps and territories,

- en: Entrepreneurs, also “aloft in space and time,” depend on maps and metrics to
    guide their investments and companies. Space registers the geographical span of
    enterprise horizontally across the world; time projects the vertical dimension
    that takes the economy into the future. Money is a central metric to both, exchange
    rates mediating cross-border transactions, and interest rates guiding movement
    through time. When the signs and signals of time and space are muddled by government
    interventions or by arbitrary “caps” or controls, trade can founder, and the horizons
    of investment shrink in both dimensions.

    no sign of “peak gold.” The existing supply of 187 kilotons of gold is split evenly
    between financial and decorative uses. Any shortages will merely cause a shift

    in the nineteenth, have had a relatively small effect on prices. Accumulated supplies
    can shift between gold’s two main uses as money and jewelry. Money is liquid jewelry;
    jewelry is crystalized money. Raw bullion can be converted into baubles, and jewelry

    Imagine a world of barter. The rates of exchange between apples and houses, for

    in unfathomable patterns in time and space. To mediate the tradeoffs and priorities

- en: Who cares what happens in 2140, when Satoshi’s algorithm ordains a halt in bitcoin
    mining? I’m seventy-eight years old! We’re in a crisis now, with debt and other
    government liabilities mounting to over $100 trillion in the United States alone,
    bigger than the gross world product of $78 trillion, and with global debt at $257
    trillion. I deemed a slight deflationary bias a reasonable corrective to the engorgement
    of debt that currently afflicts the world economy, with debts piling up far beyond
    the growth rates of gross world product.

  zh: 谁会在 2140 年在乎会发生什么，当时 Satoshi 的算法规定停止比特币挖矿？我已经七十八岁了！我们现在正处于危机之中，债务和其他政府责任单单在美国就已经超过
    100 万亿美元，比全球 78 万亿美元的总生产总值还要大，全球债务达到 257 万亿美元。我认为略微的紧缩偏向是对目前困扰世界经济的债务膨胀的合理纠正，债务远远超过了全球生产总值的增长率。
- en: Confirming Forbes’s insight, however, Kendall demonstrated beyond cavil that
    bitcoin, as now constituted, cannot be a currency. Currencies create value by
    measuring it. The price of bitcoin changes with demand. You could respond that
    the price of the dollar also changes with demand. As I show in the Scandal of
    Money, that has been mostly true since 1971, and such fluctuations are the Achilles’
    heel of the dollar as a long-term currency.

  zh: 然而，肯德尔证明了福布斯的洞见，即现在的比特币构成的货币。货币通过衡量价值来创造价值。比特币的价格随着需求而变化。你可能会说美元的价格也随着需求而变化。正如我在《货币丑闻》中所示，自
    1971 年以来这大体上是正确的，这种波动是美元作为长期货币的致命弱点。
- en: “No other basic unit of measure,” says Kendall—whether it’s the second, the
    meter, the ampere, or the kilogram—“changes in value with demand. They are standards”
    based on physical constants. If money is a measuring stick, it cannot respond
    to demand.

  zh: “肯德尔说：没有其他基本计量单位——无论是秒、米、安培还是千克——会随着需求而价值变化。它们是基于物理常数的“标准”。如果货币是一个度量棒，它就不能对需求做出反应。
- en: “If bitcoin cannot fulfill the required roles of currency, its long-term utility
    as a currency is nil. . . . Bitcoin would disappear into the ether from which
    it came. . . . Because bitcoin has limited its supply to a fixed amount that is
    already mostly realized it will have a short shelf-life as a functional currency.”[⁸](notes.html#ch22note-8)
    Kendall points out that other cryptocurrencies are following in bitcoin’s deflationary
    footsteps with their mining algorithms.

  zh: “如果比特币无法履行货币的所需角色，那么它作为货币的长期实用性就为零……比特币将消失在它所来自的虚无之中……因为比特币已经将其供应限制在一个已经大部分实现的固定数量上，它将具有短暂的功能货币寿命。”[⁸](notes.html#ch22note-8)
    Kendall 指出，其他加密货币正跟随比特币的紧缩脚步与其采用的挖矿算法。
- en: Comparing their rates of issue, Kendall shows that bitcoin little resembles
    gold. If bitcoin mimicked the 1.6 percent rate of growth of gold production during
    the past one hundred years, the current number of bitcoins—16,651,130—would swell
    to 116 million units by Satoshi’s closing date in 2140, far more than his stipulated
    21 million. If bitcoin matched gold’s higher historical growth rate of 2.5 percent,
    it would reach 347,119,614 units. As Kendall concludes, the limit of 21 million
    total bitcoin units “is highly deflationary over time and unworkable.”

  zh: 比较它们的发行速度，Kendall 表明比特币很少像黄金。如果比特币模仿过去一百年黄金产量增长的 1.6% 的速度，目前的比特币数量——16,651,130——将在
    Satoshi 在 2140 年的结束日期达到 1.16 亿单位，远远超过他规定的 2,100 万。如果比特币达到黄金更高的历史增长率 2.5%，它将达到
    3.471,196,14 个单位。正如 Kendall 所总结的那样，总比特币单位的限制“随着时间的推移高度紧缩，并且不可行”。
- en: If people believe in the scheme, most of the world’s wealth might flow to bitcoin
    in periodic buying panics like the tulip mania, South Sea Bubble, and other derangements
    catalogued in 1841 by Charles Mackay in Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
    Madness of Crowds.[⁹](notes.html#ch22note-9) This outcome might be gratifying
    to current bitcoin holders, but it would obviously lead to government interventions,
    confiscations, crashes, and other reactions that would end this otherwise redemptive
    human project.

  zh: 如果人们相信这个方案，世界上大部分的财富可能会在周期性的购买恐慌中流向比特币，就像郁金香狂热、南海泡沫和其他 1841 年查尔斯·麦凯在《普及的荒谬和人群的疯狂》中记录的疯狂现象一样。这个结果可能会让当前的比特币持有者感到满意，但显然会引起政府的干预、没收、崩溃和其他反应，从而结束这个本应具有救赎意义的人类项目。
- en: Satoshi’s scheme is asymptotic with the time model of money, slowly stopping
    the passage of time and cutting it off in 2140\. That to Kendall is like removing
    the landing strip while he is in the air. Time, however, goes on forever at its
    unalterable pace.

  zh: Satoshi 的方案与货币时间模型渐近，慢慢地停止时间的流逝，并在 2140 年切断它。对 Kendall 来说，这就像在他空中飞行时移除着陆跑道一样。然而，时间以其不可改变的步伐永远继续前进。
- en: 'This bitcoin flaw represents a huge opportunity for other cryptocurrencies.
    But few of them to date—in the embryonic “stable coin” movement—reflect any notion
    of a currency as a measuring stick. Kendall observes: “Ether’s value is determined
    by its supply and demand, which is determined by its mining algorithms, which
    are determined by tech geeks without any real understanding of currency as a unit
    of account.” Vitalik Buterin should take notice.'

  zh: 这个比特币缺陷为其他加密货币提供了巨大的机会。但直到目前为止，很少有加密货币——在萌芽期的“稳定币”运动中——反映出货币作为衡量标准的任何概念。Kendall
    观察到：“以太币的价值取决于其供需，这由其采矿算法决定，而这些算法由对货币单位没有任何真正理解的技术极客决定。”Vitalik Buterin 应该注意到。
- en: Craig Wright still proclaims “bitcoin as the solution to everything.” He remains
    a “bitcoin maximalist.” But the fact is that bitcoin cannot fulfill its basic
    role as a currency. Its historical fate is to provide a haven from maniacal governments
