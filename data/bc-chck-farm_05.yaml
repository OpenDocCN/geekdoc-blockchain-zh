    and a vague shot at being able to escape poverty. As China’s P2P (peer-to-peer)
    lending scandals unfold, they show that investing and failure are markedly different

- en: Rice Harmony serves as a reminder of the humility in innovation, its ability
    to renew, to change political and social structures. Innovation is literally an
    ecosystem for Rice Harmony—an ecosystem that does not scale across thousands or
    millions of users but across the spectrum of time instead, regenerating the soil
    and community ties from one planting season to the next. For that, you don’t need
    VC funding, a legion of engineers, or millions of users.

  zh: 稻谷和谐作为创新中谦卑的提醒，它能够更新，改变政治和社会结构。创新实际上是稻谷和谐的生态系统——一个生态系统，不是跨越数千或数百万用户，而是跨越时间谱系，从一个种植季节到下一个季节再生土壤和社区联系。为此，你不需要风险投资基金，一大群工程师或数百万用户。
- en: I wander through the paddies, past the Frankenstein machines, past the piles
    of rice straw used as organic fertilizer. If innovation casts the spell of capitalism,
    in this mountain stronghold, I see *shanzhai* as a verb, used to cast a different
    kind of spell. To *shanzhai*. To turn protocols into practices that bind us together
    rather than centralize authority. To turn back the worship of scale and renew
    our commitments to care. I think back to the words I heard when I was a kid, the
    other magical phrase, *Made in China*, and the dismissive tone in the man’s voice.
    Barometers of success and innovation are invented by those with money, turning
    engagement into the surface-level interactions of informed users, rather than
    the deeper actions that tackle structural, social change by invested citizens
    willing to hold long village meetings. Entire entrepreneurship programs exist,
    funded by VCs, designed to foster what VCs see as the core values of innovation.
    Instead of continuing to accept success and innovation as empty containers, I
    propose new measures, understanding our world through *shanzhai*, through the
    ability to care, maintain, renew, and deepen commitments.

  zh: 我穿过稻田，经过弗兰肯斯坦式的机器，经过用作有机肥料的稻草堆。如果创新给资本主义施了魔法，那么在这个山中要塞，我把*山寨*看作是一个动词，用来施展不同类型的魔法。*山寨*。将协议转化为能够将我们联系在一起而不是将权力集中的实践。改变对规模的崇拜，重新承诺关怀。我回想起小时候听到的话语，另一个神奇的短语，*中国制造*，以及那个人嘲讽的语气。成功和创新的衡量标准是由有钱人发明的，将参与转化为受过教育的用户的表面层交互，而不是深入行动，通过投入的公民愿意举行长期村庄会议来解决结构性社会变革。整个创业项目都是存在的，由风险投资者资助，旨在培养风险投资者所认为的创新的核心价值观。我建议，与其继续接受成功和创新为空洞的容器，不如通过*山寨*，通过关心、维护、更新和加深承诺来理解我们的世界。
- en: I walk by a woman balancing a bucket on her head, off to feed chickens that
    help control pests. She whistles on her way up a mountain. A whole socioeconomic
    ecosystem stems from the technical farming infrastructure in this village. It
    makes me wonder what the parallel might be for our network infrastructure. And
    as scary as it might sound, to *shanzhai* the world will take time, as we confront
    our definitions of rationality, as we question intellectual property and what
    it means to exist meaningfully without boundaries of individual ownership. To
    *shanzhai* means we give up parts of our ego, rather than innovating a quick fix
    that scales to millions. After all, money and seed funds are finite, but time
    is long and ever passing, leaving us with more questions than answers.

  zh: 我经过一个头上顶着桶的女人，去喂鸡，而这些鸡又帮助控制害虫。她在上山的路上吹着口哨。整个社会经济生态系统源自于这个村庄的技术农业基础设施。这让我想知道我们的网络基础设施可能会有什么类似之处。尽管听起来可能有点可怕，但*山寨*世界需要时间，当我们面对我们对理性的定义时，当我们质疑知识产权及其在没有个人所有权限制下意义存在的含义。*山寨*意味着我们放弃自我部分，而不是创新一个能够扩展到成百万人的快速解决方案。毕竟，金钱和种子基金是有限的，而时间是长久且不断流逝的，留下的是更多问题而不是答案。
