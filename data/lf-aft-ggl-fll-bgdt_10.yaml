    and Mike Gibson and partly financed by Peter Thiel.

- en: With a combination of thoughtful authority and seemingly boundless energy reminiscent
    of Thiel himself, Strachman and Gibson ran the Thiel Fellowship for its first
    five years. Founded in 2011 to pluck young people from the cradle of credentialism,
    the Fellowship induces students in their early twenties or below to “skip or stop
    out of college.” While they work on their own “unique project, they receive a
    [two-year] $100,000 grant and support from the Thiel Foundation’s network of founders,
    investors, and scientists.”[¹](notes.html#ch10note-1)

  zh: 携带着细致的权威和仿佛不可限量的能量，令人联想到锡尔本人，斯特拉赫曼和吉布森在五年里运营了**锡尔基金会奖学金**。这个奖学金成立于2011年，旨在从证书主义的摇篮中挑选年轻人，诱导20多岁或更年轻的学生“跳过或中断大学”。在他们自己的“独特项目”上工作时，他们将获得一笔[两年期]10万美元的资助，并得到锡尔基金会创始人、投资者和科学家的支持。
- en: Strachman’s and Gibson’s modest goal for 1517 was to help a new generation of
    technologists reshape the incumbent system of the world. Birthed in the fogs of
    Stanford, hosted in the clouds of Google, and aiming at superhuman artificial
    intelligence, that system exalts academic honors, all-purpose Turing machines,
    software supremacy, open-source modularity, and secret-sauce integration. But
    do you really trust this system to handle your money, motivate your children,
    shape your worldview, or maneuver your car through a crowded parking lot?

- en: The bearded libertarian Gibson was working at Thiel’s Clarium Capital in 2010
    when he learned that his boss was launching an “anti–Rhodes Scholarship.” “Sign
    me up,” Gibson said. Post-graduate fellowships for Americans and other colonials
    to get polished at Oxford, Rhodes Scholarships are the ultimate establishment
    honor. They tend to produce politicians like Bill Bradley, media celebrities such
    as Rachel Maddow, and academics rather than entrepreneurs.

- en: Strachman, an advocate of “project-based learning,” had previously started a
    charter school in San Diego. She already believed that many students could learn
    far more starting their own companies than sitting in classrooms. When she heard
    about the Thiel Fellowship, originally called “20 under 20,” she joined Gibson
    there. They picked their first group of twenty under twenty in 2011\. The next
    year an eighteen-year-old freshman at Canada’s University of Waterloo, Vitalik
    Buterin, applied.

    Buterin申请了奖学金。
- en: The Thiel team found Buterin’s project, an innovation in digital education,
    unimpressive. “At the outset,” says Strachman, “we were seeing lots of education
    projects; his didn’t stand out.” They passed him over, and he didn’t reapply.

    Olah，一个十九岁的图形设计高手。
- en: In 2013, Olah brought Buterin, just shy of twenty, to the big “Hack the North”
    software jam session, held every September at Waterloo, where he met Strachman
    and Gibson. In his upward-inflecting, faintly lisping tones, Buterin told them
    that since his application, he had changed course a bit, having fallen in love
    with “this cryptographic construction called a blockchain.” He had devoted himself
    to studying its possibilities, using the bitcoins he’d earned from founding Bitcoin
    Magazine to travel the world from Israel to Las Vegas to Amsterdam, talking with
    other blockchain obsessives. Realizing that “crypto projects were taking up thirty
    hours per week of my time,” he dropped out of university in April 2013.[²](notes.html#ch10note-2)

- en: In the Waterloo meeting with Strachman and Gibson, his last chance to get their
    attention before he transgressed into his over-the-hill twenties, Buterin proposed
    to revolutionize the Internet and the global financial system. “That’s what Peter
    Thiel wanted, right?” As he recited a litany of ambitiously cockeyed schemes—“Turing-complete”
    blockchains, new software languages, currencies, computer platforms, smart contracts—Strachman
    and Gibson could see that he was a genius. But his grandiosity and apparent lack
    of focus defied all the rules of successful enterprise.

- en: They decided to support him anyway. In November 2013, Buterin wrote the Ethereum
    white paper, and on June 5, 2014, Peter Thiel announced a new group of twenty
    Thiel Fellows, which included Buterin. A year later, Ethereum went live, with
    the announcement, “What bitcoin does for payments, Ethereum does for anything
    that can be programmed.” It was another step in the decentralization of the Internet.

    31, 1517\. That was the day that Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses on
    the church door at Wittenberg. Among the abuses Luther was protesting was the
    selling of indulgences. The remission of the temporal penalty due to sins, an
    indulgence, like other spiritual goods, must not be sold. The pardoners who perpetrated
    this abuse would issue a document memorializing the transaction. The 1517 Fund
    explains the parallel: “Likewise, universities today are selling a piece of paper
    at great cost and telling people that buying it is the only way they can save
    their souls. Universities call it a diploma, and they’re making a fortune doing
    it. Call us heretical if you like, but the 1517 Fund is dedicated to dispelling
    that paper illusion.”[³](notes.html#ch10note-3)'

    基金解释了这种类比：“同样，今天的大学正在以巨大的代价出售一张纸，并告诉人们购买它是他们拯救灵魂的唯一方式。大学称之为文凭，他们靠这样做发了一笔财。如果你愿意的话，可以称我们为异端，但
    1517 基金致力于消除那种纸张幻觉。”

    fortune, died in 2014, his collection of 220 rare and exotic tanks—“enough mechanized
    weaponry to invade a small country” as the San Jose Mercury News reported at the
    time—was auctioned off.[⁴](notes.html#ch10note-4) What remained at his ranch was

    and 2013 Thiel Fellow. At the time of the 1517 Fund’s annual meeting in 2017,
    Luminar had 250 employees in Silicon Valley and Orlando, Florida, and was adding
    a new chip design facility in Colorado. About to emerge from five years of “deep

- en: Looking at Google’s Waymo, Elon Musk’s Tesla, Levandowsky’s Uber scheme, and
    the host of imitator “autonomy” projects, Russell sees over-hyped schemes that
    cannot ultimately succeed. They can sue each other all they want, but the approach
    of the most highly vaunted ventures is to try to enhance the existing lidar, radar,
    and camera systems with artificial intelligence, big data, mapping, and software.
    Russell, who spent his boyhood preoccupied with optics, lasers, and machine vision,
    understands that no amount of big data can make up for bad data from hopelessly
    inadequate vision systems.

- en: Lidar (light detection and ranging) is how vehicles see and evaluate the world
    around them. Russell understood from the outset that if the car cannot deliver
    an utterly reliable real-time image and interpretation of the road ahead for at
    least two hundred meters in the dark, with just 10 percent reflectivity, it is
    a death-trap. Two hundred meters give a car seven seconds to react, compared with
    the one or two seconds afforded by existing systems, if they can register the
    objects at all.

  zh: Lidar（光探测与测距）是车辆看到和评估周围世界的方式。从一开始，罗素就明白，如果汽车在黑暗中不能提供至少两百米的绝对可靠的实时图像和解释，而且反射率只有10％，那么它就是一个死亡陷阱。两百米给了汽车七秒钟的反应时间，而现有系统只能提供一到两秒的时间，如果它们能够注册物体的话。
- en: Such systems are worse than useless, Russell thinks, because they produce an
    illusion of success by meeting the low-cost targets and performance specs hyped
    by the industry. Like Google’s Waymo vehicles, they could perform adequately on
    repetitive twenty-five-mile-an-hour commutes from Silicon Valley to San Francisco.
    Answering Elon Musk’s complaints about regulation, Russell said prophetically
    in early 2017, “The real threat is premature launch of systems that end up killing
    people and killing the industry.” He added, “For existing technology, it may even

- en: To Russell, it is obvious that autonomy is not chiefly a software problem. Most
    existing software will have to be changed anyway to adapt to faster and better
    lidar systems. Much of the work already done by Waymo and others will have to

    modularity.” When a product fundamentally underperforms the market’s requirements,
    integration is essential. You can’t just go down to Fry’s and cobble together

- en: To Russell, it is obvious that current self-driving vision systems are nowhere
    near the level the market requires. As bad as human drivers are, the self-driving
    systems of 2017 had to be turned off or augmented far more often than human drivers
    failed. The best record by far is Google’s Waymo, but it has to be disengaged
    every 5,500 miles or so, compared with nearly 500,000 miles for human drivers
    between accidents and 84.6 million miles per fatality. Tesla has to be turned
    off every three miles. Sure, these systems will get better with time. But they’re
    nowhere close to where they need to be. Although you would never know it by listening
    to the promotional literature, the existing vision systems cannot collect enough
    good data fast enough. Fancy software just gilds that rotating sow’s ear on the

    entirely new integrated systems with at least fiftyfold more resolution and tenfold
    more range than the prevailing standard. Russell’s technology targets were not

    a system that kills people. Aim at performance, and low cost will follow. Aim

- en: A crucial decision was to reject a wavelength of light preferred by his rivals—905
    nanometers—which is close to the visible spectrum and can simulate what can be
    seen by human eyes. Unfortunately, the 905 nanometer near-infrared also can affect
    human eyes. So Russell moved deeper into the infrared band to 1,550 nanometers
    (153 terahertz), which is employed in fiber optics. The longer wavelength can
    be used at sixtyfold greater power levels without endangering human beings. Russell
    and the team also radically changed the architecture. Rather than using scores
    of lasers, they raster-scan the scene thousands of times a second with a single

  zh: 一个关键的决定是拒绝他的竞争对手更喜欢的 905 纳米的光波长，这接近可见光谱并可以模拟人眼所见的东西。不幸的是，905 纳米近红外光也会影响人眼。所以拉塞尔将光谱向更深的红外波段移动到
    1550 纳米（153 太赫兹），这在光纤中使用。更长的波长可以以六十倍的功率水平使用而不危及人类。拉塞尔和团队还从根本上改变了架构。他们不使用数十个激光器，而是用单一激光器以像阴极射线管电视设备一样，将场景进行数千次的栅格扫描。
- en: Rather than separating the vision systems from the interpretive processing,
    they integrated them, as human vision systems do. Throwing out silicon and adopting
    an exotic high-performance alloy, indium gallium arsenide, for their chips allowed
    them to implant the lasers directly on the same substrate as the computational
    element.

  zh: 他们并没有将视觉系统与解释处理分开，而是将它们集成起来，就像人类视觉系统一样。抛弃硅并采用一种高性能的外来合金——铟镓砷化物，用于他们的芯片，使他们能够将激光直接植入到与计算元件相同的基板上。
- en: All the other companies link their sensor systems and their processor technology
    with three-thousand-dollar analog-to-digital converters. Luminar produced a microchip
    “eye” coupled to the processor that resolves the image, sampling the road hundreds
    of thousands of times a second. Now on its seventh-generation application-specific
    integrated circuit (ASIC) design, Luminar has a fully integrated technology stack.
    It is manufactured exclusively by the company and its specialist foundry partner,
    TowerJazz Semiconductor. Headquartered in Israel and headed by the visionary entrepreneur
    Russell Ellwanger, TowerJazz happens to run a world-beating analog-digital fabrication
    facility (a “fab”) in Austin Russell’s hometown of Newport Beach. After making
    a few score working systems that outperformed existing lidar roughly fiftyfold,
    Luminar committed to producing ten thousand units of working systems in 2018.

    的第七代专用集成电路（ASIC）设计具有完全集成的技术堆栈。它由该公司及其专业铸造合作伙伴 TowerJazz Semiconductor 独家制造。总部位于以色列，由有远见的企业家
    Russell Ellwanger 领导，TowerJazz 恰好在奥斯汀·拉塞尔的故乡纽波特比奇设有世界领先的模拟-数字制造设施（“工厂”）。在制造了几十个性能比现有激光雷达大约提高五十倍的工作系统后，Luminar
    承诺在 2018 年生产一万台工作系统。
- en: 1517’s Strachman stresses the importance of cultivating an entrepreneurial community.
    After becoming a Thiel Fellow in 2013, Russell found his community. He moved into
    216 Park Lane, a stucco mansion on a palmy drive in Atherton, a few miles north
    of Stanford. While real estate agents tried to sell the property for ten million
    dollars in the wake of the “Great Recession,” the eighteen-year-old Californian
    rented the secluded space with two other youths engaged with the Thiel program—the
    twenty-three-year-old Vermonter Stephen Balaban, a graduate of the University
    of Michigan, and the seventeen-year-old Thomas Sohmers, from Massachusetts. The
    trio looked an entrepreneurial version of the Hardy Boys, heroes of the classic
    mystery books—with Russell as the tall, ping-pong-playing, blond Joe Hardy; Balaban
    as his dark-haired intellectual martial-artist older brother, Frank Hardy; and
    Sohmers as Chet Morton, their slightly chubby friend whose tinkering and inventions
    often save the day.

  zh: 1517 的 Strachman 强调了培育企业家社区的重要性。成为 2013 年 Thiel Fellow 后，Russell 找到了他的社区。他搬进了位于斯坦福大学以北几英里处
    Atherton 的棕榈大道上的 216 Park Lane，这是一座灰泥别墅。在“大衰退”后，房地产经纪人试图以一千万美元的价格出售该物业，但这位十八岁的加利福尼亚人与其他两名从事
    Thiel 计划的青年租下了这个隐蔽的空间——二十三岁的佛蒙特州人 Stephen Balaban，他是密歇根大学的毕业生，以及十七岁的 Thomas Sohmers，来自马萨诸塞州。这三人看起来像是创业版的《哈代兄弟》（Hardy
    Boys）——Russell 是高个子、打乒乓球、金发的 Joe Hardy；Balaban 是他黑发的、智力超群的武术家兄长 Frank Hardy；而
    Sohmers 则是他们微胖的朋友 Chet Morton，他的修补和发明经常拯救了一天。
- en: Sohmers, like Russell, was a 2013 Thiel Fellow, but while Russell had made it
    to Stanford before dropping out, Sohmers had left his science-focused high school
    as a junior. Thanks to his silicon-trap mind, though, he was soon at Stanford
    anyway, not as a student but as an expert brought in to teach Russell’s ex-classmates.
    He had started his REX Computing company at sixteen, aiming at overthrowing prevailing
    chip architectures that waste most of their energy in “wait-states” and wires
    connecting to memory.

  zh: Sohmers，像 Russell 一样，是 2013 年的 Thiel Fellow，但是 Russell 在辍学前已经进入了斯坦福，而 Sohmers
    则在高中二年级离开了他的以科学为重点的高中。然而，由于他的硅陷阱思维，他很快就进入了斯坦福，但不是作为学生，而是作为一个专家被带来教导 Russell 的前同学。他在十六岁时就开始了他的
    REX Computing 公司，旨在推翻浪费大部分能量在“等待状态”和连接到内存的导线中的主流芯片架构。
- en: Disgusted with the departure of silicon from Silicon Valley, Sohmers saw many
    paths for reviving the industry. He focused on inventions that moved the prevailing
    chip designs toward the zero-power end of Tredennick’s “leading-edge-wedge.” Low
    power is imperative in an age of mobility serving the mobility of human minds
    and bodies.

  zh: 对硅谷软件的离开感到厌恶的 Sohmers 看到了重振该行业的许多途径。他专注于将主流芯片设计朝着 Tredennick 的“领先边缘楔子”的零功耗端移动的发明。在服务人类思维和身体的移动性的时代，低功耗至关重要。
- en: Balaban, the oldest member of the trio, was still almost as precocious as Russell
    and Sohmers. Like Buterin, he was fluent in Mandarin and software. But he missed
    out on a possible Thiel Fellowship when he went to Beijing instead to start a
    “Y-Combinator” incubator fund.

    Thiel Fellowship 机会。
