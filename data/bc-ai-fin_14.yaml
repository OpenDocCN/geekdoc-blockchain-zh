    On the one hand it is important for industry actors to have clear frameworks and
    guidelines within which they can operate, and several professional associations
    and advocacy groups have taken leadership in attempting to define and clarify
    what exactly those guidelines should be. This somewhat interesting and contradictory
    view, of industry actors and players seeking our increased regulation and oversight,
    actually makes perfect sense when a broader perspective is utilized. Specifically,
    and as different organizations continue to make investments on both blockchain
    sides or individual cryptocurrencies it is important to make sure that these investments,
    ideally, do not end up being contrary to what the regulators end up instituting
    as the rules of the marketplace (Corson [2016](#CR2)). From a financial systems
    and markets perspective and point of view, ensuring that the products and services
    instituted by a variety of firms remain in compliance with market movements and
    trends is important. Practitioners, in addition to the work and effort involved

    example, Goldman Sachs – a venerable financial institution in its own right with
    historic ties to traditional financial centers (including New York City) has recently
    opened an office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Driven by a variety of forces, including
    the talent that exists in that local market as well as the lower costs that can
    be obtained in Utah, this office has been the fastest growing office for years

- en: From a legalistic perspective, a decentralized organization still remains something
    of an anomaly in terms of how it should be classified and treated. As of this
    writing a purely decentralized organization is not formally recognized as a legal
    model in and of itself, but is most closely affiliated with the model of a general
    partnership, which may or may also impact various corporate governance and voting
    policies (Syeed [2018](#CR7)). Depending on the specifics of just how the organization
    is structured, and the types of tokens that are issued during the formation of
    the company, a general partnership agreement and operating structure is a logical
    choice. For those financial professionals not intimately familiar with the workings
    of the legal system this might not seem like an extremely important piece of information,
    but can have potentially disastrous consequences for investors. If, for example,
    individuals or investment funds have participated in ICOs, STOs, or other types
    of fundraising activities connected to blockchain based business models they may
    have inadvertently be exposing themselves to unlimited liability depending on
    the operations of the business. This often unaddressed fact or piece of information
    is something that has not been discussed all that much even during the hype and
    excitement related to the ICO and STO marketplace. Specifically from a regulatory
    perspective it is important to understanding that technology and regulatory approaches
    tend to not only interact with each other, but influence each other as the ecosystem
    continues to evolve and mature (Gump and Leonard [2016](#CR5)). Fortunately, there
    does appear to be a solution that might be able to lawyers and financial professionals
    advise clients; the segregated limited liability corporation (SLLC).

    [2018](#CR7)）。根据组织的具体结构以及在公司形成过程中发行的代币的类型，普通合伙协议和运营结构是一个合乎逻辑的选择。对于那些对法律体系运作不太熟悉的金融专业人士来说，这可能看起来并不是非常重要的信息，但对投资者来说可能会造成潜在灾难性的后果。例如，如果个人或投资基金参与了与基于区块链的商业模式相关的ICO、STO或其他类型的筹款活动，他们可能会在业务运作中无意中使自己面临无限责任。即使在ICO和STO市场的热烈和激动引起轰动时，这个往往被忽视的事实或信息也并没有被深入讨论。特别是从监管的角度来看，重要的是要了解技术和监管方法不仅相互作用，而且随着生态系统的不断发展和成熟而相互影响（Gump

    Facebook enter the blockchain financial services space, it does not appear illogical
    to conclude that blockchain is rapidly becoming a hot and timely topic in the
    banking and financial services space (Yu [2016](#CR9)). The advent and integration

    and information from other information. How this might work, for example, is that
    by segregating the piece of data and information stored and managed via a decentralized
    and distributed business model, such a separation may result in limited liability
    for different stakeholders and token holders. If, as a result of issuing a security
    token – as defined by the SEC during 2018 and 2019 – results in token holders
    having shared or the profits and operations of the organization, this is not an
    academic question given the scope of business being conducted in such a manner.
    Billions have been raised via ICOs and STOs during the excitement and buzz around

- en: On top of the legal issues and considerations that must be factored into the
    conversation and debate there is also a fiduciary responsibility that financial
    professionals must be aware of as decentralized organizations continue to proliferate
    (van Rijswijk et al. [2019](#CR8)). Clients, both individual and institutional
    in nature, may be interested in participating in, investing in, and even leading
    a decentralized structure itself. One of the first decentralized organizations,
    theDAO, offers a perfect example of what can occur is risks and associated potential
    liabilities are not accounted for appropriately. Running, like the vast majority
    of decentralized blockchain models, on the Ethereum blockchains, this organization
    had raised in excess of $150 million USD during the early days of the blockchain
    industry. Revealing a potential fatal flaw in the decentralized and distributed
    model of blockchain itself the code that underpinning the DAO was hacked and manipulated
    which, in essence, led to members of theDAO being locked out of the organization
    itself. After a manual intervention by the founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin,
    the situation was ultimately resolved, but no without the loss of financial resources,
    reputational damage, and shaking of faith in the idea of decentralized blockchain
    model at large. These fiduciary implications and associated risks that can accompany

- en: Something that is becoming more of a mainstream topic for professionals to debate,
    especially in terms of market applications, is how ethical decision making and
    ethics in general can be integrated within AI programs. At the current pace of
    development, many industry and computer experts speculate that AI programs that
    are either self aware or able to act of their own volition are mere years away.
    Compounding this potential it is also logical to acknowledge that AI – or other
    automation programs – are driving and handling large amounts of the decision making
    process. Credit card approvals, transaction processing, stock trading, journal
    entry posting and reconciliations, and other financial analysis procedures are
    already in large part automated or at least partially automated. Let’s take a
    look at an example that financial advisors and market makes need to certainly
    keep an eye as these trends continue to become more prominent. Certain investors
    or classes of investors may, for a variety of reasons, want to only invest in
    companies aligned with certain ESG goals and objectives. Even those this preference
    may be expressed and programmed into investing programs and algorithms, there
    is still going to be a need for human oversight and control. Investing decisions
    are certainly high profile enough by themselves, but that is not the only area
    in which ethics needs to be integrated into the business decision making process.

    credit to creditworthy customers and organizations is a function and process that
    provide vital services to the broader economy at large, and is something that
    is important for all practitioners to be aware of as technology becomes increasingly
    integrated into how business is conducted. During the Great Recession of 2008,
    for example, was precipitated and prolonged by the fact that the lending market
    connected to the extension of credit had dried up, depriving organizations and
    individuals or much needed capital and resources. Returning to the idea of business
    formation and creation, the primary reason why most new small businesses fail
    is due to lack of capital and financing; being able to make timely and effective
    decisions connected to these needs is something that is incredibly important.

  zh: 首先，金融专业人士通常被分配需要大量手动时间和精力的任务，例如确认信息，验证数据准确性，并确保将正确类型的信息传递给合适的最终用户。这些任务虽然耗时，却构成了许多公司传统成功商业模式的基础，但似乎并未辅助其他管理专业人士以前瞻性方式做决策。随着人工智能和区块链在任何最终被个人组织采纳的阶段变得更加主流，从业者应能利用这些工具将低级工作替换为更高级的流程。其次，对金融服务专业人士减少在历史分析上的时间构成重大障碍的问题是确保历史信息的准确性和完整性至关重要。无论是与证券交易委员会报告、用于报税目的的报告，还是提供给外部债权人的财务报表有关，经常落在金融服务团队的责任范围内，来确保信息的准确性。虽然这样的工作从监管和法律角度显然很重要，但它占用了时间和精力，否则本可以用于更具前瞻性和战略性的工作。
- en: Third, and perhaps most difficult to overcome is the reluctance some in the
    financial services space of innovation, creativity, and doing things different
    than had been previously acceptable. Such as lack of creativity may, of course,
    be grounded in a significant amount of truth and historical precedent. After all,
    some of the most profound failures, bankruptcies, and scandals linked to the financial
    services segment of the economy have been tied to individuals and organizations
    using something akin to creative finance. That said, simply because previous unethical
    actors had conducted themselves in an unethical manner does not mean the innovation
    or approaching topics in news ways should be ignored. Rather, and something at
    the core of this book, is that innovation and creativity in the profession are
    items to embrace, and to leverage with the advances available due to technological
    advancement.

  zh: '第三，也许最难克服的是金融服务领域一些人对创新、创造力和做事与先前可接受的方式不同的抵触情绪。这种缺乏创造力可能当然是建立在大量真相和历史先例之上的。毕竟，与经济的金融服务部门相关的一些最严重的失败、破产和丑闻是由个人和组织使用类似创造性金融的方式导致的。也就是说，仅仅因为之前的不道德行为者以不道德的方式行事，这并不意味着创新或以新的方式处理问题应该被忽视。相反，这本书的核心之一是，应该拥抱该行业中的创新和创造力，并利用由于技术进步而可用的进步。 '
- en: As technology and automation becomes increasingly integrated within the accounting
    and broader financial services landscape it is also important to take into account
    the opportunities that are generated and created through automation, the streamlining
    of operations, and the implementation of technology solutions throughout the decision
    making process. Financial services professionals will, almost without a doubt,
    be impacted by the increased automation, digitization, and technological forces
    in the broader business landscape, but it is also something that can, and should,
    generate opportunities for financial services professionals.

    may obtain a large amount of headlines and news information, the interpretation
    of this information remains an obstacle and challenge to many individuals within
    the accounting and finance profession. Building on prior competencies and skillsets
    embedded within the profession, financial services professionals are well equipped
    to add value in an increasingly digitized and mobile first environment.

    professional services landscape is the forward looking ability these tools will
    provide to individuals. One of the core issues and complaints, from a client and

    the automation and streamlining of accounting and finance professions will become
    a powerful force in the marketplace, that the internal control perspective will
    otherwise become important. Maintaining a robust control environment, especially
    as the speed with which transactions and entries can be processed will only increase,
    represents a core role and responsibility that financial professionals must evolve

  zh: 第12章概要
- en: Chapter [12](467992_1_En_12_Chapter.xhtml) analyzes some of the most important
    ideas and topics for financial services professionals seeking to implement emerging
    technology. Although blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotic process automation,
    and other technology trends may be difficult to analyze from an implementation
    and application perspective it is important for practitioners to remain aware
    of the trends and directions underway in the space. At virtually every accounting
    or finance conference or event the topics and content associated with emerging
    technology tools is also accompanied by predictions of job losses, displacement,
    and erosion or market position. It is important to understand that technology
    trends and automation will result in a changing business landscape, but will also
    create opportunities and openings for forward looking professionals. Taking an
    objective viewpoint and perspective on the implication of emerging technology
    is important from both a practice management point of view as well as the ability
    of professionals to offer advice and guidance to different clients moving forward.
    Understanding both the technology trends itself, as well as the implications these
    trends will have on accounting and finance overall are important facts and trends
    for every practitioner working within the space to remain aware of as these technologies
    become more mainstream. Technologies may change in terms of labels and acronyms,
    but the forces and impacts on the professionals landscape will continue to evolve
    and should be incorporated into the business decision making process across industry
    lines going forward.
