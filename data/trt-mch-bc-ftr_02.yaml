    and governments that have for centuries been the guardians of our financial systems.

    people could keep track of the exchanges. It wasn’t so difficult for everyone
    in a small village to remember that someone had killed a pig and to trust—a word
    we’ll encounter throughout this book—that all who ate of it would find some way
    to later repay the hunter, perhaps with a new arrowhead or some other thing of
    value. It was another to manage these cross-societal obligations across a larger
    group of strangers—especially when moving outside of kinship boundaries made it
    harder to trust each other. Ledgers are record-keeping devices that help deal
    with those problems of complexity and trust. They help us keep track of all the
    multiple exchanges upon which society is built. Without them, the giant, teeming
    cities of twenty-first-century society would not exist. That said, ledgers are
    not truth itself—not in an absolute sense—for when it comes to matters of value,
    an element of judgment and estimation is always present in the recording process.
    Rather, they are tools for getting closer to the truth, to an approximation of
    it that’s acceptable to all. Problems arise when communities view them with absolute
    faith, especially when the ledger is under control of self-interested actors who
    can manipulate them. This is what happened in 2008 when insufficient scrutiny

    least two banks, one or two payment processors, a card network manager (such as
    Visa or Mastercard), and a variety of other institutions, depending on where the
    transaction takes place. Each entity in that system maintains its own separate
    ledger, which it later must reconcile with every other entity’s independent records,
    a process that takes time, incurs costs, and carries risks. Whereas you might
    think that money is being instantly transferred when you swipe your card at a
    clothing store, in reality the whole process takes several days for the funds
    to make all those hops and finally settle in the storeowner’s account, a delay
    that creates risks and costs. With Bitcoin, the idea is that your transaction
    should take only ten to sixty minutes to fully clear (notwithstanding some current

    supposed to be used to raise short-term capital, not hide debt. When it came time
    to report, the company didn’t appear to be overly indebted. Once the report was
    in, the company brought the debt back on the books. Really, it was as if the company
    was maintaining two sets of books—one it showed the public, one it kept private.
    Most people accepted what was reported in the public-facing books, Lehman’s version
    of “the truth.” Just how severely skewed Lehman’s books were would become clear
    in September 2008\. But the problem really started with the public’s trust, in
    the blind faith given to the company’s numbers. And that problem—quite literally
    one of faith—goes way, way back.

    to lending before double-entry booking came along. The ancients were pretty comfortable
    with debt. The Babylonians set the tone in the famous Code of Hammurabi, which
    offered rules for handling loans, debts, and repayments. The Judeo-Christian tradition,
    though, had a real ax to grind against the business of lending. “Thou shalt not
    lend upon usury to thy brother,” Deuteronomy 23:19–20 declares. “In thee have
    they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast
    greedily gained of thy neighbors by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the
    Lord God,” Ezekiel 22:12 states. As Christianity flourished, this deep anti-usury
    culture continued for more than a thousand years, a stance that coincided with
    the Dark Ages, when Europe, having lost the glories of ancient Greece and Rome,
    also lost nearly all comprehension of math. The only people who really needed

    merchants simply couldn’t calculate the things we take for granted today; he taught

    little more than an educated guess. Modern accounting, especially at the big,
    international banks, has become so convoluted that it is virtually useless. In
    a comprehensive dissection in 2014, the Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine explained
    how a bank’s balance sheet is almost impossibly opaque. The “value” of a large
    portion of the assets on that balance sheet, he noted, is simply based on guesses
    made by the bank about the collectability of the loans they make, or of the bonds
    they hold, and the prices that they might fetch on the market, all measured against
    the offsetting and equally fuzzy valuation of their liabilities and obligations.
    If a guess is off by even 1 percent, it can turn a quarterly profit into a loss.
    Guessing whether a bank is actually profitable is like a pop quiz. “I submit to
    you that there is no answer to the quiz,” he wrote. “It is not possible for a
    human to know whether Bank of America made money or lost money last quarter.”
    A bank’s balance sheet, he said, is essentially a series of “reasonable guesses

    a science that dates way back to ancient times, when coded language to share “ciphers,”
    or secrets, first arose. Ever since Alan Turing’s calculating machine cracked
    the German military’s Enigma code, cryptography has underpinned much of what we’ve
    done in the computing age. Without it we wouldn’t be able to share private information
    across the Internet—such as our transactions within a bank’s Web site—without
    revealing it to unwanted prying eyes. As our computing capacity has exponentially
    grown, so too has the capacity of cryptography to impact our lives. For his part,
    Grigg believed it would lead to a programmable record-keeping system that would
    make fraud virtually impossible. In a nutshell, the concept took the existing,
    double-entry bookkeeping system and added a third book: the independent, open

    but added to these digitized books would be another function, essentially a time
    stamp, a cryptographically secured, signed receipt of every transaction. (The
    concept of a “signature” in cryptography means something far more scientific than
    a handwritten scrawl; it entails combining two associated numbers, or “keys”—one
    publicly known, the other private—to mathematically prove that the entity making
    the signature is uniquely authorized to do so.) Grigg envisioned his triple-entry
    accounting as a software program that would run within, say, a large company or
    organization. But the third ledger, containing the sequence of all those signed
    receipts, could be verified publicly, and in real time. Any deviation from its
    time-stamped records would be an indication of a fraud. Picture a fraud like Bernie
    Madoff’s, in which Madoff was simply making up transactions and recording them

    chapters to come. Szabo, Grigg, and others pioneered an approach with the potential
    to create a record of history that cannot be changed—a record that someone like

- en: 'Also, the results should be collated using the hard-to-crack math of cryptography,
    which prevents them from ever being overwritten in the future. Here’s how cryptography
    can achieve what it does: it uses data-protecting codes drawn from a set of possible
    numbers so large that it’s far, far beyond human imagination. The sheer quantity
    of possibilities makes it impossibly time-consuming to discover the hidden code
    through “brute force” guesswork—in other words, by testing and discarding each
    possible number. Consider that Bitcoin is now the most powerful computing network
    in the world, one whose combined “hashing” rate as of August 2017 enabled all
    its computers to collectively pore through 7 million trillion different number
    guesses per second. Well, it would still take that network around 4,500 trillion
    trillion trillion years to work through all the possible numbers that could be
    generated by the SHA-256 hashing algorithm that protects Bitcoin’s data. Let the
    record show that period of time is 36,264 trillion trillion times longer than
    the current best-estimate age of the universe. Bitcoin’s cryptography is pretty
    secure.[*](footnote.xhtml#footnote-17991-2)'

  zh: 此外，还应该使用难以破解的密码学数学汇总结果，这样可以防止它们在未来被覆写。密码学是如何实现这一点的呢？它使用了一组可能性极其巨大的数字来保护数据，以至于远远超出人类的想象力。如此庞大的可能性使得通过“蛮力”猜测难以发现隐藏的代码
    — 换句话说，通过测试和丢弃每个可能的数字来发现。想想看，比特币现在是世界上最强大的计算网络，其“散列”速率结合起来使其所有计算机每秒能够共同处理7000万亿个不同的数字猜测。嗯，即使是这个网络，也需要大约4,500万亿亿亿年的时间才能处理比特币数据的SHA-256散列算法生成的所有可能数字。让记录显示，这段时间是目前宇宙的最佳估计年龄的36,264万亿亿倍长。比特币的密码学相当安全。[*](footnote.xhtml#footnote-17991-2)
- en: Yet this system of honest accounting still needs something more than cryptography
    to work. It needs to open up its sequenced record of traceable, interlinked transactions
    to public scrutiny. This means that (1) the ledger should be public, and (2) the
    algorithm that runs it should adhere to open-source principles, with its source
    code on view for all to see and test.

  zh: 然而，这种诚实会计系统仍然需要比密码学更多的东西来运作。它需要向公众公开其可追踪、相互关联的交易的序列记录。这意味着（1）账本应该是公开的，以及（2）运行它的算法应该遵循开源原则，其源代码供所有人查看和测试。
- en: At the same time, however, the system must allow sufficient privacy capabilities
    and protections for individuals and their data, as people won’t use it if their
    personal identities and proprietary business secrets are open for the world to
    see. Bitcoin deals with this by displaying only the one-off alphanumeric “addresses”
    that are randomly assigned to users when they receive bitcoin and which tell you
    nothing about the identity of the people who control them. But it’s not an entirely
    anonymous system—it’s better described as “pseudonymous.” In Bitcoin it’s possible,
    by following transaction flows from one address to another, to trace the fund
    exchanges to an address where users can be identified—such as when they cash out
    into dollars at a regulated bitcoin exchange that keeps records of its customers’
    names, addresses, and other details. For certain cryptographers who take privacy
    very seriously, that’s not good enough. So a few are developing alternative cryptocurrencies—examples
    include Zcash, Monero, and Dash—that add even more privacy protection than Bitcoin.
    These other cryptocurrencies keep enough information on the ledger so that validating
    computers can be assured that the accounts have not been corrupted or manipulated,
    but do a more complete job of obscuring identities.

  zh: 与此同时，系统必须允许个人及其数据具有足够的隐私功能和保护，因为如果他们的个人身份和专有商业机密对外界是开放的，人们将不会使用它。比特币通过仅显示一次性的字母数字“地址”来处理这个问题，这些地址是在用户接收比特币时随机分配的，而且对于控制它们的人的身份没有任何信息。但这并不是一个完全匿名的系统——更好地描述为“伪匿名”。在比特币中，通过追踪从一个地址到另一个地址的交易流动，可以将资金交易追溯到一个可以识别用户的地址——比如当他们在记录客户姓名、地址和其他细节的受监管的比特币交易所中兑现成美元时。对于某些非常重视隐私的密码学家来说，这还不够好。因此，一些人正在开发替代加密货币——例如
    Zcash、Monero 和 Dash——这些替代加密货币比比特币提供了更多的隐私保护。这些其他加密货币在分类账上保留了足够的信息，以便验证计算机可以确保账户没有被篡改或操纵，但在模糊身份方面做得更全面。
- en: Whether the solution requires these extreme privacy measures or not, the broad
    model of a new ledger system that we laid out above—distributed, cryptographically
    secure, public yet private—may be just what’s needed to restore people’s confidence
    in society’s record-keeping systems. And to encourage people to re-engage in economic
    exchange and risk-taking.

- en: For society to function, we need a “consensus on facts,” says Tomicah Tillemen,
    a director at the New America Foundation in Washington and chairman of the Global
    Blockchain Business Council. “We need to establish a common reality that everyone
    can bind to. And the way we’ve done that in developed countries is we have institutions
    that are in charge of establishing those basic facts. Those institutions are under
    fire right now.… Blockchain has the potential to push back against that erosion
    and it has the potential to create a new dynamic in which everyone can come to
    agree on a core set of facts but also ensure the privacy of facts that should
    not be in the public domain.”

- en: 'Bitcoin showed how this idea works in one especially important context: money.
    By giving currency users a means of agreeing on the “facts” of their transactions,
    it allowed complete strangers to use an independent currency to pay each other
    securely over the Internet and still have a high level of confidence that counterfeiting
    was impossible, even in the absence of a centralized ledger-keeper like the Federal
    Reserve.'

  zh: 比特币在一个特别重要的领域展示了这一理念的运作方式：货币。通过给予货币用户在其交易“事实”上达成一致的手段，它使完全陌生的人可以在互联网上安全地互相支付，并且依然高度自信地相信即使没有像联邦储备系统这样的中央分类账记录员，也不可能有伪造行为。
- en: 'The more powerful revelation, however, was that a group of people could reach
    a consensus on facts without a central entity arbitrating the process. If we think
    about this as the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari would, in terms of how the
    power of human social organization comes from our ability to craft meaningful
    stories that we all believe in—notions of religion, nationality, common currency—we
    can see how important this is. The history of human civilization is not founded
    on absolute truths per se—after all, even scientific understandings are subject
    to revision—but on an even more powerful notion of the truth: a consensus, a common
    understanding on what we take to be the truth, a society-wide agreement that allows
    us to overcome suspicions, forge trust, and enter into cooperative endeavors.
    The best way to think about blockchain technology, then, is not as a replacement
    of trust—as a “trustless” solution, as some cryptocurrency fanatics damagingly
    describe it—but as a tool upon which society can create the common stories it
    needs to sow even greater trust, to build social capital, and to forge a better
    world.'

  zh: 但更有力的启示是，一群人可以在没有中央实体仲裁的情况下就事实达成共识。如果我们像以色列历史学家尤瓦尔·诺亚·哈拉瑞那样思考，从人类社会组织力量的角度来看，这来自于我们创造有意义的故事的能力，我们都相信这些故事——宗教、国籍、共同货币的概念——我们就能看到这是多么重要。人类文明的历史不是建立在绝对真理之上的——毕竟，即使科学理解也是可以修订的——而是建立在更强大的真理观念之上：共识，对我们认为的真理的共同理解，一个社会范围的协议，使我们能够克服怀疑，建立信任，并进入合作努力。因此，最好的思考区块链技术的方式不是将其视为对信任的替代品——正如一些加密货币狂热分子所描述的那样“无信任”的解决方案——而是将其视为一个工具，社会可以用它来创造所需的共同故事，以种植更大的信任，建立社会资本，打造一个更美好的世界。

    or misplaced—for blockchains as a solution to, well, just about anything. As people
    across a diverse range of fields start exploring its potential to disintermediate
    their industries and create new ways to unlock value, they are seeing in blockchain
    technology the potential for more than just a cash machine. If it can foster consensus
    in the way it has been shown to with Bitcoin, it’s best understood as a Truth
    Machine.
