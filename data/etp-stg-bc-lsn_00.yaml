- en: Books are written by reflecting and building on the wisdom and work of other
    scholars, and this book is no different. I have benefited enormously from reading
    and following the writings and opinions of a large number of blockchain researchers
    and entrepreneurs. Blockchain has been sometimes referred to as the bedrock on
    which Web 3.0 will be built, a new version of the internet that draws on decentralized
    peer-to-peer interaction. For many, cryptocurrency is the starting point for their
    voyage into the intricacies of blockchain. And although blockchain has been extensively
    deployed in gestating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, I highlight the extensive
    application potential of blockchain and the underlying distributed ledger technology
    for enterprises and across society.

  zh: 书籍是通过反思和借鉴其他学者的智慧和作品来撰写的，这本书也不例外。我极大地受益于阅读并遵循众多区块链研究者和企业家的工作和观点。区块链有时被称为构建Web
    3.0的基石，这是一个新的互联网版本，它依赖于去中心化的点对点互动。对许多人来说，加密货币是他们探索区块链复杂性的起点。尽管区块链已经在孕育比特币和其他加密货币方面得到了广泛应用，但我强调了区块链及其底层分布式账本技术在企业和整个社会中的广泛应用潜力。
- en: Blockchain is a fast-changing field at a stage where there are new developments
    every week, and as I researched and wrote this book, I was constantly rewriting
    to reflect this continually morphing space. Hence, writing this book—and reading
    it—is the beginning of a journey. I hope this book stimulates your interest and
    leaves you wanting to learn more.
