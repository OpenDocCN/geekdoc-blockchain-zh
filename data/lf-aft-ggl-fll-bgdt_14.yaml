- en: The Netscape IPO in 1995 also meant distribution of the rewards of the Internet.
    On the very first day, the shares almost tripled to a valuation of more than $3
    billion, benefitting the public while inspiring and funding entrepreneurs to challenge
    the computing establishment. In the following five years, a spate of IPOs, from
    companies such as Google, Amazon, and a thousand dot-coms, fueled a boom of distributed
    Internet applications. Under what I called the Law of the Microcosm, innovation
    moved decisively to the edges of the network.

  zh: 1995 年的网景 IPO 也意味着互联网奖励的分发。在第一天，股票价格几乎翻了两番，达到了超过 30 亿美元的估值，使公众受益，激励并资助了挑战计算机界的企业家。在接下来的五年中，谷歌、亚马逊等公司的一系列
    IPO 推动了分布式互联网应用的繁荣。根据我所谓的“微观法则”，创新决定性地转移到了网络的边缘。
- en: It was a high point for technological entrepreneurship. After the year 2000,
    however, the number of startups would stagnate and IPOs nearly disappear for all
    but the biggest tech companies. In the wake of the Enron debacle, regulations
    under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act exacted a toll of some two million dollars for reaching
    public markets and imposed a rigid accounting regime high on paperwork and low
    on trust. It was entirely inimical to startup culture and finance.

  zh: 这是技术创业的高峰。然而，在 2000 年之后，初创公司的数量将停滞不前，IPO 几乎只留给了最大的科技公司。在安然公司的倒闭事件之后，萨班斯-奥克斯法案下的规定对于达到公开市场收取了大约两百万美元的代价，并实施了一套高度繁琐、信任度低的严格会计制度。这对初创企业文化和金融完全不利。

    be a public company is the “fair disclosure” lawyerization of all company communications.
    If you have to pass it by the lawyers, you probably won’t say anything of interest.
    All but the largest corporations became realms of nearly zero-entropy communications—all
    retro-numbers and no inside detail to make them significant.

- en: By the time Ali arrived at Princeton in 2012, Netscape had foundered. Its browser
    gave way to Microsoft’s Explorer, rolled out free and bundled with Windows 95\.
    Initiating the now common practice of Internet leviathans’ buying innovation,
    Microsoft was able to quell the Netscape challenge by acquiring the Spyglass browser.
    The leading designers of Spyglass, as it happened, were Netscape’s Andreessen
    and Eric Bina, who had developed its basics as Mosaic while at the University
    of Illinois’s supercomputer center. Microsoft acquired an elegant modular browser
    and made Netscape’s inventors compete with themselves.

- en: The IPO dearth continued for more than a decade. For nine months in 2016, there
    were no US IPOs at all. Instead, venture capitalists kept hundreds of “unicorns”—private
    companies valued at more than a billion dollars—in their corrals. Led by Uber
    and Airbnb, nearly all of them had private market caps higher than Netscape’s
    in its IPO. Most were less interested in going public than merging with a mammoth
    like Google/Alphabet or Facebook. Unlike the appreciation of earlier Internet
    companies such as Microsoft and Netscape, the appreciation of unicorns would not
    chiefly benefit the public. The returns (and burn rates) flowed mostly to the
    venture capitalists who held them and the leviathans that bought some of the best
    of them.

  zh: IPO 寒冬持续了十多年。2016 年的九个月里，美国根本没有 IPO。相反，风险投资家们把数百家“独角兽”——估值超过十亿美元的私营公司——留在了他们的牲口圈里。由
    Uber 和 Airbnb 领导，几乎所有这些公司在私人市场的市值都高于 Netscape 的 IPO。大多数公司对上市不感兴趣，而是更愿意与 Google/Alphabet
    或 Facebook 这样的巨头合并。与早期互联网公司如 Microsoft 和 Netscape 的增值不同，独角兽的增值主要不会惠及公众。收益（和烧钱速度）大多流向持有它们的风险投资家和收购其中一些最好公司的巨头们。

    protect property rights, defend privacy, host safe and efficient transactions,

    gets locked into ‘data-silos,’ e.g., data that is understood and stored by Facebook,
    Yahoo!, Google and others respectively but cannot be migrated across services.
    This leads to a centralized data model; the data silos inevitably get hacked eventually,

    They worked well for their proprietors but destroyed the global coherence of the
    Net and caused increasing segmentation. Within the segments, Google, Apple, Facebook,
    Amazon, et al. collected more and more private data and protected them with firewalls
    and encryption. But as time passed, they discovered that centralization is not
    safe. Putting data in central repositories solved hackers’ hardest problem for
    them: It told them which data were important and where they were, putting the

    honeypots by reacting to outbreaks of viruses, grand data thefts, denial-of-service
    attacks, malware, malvertisments, phishing schemes, ransomware, and other mischief.
    Each Internet fiefdom responded by foisting on its customers a flurry of security
    busywork that did nothing to improve security and got worse every year by every
    measure. “Security” programs merely let butterfingered data holders tell the courts
