- en: As always, Bitcoin is leading the pack as the currency with the most potential.
    With a market cap at over $75 billion, you can buy one Bitcoin at a little more
    than $3,600 (as of September 2017). This makes it the most expensive of cryptocurrencies
    on the market today.

  zh: 一如既往，比特币作为最具潜力的货币处于领先地位。其市值超过750亿美元，截至2017年9月，一个比特币的价格略超过3600美元。这使得它成为当今市场上最昂贵的加密货币。
- en: If you're not ready to put that much down on a single Bitcoin, you can start
    by a Satoshi (the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin). It is the equivalent of 000,000,001
    of a full Bitcoin. That means that if you buy 1 Satoshi at $3,641 a single Satoshi
    can cost you only $0.00004019, which amounts to only a fraction of a cent in USD.

  zh: 如果你不愿意为一个比特币投入那么多资金，你可以从开始一个 Satoshi（比特币的最小分数）做起。它相当于一个完整比特币的000,000,001。这意味着，如果你以3641美元的价格买一个
    Satoshi，一个 Satoshi 的成本只需0.00004019美元，换算成美元仅为一美分的一小部分。

- en: Another great cryptocurrency to start investing in is Ethereum (sometimes referred
    to as Ether). It is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing
    platform featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It provides a decentralized
    Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can
    execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. Today’s market
    cap for Ethereum is nearly $31 million with a price of about $328 for a single
    coin.

- en: Monero is gaining popularity because of its perfect world of anonymity. Because
    they go to great lengths to keep the identity of the investor private, many people
    are flocking to it. Unlike with other cryptocurrencies that maintain anonymity,
    once you give your wallet address to anyone they can see all of the transactions
    you have made in the past. While they cannot see the identity of who you traded
    with without decoding the information, it is clear that your secrecy is only as
    strong as your code.

  zh: Monero因其完美的匿名性而越来越受欢迎。因为他们竭尽全力保护投资者的身份隐私，所以很多人都在涌向它。与其他保持匿名性的加密货币不同，一旦你把你的钱包地址给任何人，他们就可以看到你过去所有的交易。虽然他们不通过解码信息就能看到与你交易的对方的身份，但很显然，你的秘密只取决于你的代码有多强大。

    other investor's coins, so you have no idea of who owns what or how much.

    within which the currency is transferred. It is a distributed, open-source payments
    system that’s still in beta. The goal of the ripple system, according to its website,
    is to enable people to break free of the “walled gardens” of financial networks
    – i.e., credit cards, banks, PayPal and other institutions that restrict access
    with fees, charges for currency exchanges and processing delays.

- en: '4\. Decentralized: Finally, the fact that the investments are not held on a
    centralized server making it much more difficult for hackers to access to it and
    compromise the system. Its value, therefore, is based more on supply and demand
    rather than by some third-party management system.'

  zh: 4. 去中心化：最后，由于投资不存储在中心化服务器上，使得黑客更难访问并破坏系统。因此，其价值更多地基于供求关系，而不是某些第三方管理系统。

    people fall victim to the hype surrounding every cryptocurrency-bubble. There
    is always somebody captured by FOMO (fear of missing out), buying massively in
    at the peak of a bubble, just in hope to make quick money, while not understanding
    cryptocurrencies at all. That’s a bad reason. Don’t do this.
