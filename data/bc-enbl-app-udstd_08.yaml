    clinical sciences are currently suffering from a paralyzing reproducibility crisis.
    From clinical psychiology to cancer biology, recent metaresearch indicates a rise
    in researchers failing to replicate studies published by their peers. This problem
    is not just limited to benchwork that happens in a lab; it also plagues translational
    research where the transformation from bench to bedside happens. Treatments, tests,
    and technologies are converted from simple lab experiments to government-approved
    devices and assays that affect hundreds of lives. Therefore, replicability is
    crucial to converting scientific breakthroughs into pragmatic remedies.The primary
    role of blockchain technology in the emerging landscape of open-access science
    is increasing the amount of transparency into the processes. To that end, three
    use cases and applications are presented in this chapter: The first one involves
    deposition of data in clinical trials, the second one involves a reputation system
    that can be developed for researchers and institutes committed to open research,
    and the third one involves the application of supply-chain management for tracking
    counterfeit drugs. We begin by discussing the current paradigms of the research
    method and the importance of negative data, and our focus remains limited primarily
    to the clinical sciences. Then, we talk about traditional metrics and altmetrics
    systems presently implemented to measure the impact of published research. This
    allows us to transition into the use cases that supplement traditional metrics
    and expand them to make open science a fundamental feature. Finally, we end our
    discussion by looking at ongoing efforts in psychology research to incorporate
    prediction markets to verify research, and how prediction markets can be created
    using Augur.'

    scientific discourse and investigation. One of the major cornerstones in research
    is the ability to follow written protocols from a study, using the documented
    methods to carry out experiments and arrive at the same conclusions given by that
    study. In other words, a published study can be independently verified by other
    researchers, and replicated to give the same results. Recent metaresearch in clinical
    sciences demonstrates that more and more published works are not rigorous enough
    experimentally to be replicated with ease. Freedman et al. estimated that over
    50 percent of preclinical research cannot be translated from animal models to
    human clinical trials, thereby placing the approximate annual cost of irreproducibility
    at $28 billion in the United States alone. Consequently, as preclinical findings
    in animal models are rarely repeated in clinical trials, drug discovery has slowed
    down and costs have risen dramatically. The economic costs are very debilitating;
    close to $200 billion is wasted annually because the discovered targets cannot
    be reproduced. These problems are often inherent to the design of a particular
    study, or due to very genuine intricacies and complications that arise in experiments
    on differing cell lines. To understand why, we have to look for answers in metaresearch,
    which is a branch of investigation that statistically evaluates the claims, results,
    and experiments performed in a study.A multitude of factors in academia are creating
    a vicious culture of “bad science,” as Dr. Ben Goldacre referred to it: a vanishing
    funding environment, a culture of “publish or perish,” and an incredible amount
    of pressure to get tenured pushes young researchers to follow erroneous methods
    to get published. In some cases, the slipshod research methods and manipulations
    have led to fraud and eventual retractions with serious consequences to the researcher.NoteRetraction
    Watch ( [http://retractionwatch.com/](http://retractionwatch.com/) ) is a blog
    that recently came about to report on scientific misconduct happening at all levels,
    from editors working with journals to individual researchers at universities.
    The blog also tracks papers that have been retracted from journals due to fraudulent
    data or manipulation of experimental evidence. The interested reader can follow
    their web site, which posts about 500 to 600 retractions per year.Academic journals
    are also partially to blame for this mess, although there are signs of real change
    and improvement in the works. Over the past years, it has been easier to publish
    studies with positive findings in journals regarding potential drug targets or
    effectiveness of a particular drug. Negative findings from experiments, such as
    a drug target not working even though it was expected to work, have been incredibly
    difficult to publish, however. At face value, it seems to make sense: Why would
    someone want to know if an experiment failed? Negative data usually get ignored
    because of similar reasoning, and from a marketing standpoint, a journal claiming
    that something did not work as expected is not a highlight that would sell. Let’s
    take a closer look at positive and negative data in the context of how journals
    have shaped their use and publication.Positive data simply confirm an initial
    hypothesis, where a researcher predicted a finding and the data validate it. On
    the other hand, negative data come from the cases where the expected or desired
    effect was not observed. If an experiment showed that no difference exists between
    the null and alternative hypotheses, the data and results will likely end up buried
    in the pile of unpublished results of the lab group. Figure [8-1](#Fig1) provides
    a very simplified overview of an erroneous research method for dealing with positive
    and negative data resulting from the pressures in academia. Replication is sacrificed
    in pursuit of highly demanding and attractive drug targets, which ultimately do
    not translate well into clinical trials and lead to more economic waste.![A430562_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.jpg)Figure
    8-1.Overview of positive and negative data in the context of publishing a studyThe
    flowchart in Figure [8-1](#Fig1) is a simple demonstration of hypothesis testing
    that leads to publication of “flukes” that are nonreplicable in translational
    research or scaled clinical trials. Due to the nature of publishing in academic
    journals, positive data usually imply that you are done. Most researchers will
    stop here, and not bother to follow up with any appreciable fraction of all the
    data that were collected or generated while conducting the experiments. This could
    include potential negative data regarding an avenue of thought that did not work,
    or information that was omitted due to feedback from reviewers. Once a research
    paper has been accepted, the authors have no further incentive to release more
    data or put in more time to clean up and make other results available. This turns
    out to have some detrimental consequences, which we discuss later in the chapter.These
    trends have been observed by journals internationally and they are beginning to
    take some action. A plethora of new initiatives are raising the standards for
    the data that can be included in a publication and the design considerations that
    must be fulfilled to ensure replication. Let’s talk about three of those efforts
    here.'

  zh: 让我们从科学论文和研究背景下重新审视可重复性的含义开始我们的讨论。在研究中的一个主要基石是能够遵循研究中的书面协议，使用记录的方法来进行实验，并得出与该研究给出的相同结论。换句话说，可以通过其他研究人员独立验证已发表的研究，并复制以得到相同的结果。最近在临床科学领域的元研究表明，越来越多的已发表作品在实验上不够严谨，不能轻松复制。Freedman等人估计，超过50％的临床前研究无法从动物模型转化为人类临床试验，因此仅在美国每年因不可重复性而产生的费用约为280亿美元。因此，由于动物模型中的临床前发现很少在临床试验中重复，药物发现已经放缓，并且成本急剧上升。经济成本非常严重；每年因无法复制而浪费近2000亿美元。这些问题通常固有于特定研究的设计中，或者是由于在不同细胞系上进行实验时出现的非常真实的复杂性和复杂性。要理解其中原因，我们必须在元研究中寻找答案，这是一种统计评估研究中所提出的主张、结果和实验的分支。在学术界，许多因素正在创造一种“糟糕科学”的恶性文化，正如Ben
    Goldacre博士所说的那样：一个逐渐消失的资金环境，一个“发表或灭亡”的文化，以及获得终身教职的巨大压力推动年轻研究者遵循错误方法以获得发表机会。在某些情况下，草率的研究方法和操纵导致了欺诈，最终导致了对研究人员的严重后果。注意Retraction
    Watch（[http://retractionwatch.com/](http://retractionwatch.com/)）是一个最近出现的博客，报告了从期刊编辑到大学个人研究员发生的科学不端行为。该博客还跟踪了因数据欺诈或操纵实验证据而从期刊中撤回的论文。感兴趣的读者可以关注他们的网站，该网站每年发布大约500到600篇撤回通知。学术期刊也部分地应对了这一混乱局面，尽管有真正改变和改进的迹象。在过去的几年中，发表关于潜在药物靶点或特定药物有效性的正面发现的研究变得更加容易。然而，负面实验结果，例如期望的药物靶点不起作用的情况，却非常难以发表。乍一看，似乎是有道理的：为什么有人想知道实验失败了呢？由于类似的推理，负面数据通常被忽略，从营销的角度来看，期刊声称某些事物不如预期地发挥作用并不是一个可以出售的亮点。让我们更详细地了解正面和负面数据在期刊如何塑造它们的使用和发布的情况。正面数据仅仅是确认最初的假设，研究人员预测了一个发现，而数据证实了这一点。另一方面，负面数据来自于没有观察到预期或期望效果的情况。如果一个实验显示在零假设和备择假设之间没有差异，那么这些数据和结果很可能最终会被埋在实验室小组未发表结果的堆中。图[8-1](#Fig1)提供了一个非常简化的概述，说明了在学术压力下处理正面和负面数据的错误研究方法。在追求需求量很大且具有吸引力的药物靶点时，复制被牺牲了，这些药物靶点最终无法很好地转化为临床试验，并导致更多的经济浪费。![A430562_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_8_Fig1_HTML.jpg)图8-1.

    at expense of shortening the methods section that provides instructions for other
    researchers to follow to replicate an experiment. Recently, most journals have
    moved online and space is less of an issue, although supplemental materials are
    still lacking in quality even when they are made available. BioMed Central has
    released a checklist of minimum standards that must be met before a paper can
    be published. The purpose of this checklist is to provide a level of standardization

    and positive data, the core of reproducibility crisis, and the difficulties that
    arise as a result. Next, we begin talking about the more serious consequences
    of data manipulation in the case of drug trials. The data points from clinical
    trials decide the fate of medications that will affect thousands of lives. Obtaining
    all relevant data is crucial not only for accurately prescribing medication, but
    also to avoid pitfalls and avenues already tackled in the past.NoteDr. Ben Goldacre
    gave a TED Talk in which he told a story of the drug lorcainide, released in 1980s.
    It was meant to be an anti-arrhythmic drug that could prevent abnormal heart rhythms
    in people who have had heart attacks. A small clinical trial was conducted in
    fewer than 100 patients, and unfortunately ten of them died. The drug was regarded
    as a failure and commercial development stopped. The data from this failed clinical
    trial were never published. Over the next few years, other drug companies had
    similar ideas for anti-arrhythmic drugs that were brought to market. It is approximated
    that 100,000 people died because these new drugs also caused an increased instance
    of death. In 1993, the researchers who conducted the original 1980 study came
    forth and wrote an apology mentioning that they attributed the increased death
    rate to chance in the initial trials. Had the data from this failed trial been
    published, however, they could have provided early warnings and prevented future
    deaths. This is just one example of the very serious consequences of publication
    bias. We tackle a generalized version of this scenario in the next section.

    Goldacre博士在一次TED演讲中讲述了关于1980年代发布的药物洛卡因的故事。它本来是一种抗心律失常药物，可以预防曾经患过心脏病的人出现异常心律。进行了一项小规模临床试验，参与人数少于100人，不幸的是，其中有十人死亡。这种药物被认为是一种失败，并且商业开发停止了。从这次失败的临床试验中得到的数据从未发表。在接下来的几年里，其他制药公司提出了类似的抗心律失常药物的想法，并将其投放市场。据估计，有10万人死于这些新药物也导致死亡率增加。1993年，进行了最初的1980年研究的研究人员站出来并写了一封致歉信，提到他们认为最初试验中增加的死亡率是由于偶然事件。然而，如果这次失败试验的数据已经发表，他们本可以提供早期警告并防止未来的死亡。这只是出版偏见非常严重后果的一个例子。我们将在下一节中讨论这种情况的一般化版本。

    transaction:{ metadata: {...Static data goes here...}, rules: {...Rule definitions
    go here...}}There are two rules from the rule engine that we will be using in
    our solution: the expiration rule and the minter rule. The expiration rule is
    used to loan an asset and it dictates the life span of an asset. After expiration,
    the asset returns to the last output that had a valid expiration. The minter rule
    grants a recipient permission to issue more of the same asset. Therefore, the
    minter receiving colored coins can further issue more colored coins to others
    on the network. Both rules play an important role for introducing scarcity in
    this instance of blockchain economics. What role does scarcity play? To understand
    this, we need to look at two players in this scenario: a holder and a minter.
    A holder is another rule from colored coins that dictates which address can hold
    an asset, and we have already described a minter.Figure [8-2](#Fig2) depicts the
    interaction between a researcher registering a clinical trial, providing updates,
    and a minter acknowledging reception of the updates, followed by a request to
    continue the next phase of the trial. Let’s walk through Figure [8-2](#Fig2) step
    by step. The clinical trial begins with our researcher registering the trial,
    which initiates a genesis colored transaction from the minter to the holder (our
    researcher). This transaction comes with an expiration rule attached, and this
    in a sense is the deadline for one of the several phases related to a given clinical
    trial. The researcher must send a colored transaction back to the minter, with
    URLs to metadata containing updates or new data. When the minter receives this
    transaction, an evaluation is performed on whether the asset was expired, and
    the result is exported. We return to this result in the next section. After this
    return transaction, the minter issues more colored coins to the holder for the
    next phase, and the cycle repeats. Each phase of the trial results in more data
    URLs being appended to the metadata sent by the holder as a sign of continuous
    updates.TipThe rules engine of colored coin protocol is also a part of the metadata
    not stored directly on the blockchain, but instead it is stored in plain JSON
    format using torrents. Torrents provide a decentralized mechanism to share data,
    and make it possible for rules to interact with objects outside of the blockchain.
    We have abstracted the minter here as an oracle, but the actual implementation
    would involve a hybrid of an automated evaluator and smart contract.The entire
    process visualized in Figure [8-2](#Fig2) can be considered analogous to the SSL
    handshake that forms the foundation of sure server–client interaction and symmetric
    encryption in our browsers. Perhaps in the future, one can extrapolate; if this
    type of interaction becomes common, it could become a feature of the colored coin
    wallet. The evaluation component of the minter address can become either a specialized
    wallet or a new client, similar to new protocols being included in a browser.![A430562_1_En_8_Fig2_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_8_Fig2_HTML.jpg)Figure
    8-2.Interactions between a minter and a holderThis process can create artificial
    scarcity by imposing the expiration rule. The holder (researcher) has to return
    a colored transaction with the data URLs corresponding to the update. The minter
    performs an evaluation on the state of the holder and then acknowledges the receipt
    of updates. New coins are issued for the next cycle of updates and the whole cycle
    begins anew. The evaluator result is exported and will be used to build a reputation
    system that we discuss shortly.Now that we have discussed the colored coin interactions,
    let’s take a look at the entire clinical trials system in Figure [8-3](#Fig3).![A430562_1_En_8_Fig3_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_8_Fig3_HTML.jpg)Figure
    8-3.Summary of blockchain integration into clinical trials workflowThe process
    begins with the registration and a proposed summary of what the clinical trial
    will entail, the methods being used, and what data or results can be expected.
    The summary information along with the approved protocol are appended to the blockchain
    before the trial begins. This completes the registration process. Colored coins
    and the rules engine are used to manage updates from researchers. These updates
    are appended to the blockchain after going through a light privacy protection
    check. Once the clinical data are on a common back end, the most important benefit
    is perhaps the shift of focus from back-end clients that hold databases to simply
    developing front-end clients that can read the blockchain. The management of data
    will happen automatically within the blockchain; all we need is a mechanism to
    read the tags or breadcrumbs left over in the metadata to know what to pull from
    an external location for further processing. An example of this case is the postprocessing
    unit shown in Figure [8-3](#Fig3). This unit contains the appropriate public–private
    key pair and permissions to read the blockchain and access the external locations.
    The same script that appended data updates to the blockchain also contains a segment
    for postprocessing that tells the postprocessing unit how to integrate data from
    various third-party locations into one local collection. After that, postanalysis
    statistical methods are used to determine the quality of the data appended and
    an automated report can be generated that summarizes the progress of the trial
    at given intervals. The intervals at which data updates should be required from
    researchers, along with instructions on how to process those data once made available
    are coded in a script, made available to the postprocessing unit.'

  zh: '这是向彩色交易添加的元数据的通用语法：{ metadata: {...Static data goes here...}, rules: {...Rule
    definitions go here...}}我们将在解决方案中使用规则引擎的两个规则：过期规则和铸币规则。 过期规则用于借出资产，并规定了资产的寿命。
    过期后，资产将返回具有有效到期日的最后输出。 铸币规则授予接收者发行更多相同资产的权限。 因此，接收到彩色硬币的铸币者可以进一步向网络中的其他人发行更多的彩色硬币。
    这两个规则在引入稀缺性方面发挥着重要作用。 稀缺性扮演了什么角色？ 要理解这一点，我们需要看看这种情况中的两个参与者：持有者和铸币者。 持有者是彩色硬币的另一个规则，指定了哪个地址可以持有资产，我们已经描述了铸币者。图[8-2](#Fig2)描绘了研究员注册临床试验、提供更新，并由铸币者确认接收更新，随后请求继续下一阶段试验的互动。
    让我们逐步走过图[8-2](#Fig2)。 临床试验始于我们的研究员注册试验，这启动了从铸币者到持有者（我们的研究员）的起源彩色交易。 该交易附带了一个过期规则，这在某种意义上是与给定临床试验相关的几个阶段中的一个的截止日期。
    研究员必须将带有更新或新数据的元数据的URL发送回铸币者。 当铸币者收到此交易时，将对资产是否已过期进行评估，并导出结果。 我们将在下一节讨论此返回交易的结果。
    在此返回交易之后，铸币者为下一阶段向持有者发行更多的彩色硬币，循环重复。 试验的每个阶段都会导致持有者发送的元数据中追加更多的数据URL，以示持续更新的迹象。提示彩色硬币协议的规则引擎也是元数据的一部分，不直接存储在区块链上，而是使用种子以纯文本JSON格式存储。
    种子提供了一种分散机制来共享数据，并使规则能够与区块链之外的对象交互。 我们在这里将铸币者抽象为一个oracle，但实际的实现将涉及自动评估器和智能合约的混合。
    图[8-2](#Fig2)中可视化的整个过程可以被认为是构成我们浏览器中对称加密的SSL握手的基础的确保服务器-客户端交互的特征。 或许在未来，人们可以推断；
    如果这种类型的交互变得普遍，它可能会成为彩色硬币钱包的一个功能。 铸币者地址的评估组件可以成为一个专门的钱包或一个新的客户端，类似于新协议被包含在浏览器中。
    这个过程通过强制执行过期规则可以创建人为稀缺性。 持有者（研究员）必须返回带有与更新相对应的数据URL的彩色交易。 铸币者对持有者的状态进行评估，然后确认接收更新。
    为下一轮更新发行新硬币，整个周期重新开始。 评估器的结果被导出，并将用于构建我们稍后讨论的声誉系统。现在我们已经讨论了彩色硬币的交互，让我们来看看图[8-3](#Fig3)中的整个临床试验系统。过程始于注册以及对临床试验将涉及的内容、所使用的方法以及可以预期的数据或结果的提议摘要。
    摘要信息连同批准的协议在试验开始前追加到区块链上。 这完成了注册过程。 使用彩色硬币和规则引擎来管理研究人员的更新。 在经过轻量级隐私保护检查后，这些更新被追加到区块链上。
    一旦临床数据在一个共同的后端上，最重要的好处也许是将重点从持有数据库的后端客户端简单地转移到只需开发能够读取区块链的前端客户端。 数据的管理将在区块链内自动进行；
    我们所需要的只是一种机制来读取元数据中留下的标签或面包屑，以知道从外部位置拉取什么进行进一步处理。 这种情况的一个示例是图[8-3](#Fig3)中显示的后处理单元。
    该单元包含适当的公钥-私钥对和权限，以读取区块链并访问外部位置。 与追加数据更新到区块链的脚本相同，后处理脚本还包含了一个用于后处理的段，告诉后处理单元如何将来自各个第三方位置的数据集'

- en: 'Let’s revisit the notion of scarcity. It was crucial for us to build the clinical
    trials system , however, the introduction of colored coins with the expiration
    rule also allows us to build another component, the reputation system. The premise
    of the reputation is simply tracking adherence to the expiration rule. Recall
    that we built an export feature in the evaluator function and here we can use
    the export as a counting mechanism to reward researchers (or holder addresses
    in the colored coin protocol) who have been proactive in sending periodic updates.
    In a practical application, this export counter would become added to the metadata
    by the minter after periodic updates have been established. From here, establishing
    reputation is a straightforward task: A higher export counter corresponds to a
    better reputation.It is important to note that for our clinical trials system,
    reputation simply emerged as a property of the design, but it has some far-reaching
    implications concerning reproducibility. High reputation indicates the commitment
    of an institution or a research group toward quality control. Once a reputation
    mechanism is implemented network-wide on a blockchain, it can be referenced externally:
    Third-party services can request the reputation score associated with a particular
    colored wallet. This can be as simple as an API call to return the rep_score of
    a wallet. Why would this be useful? Earlier in our discussion, we mentioned the
    DDI, and here we want to expand the notion of DDI from just being a data repository
    to a repository with rep_score tags. This can provide another layer of granularity
    into DDI: a tag of reputation scores (high or low) on data sets linked to clinical
    trials that are available to the public. Keep in mind that within this design,
    all the data from clinical trials or updates reside in the DDI repositories; however,
    the rep_score lives in the blockchain metadata through colored transactions. Figure
    [8-4](#Fig4) describes the sequential evaluation happening with each periodic
    update and the incremental addition of reputation in rep_score.![A430562_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.jpg)Figure
    8-4.Overview of rep_score increasing with each periodic updateThe evaluator function
    checks for an expiration rule and if the colored transactions made by the holder
    contain the URLs corresponding to updates in the metadata. If those two conditions
    are met, the rep_score is updated for the holder’s wallet. This slow increase
    allows for the reputation to build over time, and the rep_score parameter can
    be referenced in a blockchain agnostic manner from external services. API calls
    can become the default manner of attaching an up-to-date rep_score to databases
    deposited at DDI.Now that we have a better understanding of the rep_score mechanism,
    let’s look at the complete reputation system. Figure [8-5](#Fig5) provides a comprehensive
    depiction of a reputation system and its consequences for the members network-wide.![A430562_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.jpg)Figure
    8-5.The reputation systemIt begins with the blockchain recording colored transactions
    happening between the minter and holder roles from colored coin protocol . These
    colored transactions happen each time the holder provides an update, and the minter
    evaluates it. After the initial update, the minter sends a rep_score as a part
    of the returned colored transaction to carry on the update process for a clinical
    trial. The reputation now gets amended to the metadata with each exchange and
    the rep_score gets revised each time. This score can eventually become an attribute
    of the holder’s wallet, and in this manner, it can be referenced externally from
    the blockchain. The postprocessing unit becomes important after the clinical trial
    has matured to generate enough updates that can be compiled in one comprehensive
    overview. The purpose of this unit would be to automatically perform quality control
    statistical calculations and share the updates following instructions in a script
    added to the blockchain in the beginning of the trial. In a similar fashion, the
    postprocessing unit will compile a final summary and attach that to the institution’s
    page, along with all the updates shared from the clinical trial.NoteIt must be
    noted that postprocessing and data storage are all functions done off the blockchain.
    No calculations or data manipulations are performed on the blockchain. We want
    to limit the blockchain-executable code as much as possible to only the necessary
    primitives. The only tools that interact with transactions or metadata on the
    blockchain are in place to update the distributed state of a variable or parameter.'

  zh: 让我们重新审视稀缺性的概念。对于我们来说，建立临床试验系统至关重要，然而，引入带有到期规则的有色硬币也使我们能够构建另一个组件，声誉系统。声誉的前提只是跟踪遵守到期规则。回想一下，我们在评估器功能中构建了一个导出功能，而在这里，我们可以将导出用作一种计数机制，以奖励那些在发送定期更新方面积极主动的研究人员（或有色硬币协议中的持有者地址）。在实际应用中，这个导出计数器将在建立了定期更新后由铸造者添加到元数据中。从这里开始，建立声誉是一项直截了当的任务：较高的导出计数器对应于更好的声誉。重要的是要注意，对于我们的临床试验系统，声誉只是作为设计的一个属性而出现，但它对于可再现性有着一些深远的影响。高声誉表明一个机构或一个研究团队对质量控制的承诺。一旦声誉机制在区块链上网络范围内实施，就可以在外部引用它：第三方服务可以请求与特定有色钱包关联的声誉分数。这可以简单地是一个API调用，以返回钱包的rep_score。这有什么用处呢？在我们的讨论中，我们早些时候提到了DDI，这里我们希望将DDI的概念从仅仅是一个数据存储库扩展到一个带有rep_score标签的存储库。这可以为DDI提供另一层次的细化：与公开可用的临床试验相关的数据集上的声誉分数标签（高或低）。请记住，在这个设计中，所有来自临床试验或更新的数据都驻留在DDI存储库中；然而，rep_score存放在区块链元数据中，通过有色交易。图[8-4](#Fig4)描述了每个定期更新中正在进行的顺序评估以及rep_score的逐渐增加。![A430562_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_8_Fig4_HTML.jpg)图8-4.rep_score随着每个定期更新的综合评估功能检查到期规则，并且如果持有人进行的有色交易包含与元数据中的更新相对应的URL，则满足这两个条件，则更新持有人的钱包的rep_score。这种缓慢增加允许声誉随着时间的推移而建立，并且rep_score参数可以从外部服务中以与区块链无关的方式引用。API调用可以成为将最新的rep_score附加到DDI中存放的数据库的默认方式。现在我们对rep_score机制有了更好的了解，让我们看看完整的声誉系统。图[8-5](#Fig5)提供了声誉系统及其对整个成员网络的影响的全面描述。![A430562_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.jpg](Images/A430562_1_En_8_Fig5_HTML.jpg)图8-5.声誉系统它始于区块链记录有色硬币协议中发生的铸造者和持有者角色之间的有色交易。这些有色交易每次持有者提供更新时都会发生，铸造者对其进行评估。在初始更新之后，铸造者将rep_score作为返回的有色交易的一部分发送，以继续临床试验的更新过程。声誉现在随着每次交换而修订到元数据中，而rep_score每次都会修订。这个分数最终可以成为持有者钱包的一个属性，并且通过这种方式，它可以从区块链外部被引用。在临床试验成熟到足以产生足够的更新并可以编制成一份全面概述之后，后处理单元变得重要起来。这个单元的目的是自动执行质量控制统计计算，并根据在试验开始时添加到区块链的脚本中的指令共享更新。类似地，后处理单元将编制最终摘要，并将其附加到机构的页面上，以及从临床试验中共享的所有更新。注意必须指出，后处理和数据存储都是在区块链之外执行的功能。没有计算或数据操作在区块链上执行。我们希望尽可能地将区块链可执行代码限制在必要的原语上。唯一与区块链上的交易或元数据交互的工具是为了更新变量或参数的分布状态。

    researchers accountable for providing additional scientific data that can enhance
    the reproducibility of published studies. A crucial challenge to achieving this
    goal is the alignment of incentives for researchers to gain benefits from making
    their data available. Let’s look at some current efforts in academia that would
    make integration of a blockchain in existing infrastructure more feasible.In 2015,
    a large-scale crowd-funded replication effort was underway to verify key findings
    from 100 psychology studies. Before this effort concluded, some of the researchers
    filled out a survey for 44 studies indicating the likelihood they thought that
    the study’s main finding would be successfully replicated. The same researchers
    also played a betting game: They were given $100 USD to buy and trade contracts
    in the ongoing replication efforts. Each contract would pay $1 if the key finding
    were to be successfully replicated. Data from the survey and the betting games
    was collected and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
    (PNAS). It turns out that the survey predictions were about as accurate as a coin
    flip. However, if the researchers engaged in a betting market on the same question,
    the data gave a good prediction (with approximately 71% accuracy) of which studies
    would hold up if replicated. The market approach might have been more accurate
    than the survey for two reasons: First, there were monetary incentives to make
    the best bet, and second because the market enables people to learn trends from
    other players and to adjust their bets. The authors of the PNAS study suggest
    that prediction markets can be used to decide which studies should be prioritized
    in replication efforts due to their uncertainty. They warn that prediction markets
    will not reliably predict which individual findings are accurate, but they can
    be used to estimate the credibility of current findings and make an ordered queue
    of studies to be replicated.Setting up a prediction market would require a platform,
    and that’s where Augar comes in. Augar is a decentralized prediction market platform
    that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. The underlying exchange of value on Augar
    is REP tokens or reputation. REP is used by referees (also known as reporters)
    to report event outcomes on the platform, and Ether is used by other users to
    place bets on markets.On Augar, the prediction market works in two phases: Forecast
    and reporting. Initially, a user supplies some funds to creates a prediction market
    to address an event outcome or question, and the forecasting period begins. Other
    users place their bets during this period and the event matures. After the event
    has happened, the reporting period begins. The reporters act as oracles for the
    network and submit their answers or outcome. After a sufficient number of answers
    have been received, a consensus on the event is generated. The reporters who submitted
    the correct outcome are rewarded with reputation for their service, and the users
    who made a bet on the correct outcome are paid out in Ether.The betting games
    played by researchers in the PNAS study can be repeated on a platform like Augar
    at a larger scale. More work remains to be done before Augar can be used for prediction
    in replication studies, but the platform has all the required features to serve
    large-scale reproducibility efforts.'
