    is something that would be appear to be something of a contradiction. Making effective
    decisions, be it choices linked to investment strategy or audit efficiency, require
    that the decision makers involved be able to drill down and ascertain exactly
    which pieces of data are the most important. The simple reality, however, is that
    as business continues to become more fluid, digitized, and global in nature ambiguity
    will continue to increase. Especially since it does not look like some of the
    hard trends – such as changing demographics, political instability, and a rebalancing
    of how business is conducted on a global basis, will be changing anytime soon,
    it seems reasonable to expect that the profession will have to evolve in order

    associated with a stablecoin versus untethered or unpegged cryptocurrencies, an
    underlying reality quickly becomes apparent. In order for a stablecoin to function
    and work as advertised, there has to be confidence that the coin itself it actually
    pegged or tethered appropriately. In the case of a coin or token that is pegged
    or tethered to the USD, as USDT is, a core part of the pitch is that the organization
    actually has the underlying dollars to stabilize the currency. Different types
    of stablecoins may be stabilized differently, but in the case of a coin pegged
    to the USD this means that the organization must possess adequate dollar reserves
    to stabilize the coin during periods of market volatility.

    USDT，宣传的核心部分是组织实际上拥有基础美元来稳定货币。不同类型的稳定币可能有不同的稳定方式，但对于与美元挂钩的币，这意味着组织必须持有足够的美元储备来在市场波动期间稳定币的价值。

    this points to the importance of updating, adapting, and evolving current lines
    and work opportunities to meet the needs of a changing marketplace. An audit involves,
    as mentioned above, a robust examination and testing of both financial statements,
    as well as the internal controls in place at an organization. In the case of an
    organization such as Tether issuing a stablecoin, the importance of a functioning
    robust system of internal controls is difficult to overstate. In addition to the

- en: Perhaps one of the most interesting changes and shifts in the broader business
    environment overall is the change in the types and amounts of information that
    are increasingly expected of financial professionals in an environment that continues
    to evolve and change (Shoaf et al. [2018](#CR9)). While integrated reporting has
    become a headline factor and a topic in the economic conversation at large, the
    adoption and implementation of this idea by accounting and finance firms has been
    slower than might have otherwise been expected. This can be attributed to a number
    of factors, but perhaps one of the most logical reasons as to his lack of adoption
    has to do with the technology currently in use by most practitioners. Although
    the need for more detailed and comprehensive data on how an organization is performing
    is relatively well known at this point, technology tools and platforms have –
    for the most part – yet to catch up to market needs and expectations. Artificial
    intelligence, the rise of the internet of things, and blockchain technology are
    changing this reality on the ground, and increasingly enabling organizations and
    financial professionals the ability to deliver and analyze broader and more comprehensive
    types of data and information. Prior to taking advantage of technology to offer
    and deliver on the potential of these more comprehensive reporting platforms and
    other services, however, it is important to both revisit the concept of integrated
    reporting, and comment on the concept of a benefit corporation.

  zh: 或许在整个更广泛的商业环境中，最有趣的变化和转变之一是在一个不断发展和变化的环境中，对金融专业人员所期望的信息类型和数量的改变（Shoaf等人 [2018](#CR9)）。虽然整合报告已成为一个头条因素和经济谈话的一个话题，但会计和金融公司对这一理念的采用和实施比预期的要慢。这可以归因于许多因素，但或许最合乎逻辑的原因之一是大多数从业者目前使用的技术。尽管目前对组织绩效的更详细、更全面的数据需求相对来说已经为人所知，但技术工具和平台大多尚未满足市场的需求和期望。人工智能、物联网的崛起和区块链技术正在改变这一实际情况，并越来越能够使组织和金融专业人员能够提供和分析更广泛、更全面的数据和信息。然而，在利用技术来提供和交付这些更全面的报告平台和其他服务的潜力之前，重审整合报告的概念，并评论受益公司的概念是很重要的。
- en: At the core of the idea, the concept of a benefit corporation appears to represent
    almost an ideal merger and representation of how sustainability is being incorporated
    in financial services practices and protocols in the current marketplace (Zhou
    et al. [2017](#CR10)). The specific benefit corporation rules and processes will
    vary from state to state, but the core of the idea can be summarized as follows.
    A benefit corporation, via inclusion within the corporate charter, operating agreement,
    or other form of corporate bylaws and policies, includes the prioritization of
    sustainability as well as other social and governance related activities with
    equal weighting as the financial goals of the organization. These goals and policies
    will vary from firm to firm but can be focused on the environmental impact of
    organizational operations on the broader community, social policies aimed at range
    of societal goals in alignment with organizational beliefs, and the different
    aspects and ranges of governance that are often raised as both potential opportunities
    and challenges to organizations in the marketplace. Implications that can result
    from the desire to implement such a managerial model can include, but are not
    limited to following.

  zh: 这一思想的核心概念是，受益公司似乎代表了可持续性如何被纳入当前市场金融服务实践和协议的一个几乎理想的合并和代表（Zhou等人 [2017](#CR10)）。具体的受益公司规则和流程将因州而异，但这一思想的核心可以总结如下。通过在公司章程、经营协议或其他形式的公司章程和政策中包含，受益公司将可持续性的优先级以及其他社会和治理相关活动与组织的财务目标同等对待。这些目标和政策会因公司而异，但可以侧重于组织运营对广泛社区的环境影响、与组织信念一致的社会政策以及通常被提出作为组织在市场上潜在机会和挑战的不同治理方面和范围。实施这种管理模式的愿望可能导致以下，但不限于以下结果。
- en: First, if an organization wishes to grant equal importance to traditionally
    qualitative issues like governance, environmental matter, or different socially
    oriented agenda items, the firm must be able to accurately measure, rank, and
    track these different types of information. Specifically, and linking back to
    the core topic of this book, the organization must have both the technology tools
    themselves as well the personnel to leverage these tools effectively. For example,
    linking an automation, robotic process automation initiative, or a full blown
    artificial intelligence project to the increasing streams of data already produced
    by the organization in any case represents a method by which current data can
    actually be made more useful for business decision making purposes. While that
    in and of itself may seem rather obvious, the technology tools to enable such
    an undertaking have only recently become available in the marketplace. Financial
    professionals should, especially as traditional compliance, reporting, and analysis
    tasks become augment or fully automated, be looking for opportunities to expand
    service offerings into new lines and areas of business (Bouten and Hoozée [2015](#CR2)).
    The rise of interest in more comprehensive reporting models such as benefit corporations,
    as well as the need for practitioners to meet the needs of the marketplace, will
    invariably converge in the arena of assisting organizations in the creation and
    issuance of said reporting models and structures.

  zh: 首先，如果一个组织希望给予传统上定性问题如治理、环境事务或不同的社会导向议题平等的重要性，那么公司必须能够准确衡量、排名和追踪这些不同类型的信息。具体来说，回到本书的核心话题，组织必须既有技术工具本身，又有能够有效利用这些工具的人员。例如，将自动化、机器人流程自动化倡议或全面的人工智能项目与组织已产生的日益增多的数据流联系起来，实际上代表了当前数据可以为业务决策做出更有用的方式。虽然这本身似乎显而易见，但使这样的事业成为可能的技术工具直到最近才在市场上变得可用。金融专业人士应当特别寻找机会，将传统的合规、报告和分析任务辅助或完全自动化之际，拓展服务领域到新的业务线和领域（Bouten和Hoozée[2015](#CR2)）。对更全面的报告模型如利益公司的兴趣上升，以及从业者满足市场需求的需要，必将不可避免地融入协助组织创建和发行上述报告模型和结构的领域中。
- en: Second the full integration of sustainability goals and policies into the corporate
    decision making process will lead to a market generated need and expectation that
    corporations and the management professionals running these firms have the ability
    to not only produce and analyze larger and more varied amounts of information,
    but also make effective business decisions as a result of this information. The
    ability of the organization to make effective decisions with a larger base and
    pool of available information is, for lack of a more appropriate term, a requirement
    of organizations seeking to fully accrue the benefits of establishing a benefit
    corporation mindset or even simply implementing a more robust reporting and analysis
    framework. Financial professionals have an opportunity here as well. In essence,
    the core duty and responsibility of financial services professionals to most organizations
    has revolved around the ability of these practitioners to analyze organizational
    information, and to also effectively summarize said information to both the management
    team of the firm and external end users. Such an expectation and market need has
    been reduced simply because sustainability issues have become more mainstream.
    Rather, as the variety and quantity of data at the disposal of organizations has
    continued to increase, the need for high quality decision making has only increased.

    does not appear to be changing with the growing implementation of new business
    entity types. Although the conversation surrounding benefit corporations may seem
    like an odd inclusion into a text focusing on emerging technologies, upon further
    review it is not as contradictory as it might initially appear Hemphill and Cullari
    [2014](#CR4)). For example, in order to obtain either the b-corp certification
    (from B Lab) or change the choice of entity to that of a benefit corporation,
    the organization must produce additional information on top of the regular financial
    statements already reported to the marketplace. Prior to drilling into those specific
    reporting requirements, however, it seems appropriate to differentiate between
    benefit corporations and the B-corp certification.

    [2014](#CR4))。例如，为了获得b-corp认证（来自B Lab）或将实体选择更改为受益公司，组织必须在已向市场报告的常规财务报表上额外提供信息。然而，在深入研究这些具体的报告要求之前，似乎有必要区分受益公司和B-corp认证。
- en: Benefit corporations represent an additional choice of entity that is available
    to management professionals when organization and managing a business. Although
    it is an additional choice of entity at the state level, it is important to note
    that the selection of this business structure and entity classification does not
    generate accretive tax benefits for the organization itself (Benson et al. [2018](#CR1)).
    Rather, it is choice of entity, governed by state legislation and reporting requirements,
    that an organization may voluntarily choice to embrace. As a requirement of this
    choice of entity, the organization must also agree to the publication and distribution
    of a benefit report, deliverable at least to the state legislature and possibly
    additional stakeholders depending on the market itself. This, in addition to imposing
    regulatory and accountability onto the organization to indeed operate in a manner
    consistent with the benefit corporation corporate charter, also points to the
    need for improved technology solutions. Put simply, in order to generate, collect,
    and report the vast array of data and information required to assemble and communicate
    a benefit corporation report, the entity must have access to these different classes
    of information on a continuous basis. This opens the door to both different technology
    solutions including the leveraging of RPA and other automation tools to gather
    and analyze this information as well as attracting investment opportunities overall.

- en: In addition to the technology tools and opportunities embedded in the leveraging
    of technology, this can also lead to the creation of new business opportunities
    as a result of this technological integration. There is increasing interest and
    focus among the investing public to invest in organizations and companies that
    operate in a sustainable manner. For organizations and management professionals
    seeking to generate additional and accretive value, appealing to this ever increasing
    market segment is a logical approach. Specifically, financial services professionals
    will be able, by leveraging and explaining the implications of different technology
    tools, appeal and address the expectations of management teams seeking more forward
    looking and business oriented advice from financial professionals. Simply because
    technology is playing an increasingly important role the management decision making
    process does not mean that all iterations have to be directly linked to technology
    functionality. Using technology and the disruption generated by increased technology
    integration represents a quantitative method by which financial professionals
    can seize upon this interest to add value in potentially unexpected areas. With
    all of that said, however, this book does indeed focus on technology itself, and

- en: A common tool or tactic being put into practice at a variety of organizations,
    but especially those seeking to generate and create more comprehensive reporting
    structures, is to harness and leverage the increased interconnectedness of the
    internet of things movement that has continued to play a more prominent role in
    how business decisions are made. For all of the benefits, of which there are many,
    that can be generated and created as a result of more interconnected operations
    and pieces of equipment, this also opens the door for potential hacks and breaches
    (Davis [2016](#CR3)). Hacks and breaches of financial information can be, of course,
    devastating and massively disruptive, but can almost always be addressed and covered
    by appropriate insurance either through private channels or government sponsored
    means. Operational data that is stolen, breached, or otherwise corrupted can potentially
    have even more disruptive and damaging consequences. For example, and especially
    for organizations operating either in the food safety or food delivery business,
    a breakdown, missing information, or attack on the backend systems in these areas

    paradigm shifting in nature that it may be, is not going to change business or
    improve performance in and of itself. Stated another way, the technology tools
    in and of themselves are not going to meet the needs of stakeholders and external
    users of financial data. For financial services professionals to actually add
    increased value, analyze broader business trends, and evolve into a strategic
    partner, technology tools will need to be adapted to the needs of clients both
    current and future. One of the largest and most well-funded, from a financial
    perspective, shifts and changes underway at client organizations is the importance
    of sustainability and sustainable investing. Taking full advantage of the increased
    efficiency, better data security, and enhanced reporting ability that can be generated
    via these tools allows practitioners to successfully meet this market need. Whether
    it is integrated reporting, sustainability reporting and other affiliated information,
    or being able to effectively analyze ESG related ETF’s and other financial investments,
