- en: To keep things simple, blockchain can often be considered as a database. There
    are some similarities since the blockchain is going to store onto transactions
    as well as other records of value. However, it is not enough to say that blockchain
    is just a new database type. Yes, when you are working with a blockchain ledger,
    it will store information, but saying that it is just a database is not going
    to be enough to explain some of the neat things that this technology can do or
    the reasons that Bitcoin and other industries are applying this technology.

  zh: 为了保持简单，区块链常常可以被看作是一个数据库。由于区块链也会存储交易以及其他价值记录，所以两者之间存在一些相似之处。然而，仅仅说区块链只是一个新型的数据库还不够。是的，当你在区块链账本上工作时，它会存储信息，但是说它只是一个数据库还不足以解释这项技术能做的
    neat（巧妙）事情，或者解释比特币和其他行业为何应用这项技术的原因。
- en: The best way to see how the blockchain works are to compare it with traditional
    databases. With these, when you put a new transaction on the ledger, you would
    have to work with a third party that you trusted, like a financial institution
    or a government, to help record the information and keep it all safe for you.
    It was the responsibility for these third parties to help build up trust between
    themselves and their customers. For example, a bank can build up this trust because
    it has the government behind it, ensuring the money so you will always be able
    to get your money back out no matter what kind of trouble the bank runs into.

  zh: 要了解区块链是如何工作的，最好的方法就是拿它与传统数据库进行比较。在这些数据库中，当你在账本上添加新的交易时，你得与一个值得你信任的第三方合作，比如金融机构或政府，来帮助记录信息并为你保管。这些第三方的责任就是帮助建立他们与客户之间的信任。例如，银行可以建立这种信任，因为背后有政府的支持，确保货币安全，这样无论银行遇到什么麻烦，你总能够取回你的钱。
- en: This trust is really important when we complete our transactions. Any time that
    we do a transfer of money, such as when we make payments for goods and services,
    we have to trust the bank or financial institution that we work with. They will
    take the exact right amount of our accounts and then give it to the right seller.
    The seller also has to trust this system as well, trusting that the money will
    end up in their account and not get lost or be the wrong amount.

    to do these transactions accurately for us, no matter what seller or store we
    are working with. We also trust that the company will maintain a database that
    will maintain all of the transactions and that the company will make sure that
    they keep all of your personal information safe from hackers and other individuals.

    of money there because the financial institution has shown they can be trustworthy.

    trust and the same security without needing to rely on those third parties in
    the process. This is why blockchain is used on Bitcoin and other digital currencies.
    These currencies are still growing and haven’t had the time to build up the trust
    that is needed, so blockchain helps to add in the trust. These currencies have
    no government backing, are brand new, and just haven’t had the history to see
    how well they would do. This means that blockchain has some work ahead of it,
    but it is possible to rely on this technology to complete your transactions.

    how blockchain will work on these networks. It will work similarly on other networks
    as well, but this will help to keep things in order. On the blockchain, when you
    complete a transaction, it will end up showing up, in order, on one of the blocks
    you are using. When the block is filled up, it will join in the permanent record
    and will link together with the other blocks that you have completed to form a

    it secure from others who may want to take a look at the information.

    statements, they will all become part of your bank history. They will be a part
    of your permanent record with the bank (or regarding the blockchain, with the
    Bitcoin network), and you can always look back to see what payments you made,
    what funds you received, and any other transaction. The main difference between

    of each hash needs to have a certain number of zeroes and since you don't know

    before getting results. Also, the hashes have to be designed so that if any one
    character in the chain is changed, it is going to change up all of the characters

    $3200 right now, this can be a good reward for the work that they are doing. This
