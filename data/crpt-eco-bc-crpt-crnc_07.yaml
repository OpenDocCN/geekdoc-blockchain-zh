  zh: BEYOND BOUNDARIES—CRYPTO ECONOMICS AROUND THE WORLD
- en: By design, blockchain transcends individual nations and states. Perhaps for
    this reason, it is often associated with the idea of globalization. We know from
    even the most cursory glance at history that every major technological innovation
    makes the world smaller. The most recent culprit was the Internet, which made
    the world smaller by bringing people together in exciting new ways. I believe
    that the application of blockchain to finance will bring humans even closer to
    one another. It will also, in my opinion, unleash revolutionary positive changes
    onto society.

    minded people. Today, it is also emerging as the place for crypto innovation in
    Europe. People in finance have long known that Switzerland is an effective place
    to grow new businesses, because it pairs a stable infrastructure with financial
    expertise and resources. Finance is the main industry in Switzerland, and the
    Swiss have one of the highest average incomes of any country in Europe. According
    to the WEF 2015 report, Switzerland ranks at the very top when it comes to global
    economic competitiveness. These factors combine to make Switzerland one of the

    generally aware of the extent to which Switzerland provides robust financial services
    to clients (and also respects their privacy), but it is fast gaining a reputation
    as a place where decentralized financial tools can grow. The probusiness environment,
    lack of regulation, and low tax rates in this country have attracted many entrepreneurs
    and high-end professionals. Perhaps it should be no surprise that Switzerland

    of blockchain in other areas, such as government. Voting in Zug was already possible

  zh: 然而，为了增加交易过程的透明度（以及帮助预防洗钱），韩国在2018年1月23日实行了“实名”加密货币交易政策。该政策禁止匿名、无法追踪的交易。用户不能使用虚拟账户，而是必须通过银行账户进行交易以验证其身份。到目前为止，已有六家银行提供虚拟货币账户。为了避免被边缘化，韩国四大加密货币交易所已经转向实名账户。（这些包括Bithumb、Upbit、Coinone和Korbit。）并非每个人都喜欢“实名制”规定，许多人认为这阻碍了韩国加密货币市场的增长。对许多投资者来说，这项要求使得将法定货币转入加密货币市场账户变得过于困难。
- en: Like China, South Korea also banned ICOs. In September of 2017, the Financial
    Services Commission (FSC) in South Korea announced that all initial coin offerings
    would be banned. The FSC claimed it was taking this step because the trading of
    virtual currencies needed to be more tightly controlled and monitored. It was
    not more specific.

  zh: 与中国一样，韩国也对ICO实施了禁令。2017年9月，韩国金融监督院（FSC）宣布所有初始代币发行都将被禁止。FSC表示，采取这一措施是因为虚拟货币的交易需要更严格的控制和监管。但它没有提供更多的细节。

- en: Heading back to Europe, I want to note that Malta has also become a very attractive
    country for crypto exchanges. Binance recently announced its intention to move
    to Malta, and Okex is about to open an office in Malta, too. On July 4th, 2018,
    Malta approved three regulatory bills designed to encourage crypto adoption. The
    bills are the Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act, the Innovative Technological
    Arrangement and Services Act, and the Virtual Financial Asset Act. These new laws
    are designed to provide clear regulation for companies using blockchain technologies
    in a way that will encourage innovation. It’s a move designed to lure crypto companies
    and blockchain startups to the island—and it’s working. Malta’s low tax rate probably
    doesn’t hurt, either.

  zh: 回到欧洲，我想指出，马耳他已经成为加密货币交易所的一个非常有吸引力的国家。币安最近宣布了其迁往马耳他的意图，而OKEx也即将在马耳他开设办公室。2018年7月4日，马耳他批准了三项旨在鼓励加密货币采用的监管法案。这些法案分别是《马耳他数字创新管理局法案》、《创新技术安排和服务法案》以及《虚拟金融资产法案》。这些新法律旨在为使用区块链技术的公司提供明确的监管，从而鼓励创新。这一举措旨在吸引加密货币公司和区块链初创公司到岛上发展——而且这一策略正在取得成功。马耳他低税率也许也起到了一定的作用。
- en: Singapore is a similar case to Malta. Since China and South Korea banned ICOs,
    Singapore has positioned itself as an Asian alternative for companies exploring
    ICOs. For many years, Singapore has been a major global financial center. But
    it is now also a very blockchain-friendly country. And in addition to ICOs, Singapore
    has emerged as a harbor for blockchain startups. The government is encouraging
    companies to come there to innovate in blockchain technology. Distinguishing it
    further from Malta, Singapore also has a very well-established financial infrastructure.
    This combination of friendly attitude, open-minded spirit, and physical infrastructure
    makes Singapore the place for Asian companies to do ICOs now.

  zh: 新加坡的情况与马耳他相似。自中国和韩国禁止ICO以来，新加坡将自己定位为探索ICO公司的亚洲替代选择。多年来，新加坡一直是全球主要的金融中心。但现在，它也是一个非常欢迎区块链技术的国家。除了ICO之外，新加坡已经成为区块链初创公司的避风港。政府鼓励公司到那里进行区块链技术的创新。与马耳他不同的是，新加坡还拥有非常发达的金融基础设施。这种友好的态度、开放的心态以及物理基础设施，使得新加坡成为亚洲公司进行ICO的理想之地。
- en: Tax havens have long been attracting attention from companies that raised capital
    through ICOs. Since the US and China do not allow ICOs, many companies that would
    like to do Initial Coin Offerings have accordingly set their sights offshore.
    Through the use of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), most British Virgin Island
    (BVI) ICOs are now structured through an ICO issuer incorporated as a BVI business
    company, which is possible under the BVI Business Companies Act of 2004 (the BCA).
    There is no specific regulation of any kind on ICOs in BVI. So, as you might imagine,
    it is poised to emerge as another hotspot.

  zh: 避税天堂长期以来一直吸引着通过ICO筹集资本的公司关注。由于美国和我国不允许ICO，许多希望进行首次币发行（ICO）的公司纷纷将目光投向海外。通过使用可变利益实体（VIEs），大多数英属维尔京群岛（BVI）的ICO现在都是通过作为BVI商业公司的ICO发行者来结构化的，这在2004年英属维尔京群岛商业公司法案（BCA）下是可行的。英属维尔京群岛没有对ICO进行任何具体类型的监管。因此，如您所想象，它正准备成为另一个热点。
- en: Cryptocurrency was born out of the ideology of decentralization. One of its
    goals is to encourage people to participate in transactions without third-party
    overseers. Despite these lofty ambitions, virtual currency has also had to learn
    to play along with the regulations local governments around the globe have seen
    fit to impose. The bear market of 2018 indicates the consequences of a lack of
    regulation. Large amounts of money are waiting for more regulation before they
    enter the crypto market. As it stands, traditional financial institutions have
    insufficient confidence in cryptocurrency and the crypto trading system. This
    limits the future possibilities for crypto economics. We want to enjoy freedom,
    but not create chaos. A balance must be struck. Exchanges that provide crypto
    trading platforms are rapidly globalizing. With more and more countries introducing
    clear, sensible regulation, I believe that crypto exchanges will survive and thrive,
    especially those that can bring themselves to play along with the government.

  zh: 加密货币起源于去中心化的理念。它的一个目标就是鼓励人们在没有第三方监督的情况下参与交易。尽管有这些宏伟的抱负，虚拟货币也必须学会遵守全球各地地方政府认为合适强加的监管规定。2018年的熊市表明了缺乏监管的后果。大量资金正在等待更多监管进入加密货币市场。目前，传统金融机构对加密货币和加密货币交易系统的信心不足。这限制了加密货币经济的未来可能性。我们想要享受自由，但不想制造混乱。必须保持平衡。提供加密货币交易平台的交易所正在迅速全球化。随着越来越多的国家引入明确、合理的监管，我相信加密货币交易所将幸存并蓬勃发展，尤其是那些能够与政府合作的交易所。
