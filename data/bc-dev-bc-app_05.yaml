- en: 'Chapter 5: Blockchain SecurityBlockchain is on two sides of the same coin,
    in that it has innovative practices that reinforce existing cybersecurity, but
    just like any other electronic entity, it needs securing of its own.The CIA triad
    is a security model designed to protect information. The three principles are
    Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. It aims to protect an organization’s
    data, devices and networks.The confidentiality principle ensures that all information
    goes undisclosed. This means that only approved users are granted access to view
    and change information.The integrity principle relies on the confidentiality principle
    being functional. As long as information is safe and untainted, integrity remains
    intact.The availability principle ensures that all devices work at full capacity
    so that the relevant parties have access to any and all information whenever they
    need it.Blockchain has taken the CIA triad, implemented and in some instances,
    improved it.In blockchain, we can look at the heavy encryption as adhering to
    the confidentiality aspect. Anything on a computer can be hacked, but the blockchain
    encryption is near impossible to break through. It would take a lot of time and
    energy to penetrate, so the information in the blocks is safe.The verification
    of transactions within the blockchain framework speaks to the integrity principle.
    We can be certain that the information stored has not been interfered with.Blockchain
    Security BasicsThe fact that all the data and functions in the blockchain network
    are not concentrated in one place makes it easier to verify transactions. There
    are multiple computers in a single distributed ledger. For the chain to be compromised,
    one person would have to assume control of at least 60% of those computers.The
    largest blockchain networks allow members of the public access. On the surface
    that may seem like a bad idea, but having so many computers on one network boosts
    security. The more people there are on the network, the easier it is to verify
    transactions. Also, the more computers there are on the network the harder it
    becomes to gain unsanctioned access to any blocks on the chain.Permissioned BlockchainsPermissioned
    Blockchains are private distributed ledgers that can only be accessed with pre-authorization.
    Not all users have far ranging control of all aspects in the blockchain though,
    there are ledger administrators who are in control of the access control layer
    of the ledger. They are also subject to verification checks but are the only people
    who are authorized to grant other users access. They are mainly used by companies
    that have a lot of sensitive information, like banks. Ripple is a permissioned
    blockchain that was developed by the banking industry to cut transaction costs.The
    key characteristics of a permissioned blockchain are:●     There is limited transparency●     There
    is no anonymity● There is also no central authority, but ledger administrators
    can allow or deny access.Advantages of a Permissioned Blockchain:● Provides fixed
    signatures that encrypt all transactions, making them more secure●     All users
    in the network are completely anonymous● Because there are no third parties, there
    isn’t a long waiting period between transactions● Information is not stored in
    a central archive so it''s easily accessible from any location at any timeDisadvantages
    of a Permissioned Blockchain:● The security of a permissioned network relies heavily
    on the integrity of its users● There is an element of censorship, because ledger
    administrators can restrict transactionsPermissionless BlockchainsPermissionless
    Blockchains are open to the public. Anybody with a computer can transact on these.
    All data is stored on several computers around the world and users are pretty
    much anonymous. Most cryptocurrencies use these networks.The key characteristics
    of a permissionless blockchain are:●     Complete transparency on all transactions●     Anonymity●     Operates
    without a central authorityAdvantages of a Permissionless Blockchain:● Less prone
    to cyber attacks. A hacker would have to gain control of at least 51% of the network
    to be able to do any damage● Uncensored. Because there are so many nodes participating
    in the network, there cannot be a central authorityDisadvantages of a Permissionless
    Blockchain:● Even though we’ve praised blockchain networks for being completely
    anonymous, there are some drawbacks. If by chance, somebody was to successfully
    commit fraud, it would be difficult to track them down. Also, people have been
    reported to use the blockchain network for unlawful activities.● Bitcoin relies
    heavily on the PoW system, and while it ensures security, it consumes a lot of
    energy and ends up being quite costly.●     The block size on a permissionless
    blockchain is limited.The Role of Miners in BlockchainMining has really taken
    off since Bitcoin arrived on the scene. Not only do they receive Bitcoin, but
    they add to the blockchain security protocol. Miners task themselves with validating
    all transactions and making sure they adhere to the Bitcoin code. On the Bitcoin
    blockchain, miners present their Proof of Work which signifies why they either
    approve or deny a particular transaction. They get paid in Bitcoin for every transaction
    they successfully validate.How Blockchain Security Averts Double SpendingBlockchain
    developers are cautiously optimistic about the steps they’ve taken to ensure visibility
    and security on different networks. But they are realistic about the fact that
    there is always a slim chance that some things can go unseen. Blockchains could
    fall victim to a double spending attack and a user could spend one unit of cryptocurrency
    a number of times before anything is picked up on the network.On the blockchains
    of the various cryptocurrencies, each network has to reach a consensus on the
    order of a transaction to be able to confirm and share them in full view of the
    entire network.The first ever cryptocurrency to solve the double spending problem
    was Bitcoin. Whenever a user would try and spend the same coin twice by sending
    it to two other users at the same time, both transactions would end up in a store
    for unconfirmed transactions. The first payment would be added to the coin’s chain
    as a block. The second transaction wouldn’t fit on the chain because it would
    be connected to the first and then the transaction would fail completely.Blockchain
    Security RisksBlockchain is a pretty solid technology but it has its vulnerabilities.
    Even though it’s difficult, there are a few ways Hackers could compromise the
    system. These are some of the ways:● Because the blockchain is decentralized there’s
    a ton of information traveling through cyberspace. A talented hacker could gain
    access to data while it’s on its way to the Internet Service Provider. Unfortunately
    there is no alert for this, so attacks like this can go unnoticed.● Wide-reaching
    public blockchains rely on a large number of computers for the purpose of mining.
    If a group of miners were to get together, they would have enough computing power
    to take over 50% of the network’s mining capacity. This is called a 51% attack.●
    Hackers can create an inordinate amount of false identities and crash a specific
    blockchain network. These are called Sybil attacks.● An age-old practice for hackers
    is phishing. Unfortunately blockchain isn’t immune. Hackers send well designed
    and constructed false emails requesting the login credentials of cryptocurrency
    wallet holders.● The lack of human involvement was originally what sold a lot
    of people on Blockchains, but now it’s receiving some mild criticism. People have
    cited the anonymity that the network allows as being the reason why it is used
    by unsavory characters like terrorist groups. It is said that they make use of
    blockchains and cryptocurrency to launder their money thus eluding banks and the
    long arm of the law.● As previously stated, blockchains need a ton of power to
    operate. According to Morgan Stanley, the bitcoin network consumes the same amount
    of energy as 2 million homes in the United States. The mining, which is a huge
    part of the model, is responsible for a lot of that consumption. The worst case
    scenario would be that the price of coins decreases and the price of electricity
    increases. This would see the number of miner’s decreasing heavily.Blockchain
    Security in PracticeWhile there is a standard for how a blockchain is supposed
    to operate, not all blockchains are exactly the same. Some companies have amended
    their security measures, either to save on costs or to cater to their specific
    security needs.Here are six examples:●     MobilecoinMobilecoin is a cryptocurrency
    company located in California. They are generating a safe and easy to use cryptocurrency
    for companies that can’t afford to implement ledger security procedures on their
    own. Mobilecoin replaces transaction service providers by keeping transaction
    information encrypted on both sides. Mobilecoin works with WhatsApp and Facebook
    Messenger.●     CoinbaseCoinbase, also based in California is a company that facilitates
    the acquiring and exchange of most, if not all cryptocurrencies. Every customer
    gets a digital wallet with a password. Coinbase relies solely on encryption and
    every employee is subject to exhaustive background checks to ensure the safety
    of their customers’ cryptocurrency.●     J.P. MorganJ.P. Morgan is a well-known
    financial institution in the United States. They have developed a version of Ethereum
    called Quorum. It caters to the specific needs of enterprises and uses blockchain
    technology to execute private transactions. They make use of Smart contracts on
    their network to ensure transparency and accuracy on all transactions.●     Lockheed
    MartinLockheed Martin is a defense contractor. A defense contractor is an entity
    that has an agreement with the United States to produce arms or take up arms for
    the national defense force. It is the first defense contractor to make use of
    blockchain security. They are collaborating with Guardtime federal to implement
    blockchain protocols in their software development, supply chain processes and
    engineering systems. They are using a blockchain network to keep track of their
    arms development systems.●     CiscoCisco is one of the largest tech companies,
    also located in California. They proposed the idea that blockchain complements
    the Internet of Things because there are no single points of failure and important
    information can be protected by encryption. If the Internet of Things adopts blockchain
    as it’s preferred network, it could see a spike in Blockchain’s profile.●     Hashed
    HealthHashed Health is a healthcare innovation firm located in Tennessee. They
    want to spearhead the movement to get the healthcare industry to make use of blockchain
    technology. Hashed Health has various subsidiaries and each one of them utilizes
    different facets of blockchain. They have already worked with a number of hospitals
    and facilitated the building of various blockchain networks that store and give
    access to patient information.'

  zh: 第5章：区块链安全区块链就像同一枚硬币的两面，它具有创新的做法来增强现有的网络安全性，但就像任何其他电子实体一样，它需要保护自身。CIA三角是一个旨在保护信息的安全模型。三个原则是保密性、完整性和可用性。它旨在保护组织的数据、设备和网络。保密性原则确保所有信息都不被泄露。这意味着只有经批准的用户才能访问和更改信息。完整性原则依赖于保密性原则的功能。只要信息是安全的和无污点的，完整性就保持完整。可用性原则确保所有设备都能够全面运行，使相关方在需要时都能访问任何和所有信息。区块链已经采用了CIA三角，并在某些情况下对其进行了改进。在区块链中，我们可以将重加密视为遵守保密性方面。计算机上的任何东西都可能被黑客攻破，但是区块链加密几乎不可能被破解。需要大量的时间和精力才能渗透，因此区块中的信息是安全的。区块链框架内的交易验证符合完整性原则。我们可以确信存储的信息没有被干扰。区块链安全基础事实上，区块链网络中的所有数据和功能都不集中在一个地方，从而更容易验证交易。单个分布式分类账中有多台计算机。为了破坏链，一个人必须控制至少60%的这些计算机。最大的区块链网络允许公众成员访问。表面上可能看起来是一个坏主意，但在一个网络上有这么多计算机可以提高安全性。网络上有更多的人，验证交易就更容易。此外，网络上有更多的计算机，就更难以未经批准地访问链上的任何区块。有权限的区块链有权对外公开分布账本进行访问。但并不是所有用户都能对区块链的所有方面进行广泛控制，有账本管理员控制着账本的访问控制层。他们也要经过验证检查，但是是唯一被授权授予其他用户访问权限的人。它们主要被一些拥有大量敏感信息的公司使用，比如银行。Ripple是一个由银行业开发的有权限的区块链，旨在降低交易成本。有权限的区块链的关键特征是：●
    透明度是有限的● 没有匿名性● 没有中央管理机构，但账本管理员可以允许或拒绝访问。有权限区块链的优点:● 提供固定签名，加密所有交易，使它们更安全● 网络中的所有用户都是完全匿名的●
    因为没有第三方，交易之间没有长时间的等待期间● 信息不存储在一个中央档案中，所以可以在任何时间、任何地点轻松访问。有权限区块链的缺点:● 有权限网络的安全性严重依赖于其用户的完整性●
    具有审查元素，因为账本管理员可以限制交易。无权限区块链无权限区块链对公众开放。任何人都可以在这些网络上进行交易。所有数据存储在世界各地的多台计算机上，用户几乎是匿名的。大多数加密货币使用这些网络。无权限区块链的关键特征是：●
    所有交易完全透明● 匿名性● 没有中央管理机构无权限区块链的优点:● 不太容易受到网络攻击。黑客必须控制至少51%的网络才能造成任何损害● 未经审查。因为网络上有如此多的节点参与，所以没有中央管理机构无权限区块链的缺点:●
    即使我们对区块链网络完全匿名表示赞赏，但也存在一些缺点。如果碰巧有人成功地进行欺诈活动，跟踪他们将是困难的。此外，有人报告说有人利用区块链网络进行非法活动。●
    比特币在很大程度上依赖PoW系统，虽然它确保了安全性，但它消耗了大量的能源，并且成本相当高。● 无权限区块链上的区块大小是有限的。矿工在区块链中的作用自比特币出现以来，挖矿真的火了起来。他们不仅收到比特币，而且增加了区块链安全协议。矿工要验证所有交易，并确保它们符合比特币代码。在比特币区块链上，矿工提供他们的工作证明，标明为什么他们要批准或否决特定交易。他们每次成功验证一笔交易都会收到比特币。区块链安全是如何避免双重支付的区块链开发人员对他们在不同网络上确保可见性和安全性所采取措施感到谨慎乐观。但他们也明白到总会有一些看似不易察觉的事情。区块链可能会遭受双重支付攻击，用户可能会在网络上多次花费某种加密货币单位，然后才会引起网络的关注。在各种加密货币的区块链上，每个网络都必须就交易的顺序达成共识，才能确认并在整个网络的完全视图中共享这些交易。第一个解决双重支付问题的加密货币是比特币。每当有人尝试通过同时将同一枚硬币发送给两个其他用户来重复使用同一枚硬币时，这两笔交易都会被添加到未经确认交易的存储中。第一笔支付将被添加到硬币区链上作为一个区块。第二笔交易将无法适应区块链，因为它将连接到第一笔交易，然后该交易将完全失败。区块链安全风险区块链是一种相当坚实的技术，但它也有其弱点。尽管很困难，黑客还是有几种方式可以破坏系统。以下是一些方法:●
    由于区块链是去中心化的，所以有大量的信息在网络空间中传播。一个有才能的黑客可以在数据传送到互联网服务提供商时获得访问。不幸的是，目前尚没有这方面的警报，因此这类攻击可能被忽略。●
    广泛使用的公共区块链依赖大量的计算机进行挖矿。如果一群矿工联合起来，他们将拥有足够的计算能力来占领网络50%的挖矿能力。这被称为51%攻击。● 黑客可以创建大量的虚假身份并破坏特定区块链网络。这被称为Sybil攻击。●
    对于黑客而言，钓鱼是一个古老的做法。不幸的是，区块链并不免疫。黑客发送设计良好的虚假电子邮件，要求加密货币钱包持有人的登陆凭证。● 最初区块链吸引人的原因是其缺乏人类参与，但现在它受到了一些轻微的批评。人们已经指出了网络允许匿名性的原因，这就是为什么它被恶劣的人物如恐怖组织所利用。据说他们利用区块链和加密货币来洗钱以逃避银行和法律的制裁。●
    如前所述，区块链需要大量的能量来运转。根据摩根士丹利的说法，比特币网络消耗了与美国200万个家庭相当的能源。挖矿，这是模式的一个巨大部分，对此贡献了很多。最糟糕的情况是，硬币的价格下跌，电费的价格上涨。这将导致矿工数量大幅下降。区块链安全实践尽管有一个区块链应该如何运行的标准，但并不是所有的区块链都完全相同。一些公司已经修改了他们的安全措施，要么是为了节约成本，要么是为了满足他们的特定安全需求。以下是六个例子:●
    MobilecoinMobilecoin是一家位于加利福尼亚的加密货币公司。他们正在为不能自行实施账本安全程序的公司创造一个安全且易于使用的加密货币。Mobilecoin通过在双方都加密交易信息来取代交易服务提供者。Mobilecoin与WhatsApp和Facebook
    Messenger合作。● CoinbaseCoinbase，也位于加利福尼亚，是一家促进大多数加密货币的收购和交换的公司。每个客户都有一个数字钱包和密码。Coinbase完全依靠加密，并且每个员工都要经历详尽的背景调查，以确保他们客户的加密货币的安全。●
    J.P. MorganJ.P.摩根是美国一家知名金融机构。他们开发了一款名为Quorum的以太坊的版本。它满足企业的特定需求，并使用区块链技术来执行私人交易。他们在网络上使用智能合约来确保所有交易的透明性和准确性。●
    洛克希德马丁Lockheed Martin是一家国防承包商。国防承包商是与美国政府达成协议生产武器或为国家防卫部队活动的实体。它是第一家利用区块链安全的国防承包商。他们正与守护时代联邦合作，以在他们的软件开发、供应链过程和工程系统中实施区块链协议。他们正在使用区块链网络来跟踪他们的军备发展系统。●
    CiscoCisco是加利福尼亚最大的科技公司之一。他们提出了区块链可以与物联网相辅相成的观念，因为没有单点失败且重要信息可以通过加密得到保护。如果物联网采用区块链作为其首选网络，那么区块链的名声可能会大增。●
    Hashed HealthHashed Health是美国田纳西州的一家医疗创新公司。他们希望带头推动医疗行业采用区块链技术。Hashed Health有各种子公司，每个子公司都利用区块链的不同方面。他们已经与许多医院合作，并推动建立了存储和提供病人信息的各种区块链网络。
