- en: About 2 years ago, I told my husband that instead of pursuing the usual path
    for a thirty-something general counsel at a start-up—toward the next bigger and
    better company—I would dive headfirst into the blockchain business world. He was
    … surprised. And I am certain that, as he politely smiled and asked “why?” he
    was wondering if I had hit my midlife crisis earlier than expected.

    Well, I have two choices here. I can stay general counsel and keep telling everyone
    how to optimize their candy enjoyment while reminding them of the various sugar-related
    risks, all the while secretly salivating with my hands and mouth pressed against
    the window of the candy store. Or I can get in and gorge on the candy. So I decided
    to do the latter. I’ll get in early, help build the blockchain industry, and enjoy
    the process firsthand, instead of vicariously through the experiences of my colleagues.
