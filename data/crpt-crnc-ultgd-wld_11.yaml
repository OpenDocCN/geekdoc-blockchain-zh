    a major evolution with an endless stream of improvements with each new emerging

    currency that has lots of advantages.

- en: They are defined variously as "autonomous machines," "contracts between parties
    stored on a blockchain" or "any computation that takes place on a blockchain."
    Many debates about the nature of smart contracts are really just contests between
    competing terminologies. The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare
    the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a
    notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you
    simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e., ledger), and your escrow,
    driver's license, or whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts
    not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that
    a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations.

  zh: 它们被各种方式定义为“自主机器”、“存储在区块链上的双方合同”或“在区块链上进行的任何计算”。关于智能合约本质的许多争论实际上只是竞争性术语之间的较量。描述智能合约的最佳方式是将这种技术比作自动售货机。通常，你会去找律师或公证人，付给他们钱，然后等待你拿到文件。有了智能合约，你只需将比特币投进自动售货机（即账本），你的托管、驾照或
    whatever就会落入你的账户。更重要的是，智能合约不仅像传统合同那样定义协议的规则和处罚，还能自动执行这些义务。
- en: Another way to understanding smart contracts is to realize that these are digital
    versions of real contracts. With a standard contract between two parties, you
    have an agreement that stipulates what each party must do for the transaction
    to be completed. The contract actually sets the parameters of who does what, when
    to do it, how to do it, and what happens once it’s been done.

  zh: 理解智能合约的另一种方式是认识到这些其实就像是真实合同的数字版本。在双方之间有一个标准的合同，你们有一个协议，规定了各方在交易完成时必须做些什么。合同实际上设定了谁做什么、何时做、如何做以及一旦完成会发生什么的具体参数。
- en: Up until Smart Contracts, these agreements have only been in verbal or written
    form subjected to territorial laws and regulations of the land where they were
    drawn up. Also, with these contracts, the terms of the contract could always subject
    to interpretation.

- en: Today’s Smart Contracts improve on all of that. Firstly, these digital agreements
    are designed to be self-executing and enforced without any additional party to
    weigh in on the matter. There is no need to have the language of the agreement
    interpreted in any way.

    computer code and programming languages that stipulate the terms and expectations

- en: There are many advantages to this form of coded contracts that you may not readily
    recognize. These contracts do not need a company or regulations to enforce them.
    This means that there is no longer a bureaucracy or any associated costs for such
    services. They can actually be something like a do-it-yourself contract allowing
    them to self-manage based on the terms agreed upon by only the parties involved.
    Basically, you could look at them as programmable money, allowing users to solve
    common problems themselves.

- en: Insiders vouch that it is extremely hard for our voting system to be rigged,
    but nonetheless, smart contracts would allay all concerns by providing an infinitely
    more secure system. Ledger-protected votes would need to be decoded and require
    excessive computing power to access. No one has that much computing power, so
    it would need God to hack the system! Secondly, smart contracts could hike low
    voter turnout. Much of the inertia comes from a fumbling system that includes
    lining up, showing your identity, and completing forms. With smart contracts,
    volunteers can transfer voting online, and millennials will turn out en masse
    to vote for their Potus.

- en: The blockchain not only provides a single ledger as a source of trust, but also
    shaves possible snarls in communication and workflow because of its accuracy,
    transparency, and automated system. Ordinarily, business operations have to endure
    a back-and-forth, while waiting for approvals and for internal or external issues
    to sort themselves out. A blockchain ledger streamlines this. It also cuts out
    discrepancies that typically occur with independent processing, and that may lead
    to costly lawsuits and settlement delays.

    to super-smart robots. Think of a future where everything is automated. Google's
    getting there with smartphones, smart glasses, and even smart cars. That's where
    smart contracts help. One example is the self-autonomous or self-parking vehicles,
    where smart contracts could put into play a sort of ‘oracle' that could detect
    who was at fault in a crash; the sensor or the driver, as well as countless other
    variables. Using smart contracts, an automobile insurance company could charge
    rates differently based on where, and under which, conditions customers are operating
    their vehicles.
