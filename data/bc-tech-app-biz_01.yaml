- en: The success of this book is due to commitments of several parties. I would thank
    all the authors who have contributed to this book for their time and their dedication.
    Furthermore, I would thank all the reviewers, who always offer their free and
    sincere contribution to the developments of both the scientific community and
    the society at large. I would also thank all companies and stakeholders who have
    interacted with us during the whole journey. A big thank goes to my wife, Maria,
    and to my kids, Maria Greta and Riccardo, who always support me with care and
    love and push me to be on top. Finally, a sincere thank goes to my parents, Domenico
    and Angelina, who always believed and trusted me – even without using any blockchain
    technology– especially when I was a young scholar. I dedicate to them this book
    along with the whole journey of my career.
